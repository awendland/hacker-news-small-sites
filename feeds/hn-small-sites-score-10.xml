	<p>
		<em>The software industry loves young people, but old-timers serve an important purpose, too.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Our culture idolises youth. There's several reasons for this, I believe. Youth seems synonymous with vigour, strength, beauty, and many other desirable qualities. The cynical perspective is that young people, while rebellious, also tend to be easy to manipulate, if you know which buttons to push. A middle-aged man like me isn't susceptible to the argument that I should buy a particular pair of Nike shoes because they're named after Michael Jordan, but for a while, one pair wasn't enough for my teenage daughter.
	</p>
	<p>
		In intellectual pursuits (like software development), youth is often extolled as the source of innovation. You're often confronted with examples like that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Évariste Galois</a>, who made all his discoveries before turning 21. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> was around 28 years when she produced what is considered the 'first computer program'. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> was 24 when he wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof">On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Clearly, young age is no detriment to making ground-breaking contributions. It has even become folklore that everyone past the age of 35 is a has-been whose only chance at academic influence is to write a textbook.
	</p>
	<h3 id="800321a74c054ea0b75815c86f4ce18d">
		The story of the five monkeys <a href="#800321a74c054ea0b75815c86f4ce18d" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		You may have seen a story called <em>the five monkeys experiment</em>. It's most likely a fabrication, but it goes like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		A group of scientists placed five monkeys in a cage, and in the middle, a ladder with bananas on the top. Every time a monkey went up the ladder, the scientists soaked the rest of the monkeys with cold water. After a while, every time a monkey went up the ladder, the others would beat it up.
	</p>
	<p>
		After some time, none of the monkeys dared go up the ladder regardless of the temptation. The scientists then substituted one of the monkeys with a new one, who'd immediately  go for the bananas, only to be beaten up by the others. After several beatings, the new member learned not to climb the ladder even though it never knew why.
	</p>
	<p>
		A second monkey was substituted and the same occurred. The first monkey participated in beating the second. A third monkey was exchanged and the story repeated. The fourth was substituted and the beating was repeated. Finally the fifth monkey was replaced.
	</p>
	<p>
		Left was a group of five monkeys who, even though they never received a cold shower, continued to beat up any monkey who attempted to climb the ladder. If it was possible to ask the monkeys why they would beat up all who attempted to go up the ladder, the answer would probably be:
	</p>
	<p>
		"That's how we do things here."
	</p>
	<p>
		While the story is probably just that: a story, it tells us something about the drag induced by age and experience. If you've been in the business for decades, you've seen numerous failed attempts at something you yourself tried when you were young. You know that it can't be done.
	</p>
	<p>
		Young people don't know that a thing can't be done. If they can avoid the monkey-beating, they'll attempt the impossible.
	</p>
	<h3 id="4add8a9af0424d7e889d3125837ed611">
		Changing circumstances <a href="#4add8a9af0424d7e889d3125837ed611" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Is attempting the impossible a good idea?
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, no, because it's... impossible. There's a reason older people tell young people that a thing can't be done. It's not just because they're stodgy conservatives who abhor change. It's because they see the effort as wasteful. Perhaps they're even trying to be kind, guiding young people off a path where only toil and disappointment is to be found.
	</p>
	<p>
		What old people don't realise is that sometimes, circumstances change.
	</p>
	<p>
		What was impossible twenty years ago may not be impossible today. We see this happening in many fields. Producing a commercially viable electric car was impossible for decades, until, with the advances made in battery technology, it became possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Technology changes rapidly in software development. People trying something previously impossible may find that it's possible today. Once, if you had lots of data, you had to store it in fully normalised form, because storage was expensive. For a decade, relational databases were the only game in town. Then circumstances changed. Storage became cheaper, and a new movement of NoSQL storage emerged. What was before impossible became possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Older people often don't see the new opportunities, because they 'know' that some things are impossible. Young people push the envelope driven by a combination of zest and ignorance. Most fail, but a few succeed.
	</p>

		Lottery of the impossible <a href="#4272a069588e47f796646bd282b9de02" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I think of this process as a lottery. Imagine that every impossible thing is a red ball in an urn. Every young person who tries the impossible draws a random ball from the urn.
	</p>
	<p>
		The urn contains millions of red balls, but every now and then, one of them turns green. You don't know which one, but if you draw it, it represents something that was previously impossible which has now become possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		This process produces growth, because once discovered, the new and better way of doing things can improve society in general. Occasionally, the young discoverer may even gain some fame and fortune.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems wasteful, though. Most people who attempt the impossible will reach the predictable conclusion. What was deemed impossible was, indeed, impossible.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm in a cynical mood, I don't think that it's youth in itself that is the source of progress. It's just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large numbers</a> applied. If there's a one in million chance that something will succeed, but ten million people attempt it, it's only a matter of time before one succeeds.
	</p>
	<p>
		Society at large can benefit from the success of the few, but ten million people still wasted their efforts.
	</p>
	<h3 id="016744f0ea77495c958a7914f08187db">
		We need the old, too <a href="#016744f0ea77495c958a7914f08187db" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		If you accept the argument that young people are more likely to try the impossible, we need the young people. Do we need the old people?
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm turning fifty in 2020. You may consider that old, but I expect to work for many more years. I don't know if the software industry needs fifty-year-olds, but that's not the kind of old I have in mind. I'm thinking of people who have retired, or are close to retirement.
	</p>
	<p>
		In our youth-glorifying culture, we tend to dismiss the opinion and experiences of old people. <em>Oh, well, it's just a codgy old man</em> (or woman), we'll say.
	</p>
	<p>
		We ignore the experience of the old, because we believe that they haven't been keeping up with times. Their experiences don't apply to us, because we live under new circumstance. Well, see above.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not advocating that we turn into a gerontocracy that venerates our elders solely because of their age. Again, according to the law of large numbers, some people live to old age. There need not be any correlation between survivors and wisdom.
	</p>
	<p>
		We need the old to tell us the truth, because they have little to lose.
	</p>
	<h3 id="8b5c613ba6c44bb4b4e6dbba7ae7d19a">
		Nothing to lose <a href="#8b5c613ba6c44bb4b4e6dbba7ae7d19a" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		In the last couple of years, I've noticed a trend. A book comes out, exposing the sad state of affairs in some organisation. This has happened regularly in Denmark, where I live. One book may expose the deplorable conditions of the Danish tax authorities, one may describe the situation in the ministry of defence, one criticises the groupthink associated with the climate crisis, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Invariably, it turns out that the book is written by a professor emeritus or a retired department head.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't think that these people, all of a sudden, had an epiphany after they retired. They knew all about the rot in the system they were part of, while they were part of it, but they've had too much to lose. You could argue that they should have said something before they retired, but that requires a moral backbone we can't expect most people to have.
	</p>
	<p>
		When people retire, the threat of getting fired disappears. Old people can speak freely to a degree most other people can't.
	</p>
	<p>
		Granted, many may simply use that freedom to spew bile or shout <em>Get off my lawn!</em>, but many are in the unique position to reveal truths no-one else dare speak. Many are, perhaps, just bitter, but some may possess knowledge that they are in a unique position to reveal.
	</p>
	<p>
		When that grumpy old guy on Twitter writes something that makes you uncomfortable, consider this: he may still be right.
	</p>
	<h3 id="2d64bd2c7ccb4b7ca2418802ed82689e">
		Being unreasonable <a href="#2d64bd2c7ccb4b7ca2418802ed82689e" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		In a way, you could say that we need young and old people for the same fundamental reason. Not all of them, but enough of them, are in a position to be unreasonable.
		</p><blockquote>
			<p>
				"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."
			</p>
			
		</blockquote><p>
		Young people and old people are unreasonable in each their own way, and we need both.
	</p>
	<h3 id="df88f595ec814e2bafcbd018ff5f5ad2">
		Conclusion <a href="#df88f595ec814e2bafcbd018ff5f5ad2" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		We need young people in the software development industry. Because of their vigour and inexperience, they'll push the envelope. Most will fail to do the impossible, but a few succeed.
	</p>
	<p>
		This may seem like a cynical view, but we've all been young, and most of us have been through such a phase. It's like a rite of passage, and even if you fail to make your mark on the world, you're still likely to have learned a lot.
	</p>
	<p>
		We need old people because they're in a position to speak truth to the world. Notice that I didn't make my argument about the <em>experience</em> of old-timers. Actually, I find that valuable as well, but that's the ordinary argument: <em>Listen to old people, because they have experience and wisdom.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of them do, at least.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn't make much out of that argument, because you already know it. There'd be no reason to write this essay if that was all I had to say. Old people have less on the line, so they can speak more freely. If someone you used to admire retires and all of a sudden starts saying or writing unpleasant and surprising things, there might be a good explanation, and it might be a good idea to pay attention.
	</p>
	<p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Microsoft Teams as a platform" itemref="hero-page-title"><div>
<p>2020 became the year of #WFH (work from home) and for many organizations also the turning point when Microsoft Teams became the primary place where being “at work” happens. This is accelerating the evolution of Teams from being merely a communication tool that connects human beings into a foundational service layer for many types of business applications.</p>



<p>How the concept of Teams as a platform contrasts with Microsoft’s Power Platform suite of technology is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. In this post I’ll first reflect on the relatively short history of where Teams came from. I’ll then examine how the recent feature announcements are brining apps front &amp; center in Teams. Finally, a few words on the possible future for Teams as part of Microsoft’s broader strategy.</p>



<h2>The road that lead to Teams</h2>



<p>Looking back ~10 years, the real-time communication &amp; instant messaging tools from MS seemed to be going through an endless renaming cycle: from OCS to Lync to Skype for Business. The core feature set presented to the end user didn’t seem to evolve nearly as much as product branding did. On a broader level, the communication activities of information workers within an organization still typically took place within Outlook’s inbox, and different servers like SharePoint and Dynamics CRM all packed their own features for posting short messages to other users.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>4 years ago, when the first images of what was then called “Skype Teams” started to leak out, we were already waiting for MS to create something a bit more ambitious than just another online meeting tool. Office Groups had began to emerge in various different places inside the MS Cloud, but they were primarily a technical construct with no sensible UX for everyday people to approach them. Even Dynamics CRM had it’s own solution that attempted to bring together the dicussion, calendars, notes, documents and team memberships from under an Office 365 Group associated with a record like account or opportunity:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/basics/collaborate-with-colleagues-using-office-365-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/basics/media/office-groups-dashboard.png" alt=""></a></figure></div>



<p>I remember having many discussions with our CRM customers where I attempted to steer people away from deploying this Groups solution. Instead I wanted to encourage them to wait for something a bit more polished that I knew had to be on it’s way sooner or later.</p>



<p>At one point there was a clear &amp; present danger of another “Yammer moment” taking place, as Microsoft was reportedly quite serious about their plans to acquire Slack. In retrospect it was a blessing for both parties that MS decided to keep investing in building their own product, instead of trying to retrofit an established service like Slack into their existing software offering.</p>



<p>I would argue that this “build over buy” strategy which Microsoft has since then followed across their business software stack has been a key success factor for BizApps in particular.  It has enabled MS to move from merely chasing CRM competitors like Salesforce into redefining the business apps playing field with Power Platform. There’s a stark difference between acquiring companies and bundling them as “X Cloud” versus engineering your own software stack to act as a true platform.</p>



<h2>Teams: the collaboration chapter</h2>



<p>Initially the first version of the Microsoft Teams product that became generally available in Spring 2017 was pretty much focused on being three things: </p>



<ol><li>Replacement for Skype for Business</li><li>Alternative to Slack</li><li>UI layer for Office 365 Groups</li></ol>



<p>From a business applications perspective there wasn’t all that much you could do to hook Teams up with Dynamics 365, until Fall 2018 when the previews for the first integrated features were launched. In particular the integrated file sharing experience that Teams offered seemed almost like the Holy Grail for many CRM professionals, offering to fix the glaring hole in the SharePoint integration story that lacked any security model synchronization. The roadmap image below presents the plans from 2 years ago on how Teams and Dynamics 365 were going to be integrated:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The last item on the roadmap has still not been delivered, which is the visibility of Teams conversations inside the Dynamics 365 record form. Why this hasn’t been a higher priority for MS to implement seems to me like a sign of how Microsoft Teams is nowadays positioned as the primary UI for all information work. MS probably would prefer if everything always started from inside Teams. You pin record tabs into channels, you show previews of records inside teams discussions, you interact with records via bot interfaces and so on. As long as Teams is that big umbrella under which all work takes place.</p>



<p>The lack of a deep 2-way integration does not therefore mean that investments aren’t being made into the products involved. It can simply be a reflection of the new vision that is being built, by aligning many existing services to form a whole that aims to be greater than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p>As an example, if you look at Microsoft’s task management story, you’ll see that features and data from across various apps like To Do, Planner and Outlook tasks / flagged emails are currently being collapsed into a central location that is the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-tasks-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tasks app for Teams</a>. Tasks as a generic construct don’t necessarily need to be fully controlled by a single database, yet they very much need to be logically represented within “the hub for teamwork” that Teams is positioned as.</p>



<p>Going forward, when new apps appear into the MS cloud product portfolio and they need to offer task management features to users, the logical integration point to focus on would be Teams. For activity feed type of functionality the choice is even more clear for product development: choose to piggyback on Teams instead of inventing yet another stream of short messages.</p>



<h2>Teams: the platform chapter</h2>



<p>Moving beyond simply integrating Teams with products X, Y and Z, we’re now seeing the rise of a model where apps are built specifically to be used in Teams. This has of course been possible for a long time already, by developing custom web services and using the SDKs. Now there are many features coming up that will amplify the platform story around Teams on the no-code/low-code front specifically.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/215495iAC8095B3BF8D5E46/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999" alt="lists in teams1.png"></figure>



<p>Microsoft Lists app has been the  first to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/microsoft-lists-in-microsoft-teams-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/1621979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reach GA</a> and offers an ultra low barrier for users to process data in a single table through a configurable, readymade UI. When accessed via Teams, the list data gains one more special dimension: discussions to be had regarding a list item. This is pretty much the same as the usage pattern offered for a Dynamics 365 record with the integration mentioned earlier.</p>



<p>Underneath the new covers of MS Lists is the technology familiar from SharePoint lists. If we were to only examine the UI layer, there is actually a remarkable similarity to a popular no-code service called Airtable. So much that the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mspoweruser.com/airtable-accuses-microsoft-of-copying-its-service/" target="_blank">accusations</a> of MS simply copying the visuals and core features from this competitor don’t seem entirely unjustified. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams.png" alt="" width="583" height="729" srcset="https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams.png 777w, https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams-240x300.png 240w, https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams-768x961.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px"></figure>



<p>Comparing these two offerings gives us some perspective on what exactly is the market position these tools are aiming to conquer. Simple lists themselves are not a particularly unique feature, rather it’s the team collaboration capabilities and ease of data sharing that turns these tables into what you’d call an actual app. Incidentally, just this week Airtable <a href="https://blog.airtable.com/airtable-platform-launch-automations-sync-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> they were building a full platform with apps offering JavaScript based extensibility, a marketplace for sharing apps, automations for executing business logic, and finally a sync service to transfer data across environments (“bases”).</p>



<p>Collaboration scenarios around semi-structured data like lists and Excel style tables can be seen as a  gateway drug. They allow turning email or paper based manual processes into a quick first draft of what the digital process could be like. If there are indeed clear business benefits in automating the said process, the requirements for more complex app features will soon begin to emerge from the user base. Hence the collaboration platform should offer an obvious path to grow these pre-built app experiences into more advanced no-code/low-code apps.</p>



<h2>Project Oakdale a.k.a bringing CDS to Teams</h2>



<p>If Microsoft Lists is the equivalent of an Excel table within the Teams context, then <a href="https://jukkaniiranen.com/2020/07/dataflex-is-more-and-less-than-cds/">Project Oakdale</a> / “CDS Lite” could be though of as bringing SQL Server inside Teams. Now, obviously Microsoft has zero intent on actually replacing Excel nor SQL with features built into Teams. They only need to introduce those parts that make sense from a team collabocation perspective.</p>



<p>Microsoft Lists is a far cry from what a real Excel workbook can do, yet it can offer much more value in a collaboration scenarios that those lone .xlsx files ever could. Similarly, the version of CDS that will very soon be available for building Power Apps within Teams is nowhere near as powerful as the services powering enterprise CRM systems like Dynamics 365 (or the raw power offered by SQL). Still, the fact that it can be found from within every team and used by a much larger audience than what Power Apps citizen developer tools could hope to capture – those are the factors that can truly make CDS a mainstream service that most information workers in the Microsoft 365 cloud interact it.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oakdale_Teams_table_design-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oakdale_Teams_table_design-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oakdale_Teams_table_design-300x169.jpg 300w, https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oakdale_Teams_table_design-768x432.jpg 768w, https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oakdale_Teams_table_design.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The experience of defining the CDS data model in Project Oakdale will be very different from the path that Power Apps makers have gone through – let alone the XRM veterans. In fact, you could easily mistake the table design and row entry UX to be that of Microsoft Lists rather than CDS. This highlights a key aspect that not all Power Platform experts may yet have grasped: for MS this “CDS Lite” is not so much about deciding what premium features of the full Power Platform to give away for free to Teams subscibers – rather it’s about how to best simplify the enterprise CRM features of CDS into a new product that Teams users could adopt on their own.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean that …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Are you a ham radio operator interested in DMR? Getting started can be intimidating, but not with the <a href="https://www.bridgecomsystems.com/pages/plug-and-play-878-plus-skybridge">SkyBridge Hotspot DMR Plug N’ Play package</a> from BridgeCom Systems. </p>



<p>BridgeCom’s SkyBridge dual band hotspot is the latest hotspot on the market for amateur radio operators. What makes it such a compelling buy is the ease at which you can get on the air. BridgeCom will take care of programming the radio <em>and</em> the hotspot before it ships. Once it arrives, simply plug in the hotspot, turn on the radio and you’re on the air rag chewing. </p>



<h2>BridgeCom SkyBridge Hotspot features</h2>



<p>The SkyBridges uses a Pi-Zero board with a custom MMDVM hat putting out 10mW of output power. More than enough power to blanket your entire house and property (unless you live on acres of property) with seamless digital coverage. </p>



<ul><li>Wired and wireless Internet capability</li><li>High-performance 32-bit ARM processor</li><li>SkyBridge&nbsp;Board Fully Assembled And Tested</li><li><a href="https://www.pistar.uk/">Pi-Star Operating System</a></li><li>Compatible with DMR, D-Star, Yaesu System Fuzion (YSF),&nbsp; NXDN, P25 and POCSAG radios</li><li>Supports the following Cross-Mode Capabilities: DMR to NXDN, DMR to YSF, YSF to DMR and YSF to NXDN</li><li>Supports operation in both 2m (144Mhz) and 70cm (440Mhz) bands</li><li>Onboard LEDs to show status (Tx, Rx, PTT, Mode)</li><li>Up to 10mW RF power</li><li>SMA antenna connector, dual-band VHF/UHF antenna included</li><li>MMDVM open-source firmware is pre-loaded and is easily upgraded via software</li><li>Built-in 1.3″ OLED display</li><li>Connection for Nextion LCD display</li><li><strong>1 Year Warranty</strong></li><li><strong>FCC Part 15 Certified</strong></li></ul>



<p>The most important thing you get, in my opinion, is fantastic support form BridgeCom. You’re paying for the piece of mind you’ll have someone to call if you have troubles, or something malfunctions. You will also get access to BridgeCom University, and online portal that provides a long list of videos that will help you learn everything you need to know about DMR. </p>







<h2>How far does the BridgeCom SkyBridge reach?</h2>



<p>Many hams wonder just how far a little 10mW transmitter will work. The answer is— surprisingly far. I set my SkyBridge near the window in my basement and was able to walk about 600 feet in my suburban neighborhood before losing the signal from my hotspot. Don’t worry about having coverage around your home or property. This hotspot has you covered! I <a href="http://k0lwc.com/what-is-the-range-of-a-dmr-hotspot/">tested the coverage from my PiSpot</a> with a high gain antenna at 40 feet HAAT, it’s worth checking out. </p>



<h2>Is the SkyBridge hotspot reliable?</h2>



<p>I was able to use the SkyBridge for a week and I found it to be incredibly reliable. It handled my day-to-day just as well as my PiSpot hotspot running a Raspberry PiB3 board and a DVMega hat. In fact, it ran cooler in temperature than my custom built PiB3. </p>



<h2>Can I talk to friends who use D-Star or YSF?</h2>



<p>Yes! The hotspot supports cross-mode capability thanks to the Pi-Star firmware. You can use your DMR radio to talk to your ham radio friends who may be using D-Star, YSF, P25 or NXDN. This is huge. It sucks we have a fragmented digital protocol system. With this hotspot that becomes less of an issue.</p>



<h2>Is the SkyBridge hotspot worth the money?</h2>



<p>If you’re a ham looking to make the jump into DMR, I think it’s absolutely worth it. The real value of the SkyBridge Plug N’ Play package is the ease of getting on the air. BridgeCom makes it incredibly easy. Pair that with access to BridgeCom University you can watch hours and hours worth of tutorials on DMR — that’s a lot of value in a single package. </p>



<p>You can buy the BridgeCom SkyBridge hotspot <a href="https://www.bridgecomsystems.com/pages/skybridge">here</a>, or get their SkyBridge Plug N’ Play package <a href="https://www.bridgecomsystems.com/pages/plug-and-play-878-plus-skybridge">here</a>. </p>

        <section>
            <p><em>The Little Things</em> is a new series of posts based on Locksley's internal training sessions. Often the contents are either proprietary (e.g. the inner workings of specific master key platforms) or not generally interesting (e.g. our internal libraries and tooling), but sometimes the contents are suitable for a wider audience, in which case I want to share them.</p>
<hr>
<p>This post will be about some source-level techniques for speeding up C++ compilation, and their (dis)advantages. It will <strong>not</strong> talk about things external to C++, such as buying better hardware, using a better build system, or using smarter linker<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. It will also not talk about the tooling that can find compilation bottlenecks, as that will be a subject of a later post.</p>
<h2 id="overviewofccompilationmodel">Overview of C++ compilation model</h2>
<p>I will start with a quick overview of the C++ compilation model, to provide context for some of the tricks I will show later. Note that this overview will be very coarse, if you want a detailed look at the subtleties of the <em>9</em> phase compilation model defined in the C++ standard, look elsewhere.</p>
<p>We will consider the compilation of C++ binary to happen in 3 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preprocessing</li>
<li>Compilation</li>
<li>Linking</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="preprocessing">Preprocessing</h3>
<p>The first step is preprocessing. During it, the preprocessor takes a .cpp file and parses it, looking for <em>preprocessor directives</em>, such as <code>#include</code>, <code>#define</code>, <code>#ifdef</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Let's take this super simple file as an example</p>
<pre><code>// tiny.cpp
#define KONSTANTA 123

int main() {
    return KONSTANTA;
}
</code></pre>
<p>It contains one preprocessor directive, <code>#define</code>. It says that any following occurence of <code>KONSTANTA</code> should be replaced with <code>123</code>. Running the file through a preprocessor leads to output like this one:</p>
<pre><code>$ clang++ -E tiny.cpp
# 1 "tiny.cpp"
# 1 "&lt;built-in&gt;" 1
# 1 "&lt;built-in&gt;" 3
# 383 "&lt;built-in&gt;" 3
# 1 "&lt;command line&gt;" 1
# 1 "&lt;built-in&gt;" 2
# 1 "tiny.cpp" 2


int main() {
    return 123;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that in <code>return KONSTANTA</code> the <code>KONSTANTA</code> part was replaced with <code>123</code>, as it should be. We also see that the compiler left itself a bunch of other notes, that we do not care about that much<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The big problem with the preprocessor model is that the <code>#include</code> directive literally means "copy-paste all of this file's contents here". Of course, if that file's contents contain further <code>#include</code> directives, then more files will be opened, their contents copied out, and in turn, the compiler will have more code to deal with. In other words, preprocessing increases the size of the input, usually significantly so.</p>
<p>The following is a simple "Hello World" in C++, using streams.</p>
<pre><code>// hello-world.cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World\n";
}
</code></pre>
<p>After preprocessing, the file will have <strong>28115</strong><sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> lines for the next step, compilation, to deal with.</p>
<pre><code>$ clang++ -E hello-world.cpp | wc -l
28115
</code></pre>
<h3 id="compilation">Compilation</h3>
<p>After a file is preprocessed, it is compiled into an <em>object file</em>. Object files contain the actual code to run, but cannot be run without linking. One of the reasons for this is that object files can refer to symbols (usually functions) that they do not have the definition (code) for. This happens, e.g. if a .cpp file uses a function that has been declared, but not defined, like so:</p>
<pre><code>// unlinked.cpp
void bar(); // defined elsewhere (hopefully)

void foo() {
    bar();
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can look inside a compiled object file to see what symbols it provides and what symbols it needs, using <code>nm</code> (Linux) or <code>dumpbin</code> (Windows). If we look at the output for the <code>unlinked.cpp</code> file, we get this:</p>
<pre><code>$ clang++ -c unlinked.cpp &amp;&amp; nm -C unlinked.o
                 U bar()
0000000000000000 T foo()
</code></pre>
<p><code>U</code> means that the symbol is not defined in this object file. <code>T</code> means that the symbol is in the text/code section and that it is exported, which means that other object files can get <code>foo</code> from this <code>unlinked.o</code>. It is important to know that symbols might also be present in an object file, but not be available to other object files. Such symbols are marked with <code>t</code>.</p>
<h3 id="linking">Linking</h3>
<p>After all the files have been compiled into object files, they have to be <em>linked</em> into the final binary artefact. During linking, all the various object files are smashed together in a specific format, e.g. ELF, and the various references to undefined symbols in object files are resolved with the address of the symbol, as provided by a different object file (or library).</p>
<p>With this overview done, we can start tackling the different ways to speed up the compilation of your code. Let's start simple.</p>
<h2 id="includeless"><code>#include</code> less</h2>
<p>Including a file usually brings in a <em>lot</em> of extra code, which the compiler then needs to parse and check. Thus the simplest, and usually also the biggest, way to speed up the compilation of your code, is to just <code>#include</code> fewer files. Reducing the include set is especially beneficial in header files, as they are likely to be included from other files, thus amplifying the impact of your improvements.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to remove any unused includes. Unused includes shouldn't happen often, but sometimes they are left behind during refactoring, and using a tool like <a href="https://include-what-you-use.org/">IWYU</a> <em>can</em><sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> make it simple to do. However, just cleaning up unused includes is unlikely to provide many benefits, and so you will have to reach for bigger guns, forward declarations and manual outlining.</p>
<p>But before explaining forward declarations and manual outlining, I want to go over the costs of header inclusion quickly, so we can build up intuition on what sort of speed-ups we can expect from pruning down include graphs.</p>

<p>The table below shows the time required by Clang<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> to compile a file that <em>only</em> includes some stdlib headers.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>header(s) included</th>
<th>time to compile (ms)</th>
<th>difference from baseline (ms)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>none</td>
<td>11.3  ± 0.2</td>

<tr>
<td><code>&lt;vector&gt;</code></td>
<td>68.8  ± 0.3</td>
<td>57.5 ±  0.36</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;string&gt;</code></td>
<td>136.3  ± 0.8</td>
<td>125.0 ±  0.82</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td><code>&lt;vector&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</code></td>
<td>156.1  ± 0.8</td>
<td>144.8 ±  0.82</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The first row shows the time needed to compile a completely empty file, to provide a baseline time required by the compiler to start, read the file, and do nothing. The other lines are more interesting. As the second line says, just including <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code> adds 57 ms to compilation times, even though there will be no actual line emitted. As we can see, the cost to include <code>&lt;string&gt;</code> is more than double of <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code>, and the cost to include <code>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</code> is about the same as for <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>More interesting are the rows for combinations of headers, because no combination of headers is as expensive as compiling each of them on its own. The reason is quite simple: their internal include overlap. The most extreme case is <code>&lt;string&gt;</code> + <code>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</code>, because <code>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</code> is basically <code>&lt;string&gt;</code> + couple of types deriving from <code>std::exception</code>.</p>
<p>What you should take away from this are two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if you do not use anything from a header, you still have to pay for it.</li>
<li>Include costs do not neatly sum, nor subtract.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's go through techniques we can use to include fewer files.</p>
<h3 id="forwarddeclarations">Forward declarations</h3>
<p>Quite often, when we mention a type, we only need to know that it exists but do not need to know its definition. The common case is creating a pointer or a reference to a type, in which case you need a knowledge that the type exists (a <em>forward declaration</em>), but not what it looks like (a <em>definition</em>).</p>
<p>As an example, this header is valid:</p>
<pre><code>class KeyShape; // forward declaration

size_t count_differences(KeyShape const&amp; lhs, KeyShape const&amp; rhs);
</code></pre>
<p>as long as the implementation file includes the appropriate headers:</p>
<pre><code>#include "key-shape.hpp" // provides the full definition of KeyShape

size_t count_differences(KeyShape const&amp; lhs, KeyShape const&amp; rhs) {
    assert(lhs.positions() == rhs.positions());
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use forward declaration together with some templated classes, whose size does not change depending on the template argument, e.g. <code>std::unique_ptr</code> and <code>std::vector</code><sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>. However, doing so can force you to outline your constructors, destructors and other special member functions (<em>SMFs</em>), as those usually need to see the full definition of the type. Your code then ends up looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>// foo.hpp
#include &lt;memory&gt;

class Bar;

class Foo {
    std::unique_ptr&lt;Bar&gt; m_ptr;
public:
    Foo(); // = default;
    ~Foo(); // = default;
};
</code></pre>
<pre><code>// foo.cpp
#include "bar.hpp"

Foo::Foo() = default;
Foo::~Foo() = default;
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we still use the compiler-generated default constructor and destructor, but do so in the <code>.cpp</code> file, where we see the full definition of <code>Bar</code>. I also like to use the <code>// = default;</code> comment to signal to other programmers reading the code that the SMF is explicitly declared but will be defaulted, and thus there won't be any special logic in it.</p>
<p>When using this technique, please remember that the outlined functions cannot be inlined without LTO. In other words, you probably do not want to outline <em>every</em> function just because you can, because calling trivial functions can be much more expensive than inlining their code directly.</p>
<h3 id="explicitoutlining">Explicit outlining</h3>
<p>The idea underlying explicit outlining is quite simple: sometimes we get better results if a piece of code is explicitly split away from a function. One of the most common reasons is, perhaps ironically, improving inlining by making the common path of a function small. However, in our case, the reason for doing this is to improve the compilation times.</p>
<p>If a piece of code is expensive to compile, and inlining it is not crucial for performance, only one TU has to pay for compiling it. The canonical example of this is throwing an exception in general, and exceptions from <code>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</code> in particular. Throwing an exception generates quite a lot of code, and throwing more complex standard exception types, such as <code>std::runtime_error</code>, also requires an expensive<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> header, <code>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</code> to be included.</p>
<p>By instead replacing all <code>throw foo;</code> statements with calls to a helper function along the lines of <code>[[noreturn]] void throw_foo(char const* msg)</code>, the call sites become …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Almost three decades ago, one of us, Jack Goldstone, published a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Rebellion-Early-Modern-World/dp/1138222127/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_0/140-4438334-0411838?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1138222127&amp;pd_rd_r=48abcf2c-170c-43f1-ac2b-6aceb88ec983&amp;pd_rd_w=ROnfs&amp;pd_rd_wg=qroCO&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-">simple model</a> to determine a country’s vulnerability to political crisis. The model was based on how population changes shifted state, elite and popular behavior. Goldstone argued that, according to this Demographic-Structural Theory, in the 21st century, America was likely to get a populist, America-first leader who would sow a whirlwind of conflict.</p>



<p>Then ten years ago, the other of us, Peter Turchin, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237458">applied</a> Goldstone’s model to U.S. history, using current data. What emerged was alarming: The U.S. was heading toward the highest level of vulnerability to political crisis seen in this country in over a hundred years. Even before Trump was elected, Turchin <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/463608a">published</a> his prediction that the U.S. was headed for the “Turbulent Twenties,” forecasting a period of growing instability in the United States and western Europe.</p>



<p>Given the Black Lives Matter protests and cascading clashes between competing armed factions in cities across the United States, from Portland, Oregon to Kenosha, Wisconsin, we are already well on our way there. But worse likely lies ahead.</p>



<p>Our model is based on the fact that across history, what creates the risk of political instability is the behavior of elites, who all too often react to long-term increases in population by committing three cardinal sins. First, faced with a surge of labor that dampens growth in wages and productivity, elites<strong> </strong><em>seek to take a larger portion of economic gains for themselves</em>, driving up inequality. Second, facing greater competition for elite wealth and status, <em>they tighten up the path to mobility to favor themselves and their progeny</em>. For example, in an increasingly meritocratic society, elites could keep places at top universities limited and raise the entry requirements and costs in ways that favor the children of those who had already succeeded. </p>



<p>Third, anxious to hold on to their rising fortunes, they <em>do all they can to resist taxation of their wealth and profits</em>, even if that means starving the government of needed revenues, leading to decaying infrastructure, declining public services and fast-rising government debts.</p>



<p>Such selfish elites lead the way to revolutions. They create simmering conditions of greater inequality and declining effectiveness of, and respect for, government. But their actions alone are not sufficient. Urbanization and greater education are needed to create concentrations of aware and organized groups in the populace who can mobilize and act for change.</p>

<p>Top leadership matters. Leaders who aim to be inclusive and solve national problems can manage conflicts and defer a crisis. However, leaders who seek to benefit from and fan political divisions bring the final crisis closer. Typically, tensions build between elites who back a leader seeking to preserve their privileges and reforming elites who seek to rally popular support for major changes to bring a more open and inclusive social order. Each side works to paint the other as a fatal threat to society, creating such deep polarization that little of value can be accomplished, and problems grow worse until a crisis comes along that explodes the fragile social order.</p>



<p>These were the conditions that prevailed in the lead-up to the great upheavals in political history, from the French Revolution in the eighteenth century, to the revolutions of 1848 and the U.S. Civil War in the nineteenth century, the Russian and Chinese revolutions of the twentieth century and the many “color revolutions” that opened the twenty-first century. So, it is eye-opening that the data show very similar conditions now building up in the United States.</p>



<p>In applying our model to the U.S., we tracked a number of indicators of popular well-being, inequality and political polarization, all the way from 1800 to the present. These included the ratio of median workers’ wages to GDP per capita, life expectancy, the number of new millionaires and their influence on politics, the degree of strict party-line voting in Congress, and the incidence of deadly riots, terrorism and political assassinations. We found that all of these indicators pointed to two broad cycles in U.S. history.</p>



<p>In the decades following independence, despite growing party competition, elites in office often compromised and voted together, and rising national prosperity was broadly shared. But that wave of positive conditions peaked around 1820; from there, political polarization and economic inequality rose sharply in the years leading up to the Civil War. The crisis indicators peaked in the 1860s but did not fall sharply after the war; instead, they remained high until 1920 (the years of Reconstruction, Jim Crow, Gilded Age and violent labor unrest, and the anarchists).</p>



<p>Then, the tide shifted, and a second wave of greater unity and prosperity began to gather strength. Contrary to expectations, World War I and the Great Depression did <em>not </em>produce a rise in political instability indicators. Instead, the country pulled together. The reforms introduced during the Progressive Era and clinched in the New Deal reduced inequality and strengthened the economic share of workers; during and after World War II, the country agreed on new tax policies and increased spending on roads and schools.</p>



<p>The 1950s were a golden age of worker progress and party cooperation; even in the 1960s and 1970s, despite serious racial conflicts, the country’s leaders were able to agree on remarkably far-reaching reforms to improve civil rights and environmental protection. However, the 1960s were a high point in our indicators of political resilience; in the 1970s and 1980s, things began to turn, and by the 1990s, a new wave of rising inequality and political divisions was well underway, exemplified by Newt Gingrich’s policies as speaker of the House. In the next two decades, the crisis indicators rose just as sharply as they had in the decades before the Civil War. It was not just that by the late 2010s, overall inequality was rising to the levels not seen since the Gilded Age; median wages in relation to GDP per capita also were falling to historically low levels.</p>



<p>Writing in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/463608a">Nature in 2010</a>, we pointed out that such trends were a reliable indicator of looming political instability and that they “look set to peak in the years around 2020.” In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ages-Discord-Peter-Turchin/dp/0996139540/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_1/140-4438334-0411838?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0996139540&amp;pd_rd_r=e31aa110-1e97-41b5-b8b9-59732b68e1b1&amp;pd_rd_w=NKvjs&amp;pd_rd_wg=QoYuR&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;pf_rd_r=53CDBB3DFVBED71T3PKV&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=53CDBB3DFVBED71T3PKV">Ages of Discord</a>, published early in 2016, we showed that America’s “political stress indicator” had turned up sharply in recent years and was on track to send us into the “Turbulent Twenties.”</p>

<hr>



<p>This year, the COVID-19 pandemic and the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police have delivered a double-barreled crisis to U.S. politics. America has reacted with a nationwide, months-long series of urban protests. But this explosion of protest is not just the result of this year’s events. The U.S. has weathered epidemics and racial protests before and produced legislation that made the country better as a result. What is different this decade is that these events are occurring at a time of extreme political polarization, after decades of falling worker’s share in national income, and with entrenched elite opposition to increased spending on public services. These trends have crippled the U.S. government’s ability to mount an effective response to the pandemic, hampered our ability to deliver an inclusive economic relief policy and exacerbated the tensions over racial injustice that boiled over in response to the video of Floyd’s death.</p>



<p>Is the U.S. likely headed for still greater protests and violence? In a word, yes. Inequality and polarization have not been this high since the nineteenth century. Democrats are certain that if Donald Trump is re-elected, American democracy will not survive. Republicans are equally certain that if Trump loses, radical socialists will seize the wealth of elites and distribute it to underserving poor and minorities, forever destroying the economy of the United States. Both sides are also convinced that the other side intends to change the democratic “rules of the game” in ways that will make it impossible for them to compete effectively in future elections. In such conditions, elections are not merely contests over policy preferences; they become existential battles for the future of the nation. Whichever party loses is likely to view the results as rigged and the outcome as intolerable.</p>

    <p>I have been working as a remote developer fulltime, for the last five years. Part-time/freelancing for at least ten years, over this time, I have collected several tips and tricks on how to become better at it and how to succeed and deliver results under this environment. I am writing this post to share some of these tricks, while this is a brief list. I am always testing these things. I thought it would be useful to do this one and periodically create a new one to share some updates.</p>

<p>If you are a TLDR reader, I am sharing here the list of the subtitles:</p>

<p>Now, if you find something interesting, stay with me and let’s learn something.</p>

<h2 id="secrets">Secrets</h2>

<p>From the easiest to the hardest.</p>

<h3 id="be-positive-and-open-minded">Be Positive and Open-minded</h3>

<p>This may be cliche, and not everyone is a positive person (and does not need to be). Still, is cool to have a positive attitude upfront a challenge or request; I am not saying you should be a yes man, I am saying that when you get a request, try to think about it as if is a challenge rather than a boring request,  or someone wanting to steal some of your time.</p>

<p>Be energetic and show what happens when you overcome some hard challenges, push the time to be more positive (for example). Being positive and expressing the success will increase yours and your team morale, and high team morale increases the chance of success.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-clean-setup-and-neat-workspace">Create a clean setup and neat workspace</h3>

<p>My workspace has a significant impact on my state of mind and even my productivity; back when I started working remotely, my office was a mess. I had a lot of objects on my table, and lots of them I had never used or even touched. That all ended-up on a day that I got a massive allergy that lasted for over two weeks. I noticed that was because of the dust in my office. It was out of control, and it would have been easier to clean it up weren’t for all the objects I had on my table.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/234049/92327865-0b314c80-f033-11ea-9727-baa8721d65a7.png" alt="Old office"></p>

<p>At that time, I also noticed I would work anywhere but in the office. After that day, I cleaned my office and removed everything from my table. In one week, I noticed a productivity-boosting and a much better sense of peace while working in my office. Then I started reading about all of that “clean-setup” movement, which immediately made sense. So I started the journey on how I could de more productive without working more hours, and I decided to go all-in. I stopped buying electronics that I rarely used and instead, I used the money to make my office simpler, cleaner, and more set to productivity.
I bought two ergonomic chairs, started using a single and bigger monitor instead of two. I got a mechanical arm that suspends it and therefore I do not occupy my table with supports. I switched my wired mouse and keyboard for wireless, added a plant, and even a fancy lamp to my office table.</p>

<p>Here is how it looks now.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/234049/93273814-36ccd900-f78f-11ea-844e-bad54f0d8dab.png" alt="New office"></p>

<p>Since these changes, I’ve noticed an even more significant increase in my productivity and well-being while working. I am still working out of the office sometimes, like from the garden of my house, from coffee shops or libraries, but now I feel there is no more productive place than my office in the quiet hours of the day. And I have tested myself to see how to return to the old mess environment. I placed a single page of paper on my table next to my keyboard, and at the end of that day, I felt exhausted. That day didn’t feel productive at all. It amazes me how much impact can a little mess do to my well-being nowadays, and how could I possibly work on such a chaotic environment in a close past.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/234049/92327958-bcd07d80-f033-11ea-86d5-4c8205b63a1f.jpg" alt="Garden"></p>

<h3 id="create-a-before-commit-secret-message">Create a “before commit” secret message</h3>

<p>Before doing any commit, my secret is that I will have my editor asking me, <code>Is it easy to change?</code>. This advice comes from several coding or software design books. The most important factory of a useful feature, project, software, method, and commit is that it needs to be changed easily. The idea for that message came from the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2AVGWiZ">Pragmatic programmer</a> (This is an outstanding book I recommend for any programmer at any level). As soon as I read it, I knew it would be a good idea to ask my self that question from time to time, once every commit seems to be the best I have for the moment.</p>

<p><img src="https://mateusfreira.github.io/images/commit-message.png" alt="Secret commit question"></p>

<h3 id="create-a-pull-request-checklist">Create a Pull request checklist</h3>

<p>In my daily notes, I have one checklist for each PR I will open for any project. This will help me making sure that PR will be good and will pass easily on review. I am also giving a grammar checking on Grammarly (I will talk about it in detail later in the Grammarly chapter). Check the variable names I have added in (You know how hard naming is), check the docs of the methods (So I make sure I’ve documented any critical information), check API docs (Changes in public APIs are usually rare, but when they happen you better remember to also update their docs). Smoke testing (of course, running the tests locally and seeing how they go). And finally, improve something I see that is bad (I try as much as I can not to rush on PR opening and to have this last step to improve something work for me like and “It won’t be possible to rush at this point”. The thing is, I usually find other small problem on the code in this step and consider it to be one of the most important)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># PR self review check list</span>
- <span>[</span> <span>]</span> Pass grammarly <span>in </span>the PR body
- <span>[</span> <span>]</span> Pass grammarly <span>in </span>the <span>test </span>spec

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="address-daily-meetings-like-a-diary">Address daily meetings like a diary</h3>

<p>Some people think that daily meetings are boring, but I think they can and should be fun and productive. I write my daily meeting notes every day as if I were keeping a diary, telling a short story about yesterday and this morning, as well as what I plan to do today and whether the plan for the week needs to change. I usually start working 4 hours before the next member of my team wakes up (I work from Brazil with a team located in the USA), so I write the notes of the daily meetings between 2 and 3 hours after starting work, which helps me to clarify how my day was yesterday, what should I keep doing, what should I avoid and what is blocking.</p>

<p>Also, the notes will give you a direct message to say at daily meetings, and I avoid starting the meeting by saying, “Let me remember what I did yesterday !!!” you will look professional, having the updates you need to provide at your fingertips. It also gives you a sense of how things are going over the days; you can look back at your daily notes and see if you’re making progress or not.</p>

<p>The time tracker is your ally when taking notes; this will help you not to forget any details, even if you take notes 3 days later, on a Monday. After a while, it will be natural, and you will not need to remember to do them, to start this habit, I recommend adding a task in your agenda 1 hour before the daily meeting to make notes this way once in the daily meeting begins you will be ready.</p>

<h3 id="tools-you-should-use">Tools you should use</h3>

<h4 id="1-grammarly">1. <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a></h4>

<p>Grammarly, for me, is one of the most essential tools for my day-to-day, whether as my text editor or email corrector. Writing for me is a superpower for remote workers and we have to make sure our text is reasonable; you do not need to proofread every single document you produce but it helps you not having any typos or structural problems. I do overuse Grammarly, and it has paid dividends for the last three years. Since I started my master’s degree, I had it verifying every single article and master thesis. Since then, I use to say it is the best investment I do every year.</p>

<h4 id="2-time-tracker">2. Time tracker</h4>

<p>Time tracking is a superpower that will enable you to see where you are putting your time on, even if your employer does not require it, I would recommend you to have one for many reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will where you are spending most of your time in.</li>
  <li>You can avoid overworking by knowing how many hours you worked on that day and not trusting your sense of “have I worked too much or too few?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Today I use <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> but in the past, while working as independet contractor I have used <a href="http://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>, and I track my activities in real time, without caring about all about details (Like I will not stop the clock if I go out to grap coffee or to read email), but I would recommend using any if them that you like using.</p>

<h4 id="3-skitch">3. <a href="https://evernote.com/products/skitch">Skitch</a></h4>

<p>One picture worths a thousand words, but it needs to be good, because sometimes you need to explain complex subjects to people that will not have the same context you have about the topic you are talking about. In that matter, Skitch is a great tool to take prints and show critical points and do short explanations. Check out the next image, where I was explaining a chart just as an example.</p>

<p><img width="1849" alt="Grafana_-_Nun-Db_Monitoring" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/234049/93271844-9d032d00-f78a-11ea-9e1c-922578623c36.png"></p>

<h4 id="4-obs-screen-recording">4. <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> (screen recording)</h4>

<p>As well as writing, showing information as video can be a superpower. Some subjects are much easier to demonstrate as a video than as a text. For example, simulating a bug or showing a problem needs to touch several services and multiple monitoring charts and sources.
Recording a good video showing how you find the bug, how you made sure it was fixed, or even explaining the process you have implemented can save you several paragraphs of text, and save you from having a PR rejected. Any complex new feature or bug fix, I would advise you to come with an excellent text in the PR, great code comments, great self-review showing the critical areas, and a good video explaining …</p></div></div>

    <article>
  
  <p>Sep 20, 2020</p>
  <p>I’ve recently read an article criticizing Rust, and, while it made a bunch of good points, I didn’t enjoy it — it was an easy to argue with piece.
In general, I feel that I can’t recommend an article criticizing Rust.
This is a shame — confronting drawbacks is important, and debunking low effort/miss informed attempts at critique sadly inoculates against actually good arguments.</p>
<p>So, here’s my attempt to argue <em>against</em> Rust:</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>Not All Programming is Systems Programming</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language.
It offers precise control over data layout and runtime behavior of the code, granting  you maximal performance and flexibility.
Unlike other systems programming languages, it also provides memory safety — buggy programs terminate in a well-defined manner, instead of unleashing (potentially security-sensitive) undefined behavior.</p>
<p>However, in many (most) cases, one doesn’t need ultimate performance or control over hardware resources.
For these situations, modern managed languages like Kotlin or Go offer decent speed, enviable
<a href="https://qconlondon.com/london-2017/system/files/presentation-slides/highperformancemanagedlanguages.pdf">time to performance</a>, and are memory safe by virtue of using a garbage collector for dynamic memory management.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Complexity</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Programmer’s time is valuable, and, if you pick Rust, expect to spend some of it on learning the ropes.
Rust community poured a lot of time into creating high-quality teaching materials, but the Rust language <em>is</em> big.
Even if a Rust implementation would provide value for you, you might not have resources to invest into growing the language expertise.</p>
<p>Rust’s price for improved control is the curse of choice:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Bar</span>         <span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Rc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span><span>&gt;</span>     <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Arc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Kotlin, you write <code>class Foo(val bar: Bar)</code>, and proceed with solving your business problem.
In Rust, there are choices to be made, some important enough to have dedicated syntax.</p>
<p>All this complexity is there for a reason — we don’t know how to create a simpler memory safe low-level language.
But not every task requires a low-level language to solve it.</p>

</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Compile Times</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Compile times are a multiplier for everything.
A program written in a slower to run but faster to compile programming language can be <em>faster</em> to run because the programmer will have more time to optimize!</p>
<p>Rust intentionally picked slow compilers in the <a href="https://research.swtch.com/generic">generics dilemma</a>.
This is not necessary the end of the world (the resulting runtime performance improvements are real), but it does mean that you’ll have to fight tooth and nail for reasonable build times in larger projects.</p>
<p><code>rustc</code> implements what is probably the most advanced <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/queries/incremental-compilation.html">incremental compilation</a> algorithm in production compilers, but this feels a bit like fighting with language compilation model.</p>
<p>Unlike C++, Rust build is not embarrassingly parallel; the amount of parallelism is limited by length of the critical path in the dependency graph.
If you have 40+ cores to compile, this shows.</p>
<p>Rust also lacks an analog for the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl">pimpl</a> idiom, which means that changing a crate requires recompiling (and not just relinking) all of its reverse dependencies.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Maturity</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Five years old, Rust is definitely a young language.
Even though its future looks bright, I will bet more money on “C will be around in ten years” than on “Rust will be around in ten years”
(See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy Effect</a>).
If you are writing software to last decades, you should seriously consider risks associated with picking new technologies.
(But keep in mind that picking Java over Cobol for banking software in 90s retrospectively turned out to be the right choice).</p>
<p>There’s only one complete implementation of Rust — the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/"><code>rustc</code></a> compiler.
The most advanced alternative implementation, <a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc"><code>mrustc</code></a>, purposefully omits many static safety checks.
<code>rustc</code> at the moment supports only a single production-ready backend — LLVM.
Hence, its support for CPU architectures is narrower than that of C, which has GCC implementation as well as a number of vendor specific proprietary compilers.</p>
<p>Finally, Rust lacks an official specification.
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/">The reference</a> is a work in progress, and does not yet document all the fine implementation details.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Alternatives</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>There are other languages besides Rust in systems programming space, notably, C, C++, and Ada.</p>
<p>Modern C++ provides <a href="https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/">tools</a> and <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines">guidelines</a> for improving safety.
There’s even a proposal for a Rust-like <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/docs/Lifetime.pdf">lifetimes</a> mechanism!
Unlike Rust, using these tools does not <em>guarantee</em> the absence of memory safety issues.
However, if you already maintain a large body of C++ code, it makes sense to check if following best practices and using <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">sanitizers</a> helps with security issues.
This is hard, but clearly is easier than rewriting in another language!</p>
<p>If you use C, you can use formal methods to <a href="https://sel4.systems/Info/FAQ/proof.pml">prove</a> the absence of undefined behaviors, or just <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html">exhaustively test</a> everything.</p>
<p>Ada is memory safe if you don’t use dynamic memory (never call <code>free</code>).</p>
<p>Rust is an interesting point on the cost/safety curve, but is far from the only one!</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Tooling</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Rust tooling is a bit of a hit and miss.
The baseline tooling, the compiler and the build system
(<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">cargo</a>), are often cited as best in class.</p>
<p>But, for example, some runtime-related tools (most notably, heap profiling) are just absent — it’s hard to reflect on the runtime of the program if there’s no runtime!
Additionally, while IDE support is decent, it is nowhere near the Java-level of reliability.
Automated complex refactors of multi-million line programs are not possible in Rust today.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Integration</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Whatever the Rust promise is, it’s a fact of life that today’s systems programming world speaks C, and is inhabited by C and C++.
Rust intentionally doesn’t try to mimic these languages — it doesn’t use C++-style classes or C ABI.</p>
<p>That means that integration between the worlds needs explicit bridges.
These are not seamless.
They are <code>unsafe</code>, not always completely zero-cost and need to be synchronized between the languages.
While the general promise of <a href="http://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/how-to-riir/">piece-wise integration</a> holds up and the <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">tooling</a> catches up, there is accidental complexity along the way.</p>
<p>One specific gotcha is that Cargo’s opinionated world view (which <em>is</em> a blessing for pure Rust projects) might make it harder to integrate with a bigger build system.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Performance</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>“Using LLVM” is not a universal solution to all performance problems.
While I am not aware of benchmarks comparing performance of C++ and Rust at scale, it’s not to hard to come up with a list of cases where Rust leaves some performance on the table relative to C++.</p>
<p>The biggest one is probably the fact that Rust’s move semantics is based on values (<code>memcpy</code> at the machine code level).
In contrast, C++ semantics uses special references you can steal data from (pointers at the machine code level).
In theory, compiler should be able to see through chain of copies; in practice it often doesn’t: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57077">#57077</a>.
A related problem is the absence of placement new — Rust sometimes need to copy bytes to/from the stack, while C++ can construct the thing in place.</p>
<p>Somewhat amusingly, Rust’s default ABI (which is not stable, to make it as efficient as possible) is sometimes worse than that of C: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26494#issuecomment-619506345">#26494</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, while in theory Rust code should be more efficient due to the significantly richer aliasing information, enabling aliasing-related optimizations triggers LLVM bugs and miscompilations: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878">#54878</a>.</p>
<p>But, to reiterate, these are cherry-picked examples, sometimes the field is tilted the other way.
For example, <code>std::unique_ptr</code> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHIkrotSwcc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1261">has a performance problem</a> which Rust’s <code>Box</code> lacks.</p>
<p>A potentially bigger issue is that Rust, with its definition time checked generics, is less expressive than C++.
So, some C++ <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Expression_templates">template tricks</a> for high performance are not expressible in Rust using a nice syntax.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Meaning of Unsafe</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>An idea which is even more core to Rust than ownership &amp; borrowing is perhaps that of <code>unsafe</code> boundary.
That, by delineating all dangerous operations behind <code>unsafe</code> blocks and functions and insisting on providing a safe higher-level interface to them, it is possible to create a system which is both</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>sound (non-<code>unsafe</code> code can’t cause undefined behavior),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and modular (different <code>unsafe</code> blocks can be checked separately).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>It’s pretty clear that the promise works out in practice: <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/trophy-case">fuzzing Rust code</a> unearths panics, not buffer overruns.</p>
<p>But the theoretical outlook is not as rosy.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, there’s no definition of Rust memory model, so it is impossible to formally check if a given unsafe block is valid or not.
There’s informal definition of “things rustc does or might rely on” and in in-progress <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">runtime verifier</a>, but the actual model is in flux.
So there might be some <code>unsafe</code> code somewhere which works OK in practice today, might be declared invalid tomorrow, and broken by a new compiler optimization next year.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, there’s also an observation that <code>unsafe</code> blocks are not, in fact, modular.
Sufficiently powerful <code>unsafe</code> blocks can, in effect, extend the language.
Two such extensions might be fine in isolation, but lead to undefined behavior if used simultaneously:
<a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2016/10/02/observational-equivalence-and-unsafe-code/">Observational equivalence and unsafe code</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Here are some thing I’ve deliberately omitted from the list:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Economics (“it’s harder to hire Rust programmers”) — I feel that the “maturity” section captures the essence of it which is not reducible to chicken and egg problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependencies (“stdlib is too small / everything has too many deps”) — given how good Cargo and the relevant parts of the language are, I personally don’t see this as a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic linking (“Rust should have stable ABI”) — I don’t think this is a strong argument. Monomorphization is pretty fundamentally incompatible with dynamic linking and there’s C ABI if you really need to. I do think that the situation here can be improved, <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/a-stable-modular-abi-for-rust/12347/10?u=matklad">but I don’t think that improvement needs to be Rust-specific</a>.</p>

</ul>

		<h3>Coney Island to The Bronx</h3>  
  		<p>"The Warriors" Movie: In 1979, the Street Gang the Coney Island Warriors made their Famous Trip - From Coney Island to Dyre Avenue/Eastchester in the Bronx - which would Change Their Lives Forever!. March 27, 2006, I Documented their Legendary Trip. "<em>It's still on, and we're going. Cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon to make sure. Cyrus don't want anybody packed or anybody flexing any muscle. So I gave him my word that the Warriors would uphold the truce. Everybody says that Cyrus is the one and only.

    		<h4>Number 4 (Muggers' Express) Woodlawn Station</h4>
  		<p><img src="http://www.stonegreasers.com/greaser/woodlawn1.jpg" alt="Woodlawn Subway Station and Cementary">You have to wonder if the producer of the Warriors wanted us to imagine where the location of the Conclave was really at, because it seems like the Woodlawn line (aka. Muggers' Express), Route 4, would have been a better choice since across the street from the Woodlawn Station is the famous Civil War era Woodlawn Cemetery? </p>
  
		<h3>Retracing The Warriors By Subway Lines</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Looking at the MTA Subway Map, and considering that the map in the movie showed them taking the Number 5 Train to Eastchester, I would have to assume after the Warriors were chased by the Turnbull A.C's, they rode the Number 5 down as far as Morris Park before they were detoured by the subway line fire. That way they could walk to the Pelham Parkway Station and pick up the Number 2 line. If they were able to make it down as far as the 149th Street and Grand Concourse Station, they would be able to run between the B, D, 2, 4, 5, and 6 Lines. I assume that is what the Director wanted us to think. </li>

<li>After watching the Directors-cut DVD, you find that the producer wanted you to come to your own conclusion to the various questions that you have about the famous trip. He gave you the map on where the Warriors arrived, and I think the rest is up to
  	 your imagination on where the following events took place.</li>


<li>The subway map in "The Warriors" movie, showed that the "D", "M", "Q", and "B" trains made the Brighton Beach Coney Island loop. Today, the "B" train stops at Brighton Beach and the "M" train travels on the Fourth Avenue/New Utrecht line. The "Q" Train is the only train that still travels to Coney Island via the Brighton line. The trains that travel to and from Coney Island are the D, F, N, and Q lines. The N and D Trains connect to the number 4, 5, and 6 Bronx bound trains at the Broadway-Lafayette Street Station. The F Train connects to those lines at the Canal Street Station. The Q and the N Trains are the only two trains making the Union Square - 14th Street connection, but the Q train is the only one that swings out towards Brighton Beach from the Stillwell's station like the 1970 Subway map in the movie. The N train also runs through Bay Ridge instead of running either the Culver or Brighton Lines. Like the Fox said to Rembrant, "Nobody can read these maps anyways!"</li>
<li>I could not find Cyrus, the Turnbull A.C's, the Rogues, or the rest of the gangs at either location, but I wanted everyone to know - The Gaylords were there! <a href="http://www.stonegreasers.com/greaser/lords_of_kilbourn.html">"Lords of Kilbourn"</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.scoutingny.com/the-new-york-city-filming-locations-of-the-warriors-ny-youve-changed/">New York City Filming Location for The Warriors</a> - Great website that takes you through the filming loacations in the movie.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When people talk about "algebraic reasoning", explanations fall flat because we neglect to first figure out kind of reasoning we're contrasting it against. When we write computer code using an operational model, we do <i>think about</i> what we write — so what manner of reasoning are we using? Can we give it a name? And can we explain why it seems so incompatible with the sort of reasoning that Lambda Man is always going on about?</p><p>I propose that the culture of programming at present may be divided into two approaches, explained by the following competing conceptions of the act of programming:</p><ol><li>An operational programmer <i>goes into</i> the computer;</li><li>An algebraic programmer remains <i>outside</i> the computer.</li></ol><p>We all have some need to shift between the two perspectives, but many of us become more entrenched in one or the other.</p><h2>Who calls the calls</h2><p>To start piecing together the orientation of each kind of programmer with respect to the computer, I'd like to look at a curious question of agency regarding function calls.</p><ul><li>When I write the expression "f x", I may describe my act of programming by saying that "we <b>apply</b> the function <i>f</i> to an argument <i>x</i>".</li><li>When the machine executes the program, I expect that "it will <b>evaluate</b> the function <i>f</i> at the argument <i>x</i>".</li></ul><p>But this separation between my action as an author and the machine's action as an automaton is only so distinct in the parlance of an algebraic programmer. If I were a Python programmer:</p><ul><li>When I write the expression "f(x)", I am "calling the function <i>f</i>".</li><li>When the machine executes my program, I expect that the Python interpreter will "call the function <i>f</i>".</li></ul><p>So who calls the function: me or Python? The answer is both; I <i>am</i> Python, and its actions are my actions, regardless of whether I am present and typing into a REPL or whether I have scripted them out ahead of time in a program that may run in my absence.</p><h2>One with the machine</h2><p>In either variety of programming, we sometimes put ourselves in the shoes of the machine to reason about the anticipated outcome of what we write. But how this imagination works depends on a great deal on whether we are outside or in. When we trace an operational program flow, the text of the program forms a space we can move within, and each variable is a statue that comes alive and begins to talk. Algebraic expression evaluation is a much more sterile and dull affair, and we remain seated in our desk chair. <i>Evaluating</i> is rewriting an expression in another form; it does not take us into different headspace from the one in which we wrote the code in the first place.</p><h2>Removing the lime from the coconut</h2><p>When an experienced inside-the-computer author begins in a programming language that forces us to approach programs from the outside, we can expect the question: If "I have an <code>IO String</code>", then "how do I get to the <code>String</code>"?</p><p>While others have already addressed this question in detail, what I want to draw attention to here is that the misunderstanding originates from trying to apply the <i>inside</i> conceptual mapping to a programming model that is strongly <i>outside</i>. An <code>IO String</code> is a process that produces a <code>String</code> result. So if I <i>were</i> standing inside a Haskell program, holding such a thing in my hands, it stands to reason that I could run the process and get the string. But we do not <i>have</i> such values because we do not <i>go</i> inside to <i>get</i> anything. We remain at the text editor, writing definitions. One such definition might be for a process which consists of the machine 1. first running some <code>IO String</code> process; and then 2. doing some other action with the resulting string.</p><p>This is not an unfamiliar task for a JavaScript programmer, who knows that one cannot get the value from a Promise — all we can do is set up plans for what to do once the Promise is fulfilled. A JavaScript programmer, although inside of the computer, is outside of the event loop. When my callbacks are roused, I do my work, then I fall back sleep to await another gig.</p><h2>What you got in that room</h2><p>The term "global variable" reveals something interesting about our mental picture. Such a variable does not span the globe, nor even a local network. To what scope does a word so grand as "global" refer? Humbly, the scope of a process. Or perhaps an entire machine, if I am a kernel developer. When I code operationally, I reside in a tiny world — the landmasses on my little blue marble are the memory segments to which I have access.</p><p>When I switched from operational to algebraic programming, first I learned that there are no global variables, then that terminology began to fade from consciousness altogether. As a Haskell programmer, I'm not in a little globe on the desk; I live on the Earth and I type definitions. Among those definitions may be a datatype that represents the state of a process, true. But this datatype is not my world, and the vast majority definitions I write in service of the program will not be functions of it.</p><p>Private "member variables" in a Java class can only be accessed <i>from within</i> the class. Perhaps the preposition can be taken to refer somewhat literally to the lexical scope of the class definition — that is, the code that is written between the opening and closing braces. But do we employ a deeper container metaphor here? Maybe this one is just me, but I see the <i>instance</i> as a <i>room</i>, and the members as the stuff I have at my disposal when I'm working inside that room.</p><p>In Haskell we also have lexical scoping, as well as a notion of modules with definitions that are either exported or not exported, which for many purposes mirrors the public/private field distinction. But I do not have the experience of mentally going inside a module in the same sense as reasoning inside of a Java instance. I believe it is Java's coupling of modules with mutable state that encourages this spacial reasoning.</p><h2>Getting your steps in</h2><p>When you use a step debugger, you actually <i>step into</i> the program! This is true regardless of whether you are using the debugging facilities of Python or Haskell. Though the code may be algebraic, when we use a step debugger we are always looking at it from an operational perspective.</p><h2>Working on documents</h2><p>Lately I like to refer to my role as "author" more than "programmer" — regardless of whether the file extension is ".md" or ".hs". It's because I don't feel like I work inside a computer anymore. I work sitting <i>at</i> a computer, I write <i>about</i> programs, and — although much of what I write can be executed by a machine — I do not often become lost within, because I remain safely on the outside.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>(Update: I didn’t mention this concerned <strong>wired</strong> headphones).</p>
<p>I aggressively disagree with any computer design decisions that detract from ergonomics or health, and nowhere does this continue to remain bafflingly true than audio output. Strap in, I’m about to get a bit ranty!</p>
<p>If we encounter an unwanted audio signal emanating from our computers, especially an uncomfortably-loud one over headphones, we should <em>immediately</em> be able to terminate it. No exceptions. If there is any latency <em>whatsoever</em> between us hitting a mute button and the audio not cutting out, the hardware or software has failed. Crypton Future Media’s Hatsune Miku wouldn’t tolerate latency with her headphones, and neither should we.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/miku-headphones@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/miku-headphones@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/miku-headphones@2x.jpg 2x" alt=""></p>
<p>I was in a conference call last Friday where I’d adjusted the volume up to compensate for the client’s quiet microphone, only to be audibly shot in the ears by an auto-playing video on a website. There is a <em>lot</em> of problematic stuff to unpack there, much of which is not the fault of the audio hardware or OS. But shocked in the moment, I hit the mute button on my MacBook Pro Touchbar, and it took a solid two seconds for it to register. My ears were ringing throughout the whole call. <em>This is unacceptable.</em></p>
<p>Well-engineered mute buttons on keyboards shouldn’t need to go to software, they should immediately send a signal to the motherboard’s DAC—ideally on a separate wire or connection—to say <em>terminate this signal</em>. Then it’s less of a concern if it takes the OS a few seconds to react to the change, because our ears have been spared.</p>
<p id="just-ackchyually">The <em>just ackchyually</em> crowd would don their Captain Obvious capes and brightly-coloured underwear to proclaim that people could <em>just</em> unplug their headphones, or rip them off ones head when suddenly inundated with loud audio. Sure, and if you start getting electric shocks from your keyboard you could <em>just</em> use an external one, bro. Or if you get your hand caught in a mixer, <em>just</em> use your other hand, that’s why you have two of them. There are so many reasons why this dismissive attitude is specious, but even if it weren’t, it would still take more physical effort <em>than a button</em>. And if a mute button doesn’t fulfill the function for which it’s labelled and designed, what’s the point of it? But then, these people know all that, they’re just being obtuse.</p>
<p>We have valid privacy arguments advocating for physical Wi-Fi, camera, and microphone buttons; I’d say audio should be voiced in these discussions too. They should be heard. Sound ideas should be reverberated. Miku.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a roughly ten year old Brother HL-5370DW printer on the shelf next to me.
This printer is mostly used by my wife to print sewing patterns. When I was
studying computer science, I sometimes printed documents I've written for
proofreading. I often was able to find typos that I didn't see on the screen
even after proofreading the document two or three times. However, I didn't
bother to print out my bachelor thesis. Printing 120 pages just for proofreading
just seemed a waste to me. I did my proofreading on the screen extra carefully,
and nobody complained about typos. (Which doesn't mean that there were none.)</p>
<p>Having finished my studies, I hardly ever print out documents. However, I still
prefer to read long texts on paper rather than on the screen. Therefore I often
buy technical books as paperbacks or hardcovers rather than ebooks. And if I buy
an ebook with demanding content, I print out those sections for offline reading.</p>
<p>Having switched to OpenBSD for my private computing shifted my reading habits
more towards manpages. When I need to figure out how something works on
OpenBSD, <code>apropos(1)</code> beats Google as a starting point in many cases. Some
manpages are really long, for example <code>ksh(1)</code>. I have a book on the Korn Shell
in my basement, which covers <code>ksh93</code>.  However, there are some differences
between <code>ksh93</code> and OpenBSD's <code>pdksh</code>. So reading the manpage not only gives me
more accurate information, but also <em>less</em> to read.</p>
<p>So why not printing out the manpage <code>ksh(1)</code>? I can do so even nicely formatted
using PostScript:</p>
<pre><code>$ man -T ps -O paper=a4 ksh &gt;ksh.1.ps
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>ksh.1.ps</code> can be read with <code>zathura(1)</code>, given that the package
<code>zathura-ps</code> is installed:</p>
<pre><code># pkg_add zathura zathura-ps
$ zathura ksh.1.ps
</code></pre>
<p>But why using PostScript and not PDF like anybody else for the last twenty five
years? Because PostScript is the least common denominator and, thus, supported
out of the box by OpenBSD. (For fancier printing options, check out <code>cups</code>, but
I'd like to keep it minimalistic for the moment.)</p>

<p>I figured out how to configure my printer by reading the section <em>The lpd
Printing Daemon</em> in the 16th chapter of <a href="https://nostarch.com/obenbsd2e">Absolute OpenBSD (2nd
Edition)</a> (p. 306-307) by <a href="https://mwl.io/">Michael W
Lucas</a>. This is how I applied the configuration to my local
setup.</p>
<p>First, I created the file <code>/etc/printcap</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>lp|brother:\
    :sh=:\
    :rm=192.168.178.52:\
    :sd=/var/spool/output/brother:\
    :lf=/var/log/lpd-errs:\
    :rp=brother
</code></pre>
<p>There must be a newline at the end of the file. The line breaks are escaped
using backslashes, except for the last line. The options are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line defines two names for my printer: <code>lp</code>, which should always be
  there, and <code>brother</code>, which is my arbitrary name for the printer.</li>
<li>The second line (<code>sh</code>) defines that no <em>burst page</em> (summarizing the last
  print job on a special page) should be printed.</li>
<li>The third line (<code>rm</code>) refers to the printer on the network. My FritzBox always
  gives the same IP to my printer. It's also possible to use the printer's
  hostname.</li>
<li>The fourth line (<code>sd</code>) defines the spooler directory for this printer. Print
  jobs are written into that directory.</li>
<li>The fifth line (<code>lf</code>) defines a log file for error messages, which you hopefully
  never need to check.</li>
<li>The sixth line (<code>rp</code>) defines the remote printer name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, the spooler directory needs to be created. It must be owned by the user
<code>root</code> and the group <code>daemon</code>. Regular users need write access to this directory
in order to print documents:</p>
<pre><code># mkdir /var/spool/output/brother
# chown -R root:daemon /var/spool/output/brother
# chmod 770 /var/spool/output/brother
</code></pre>
<p>Now the printer daemon <code>lpd</code> needs to be activated. To do so on system startup,
add the following line to <code>/etc/rc.conf/local</code>:</p>
<pre><code>lpd_flags=""
</code></pre>
<p>Then start the service:</p>
<pre><code># /etc/rc.d/lpd restart
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update (2020-09-21)</strong>: As one reader on
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24535357#24538879">Hacker News</a> pointed
out, the last two steps can be performed using <code>rcctl(8)</code>:</p>
<pre><code># rcctl enable lpd
# rcctl restart lpd
</code></pre>
<p>The manpage says that <code>rcctl(8)</code> was introduced in OpenBSD 5.7 back in 2015.
<em>Absolute OpenBSD (2nd Edition)</em> is from 2013 and, thus, older than that. (At
the time of this writing, I'm using Version 6.7.)</p>
<p>Another reader pointed out that setting the access rights to <code>777</code> is a bad
practice. That's true, and I actually got the reasoning behind this wrong: I
thought any user must be able to write to the spooler, because any user is
supposed to print. However, it's <code>lpd</code> that is writing to the spooler, which of
course runs under the <code>daemon</code> group. Therefore, the access rights for
<code>/var/spool/output/brother</code> should be set to <code>770</code>, not to <code>777</code> (as corrected
above).</p>

<p>Now the printer is ready to accept jobs. In order to print the PostScript file
generated before, just run <code>lpr</code> on the file:</p>
<pre><code>$ lpr ksh.1.ps
</code></pre>
<p>It's also possible to send the PostScript output directly to the printer (this
is Unix, after all), if no preview is needed:</p>
<pre><code>$ man -T ps -O paper=a4 ksh | lpr
</code></pre>
<p>Printing plain text files behaved strange on my setup, but could to using the
<code>pr</code> formatter with <code>lpr</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ lpr -p plain.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, I also convert plain text files to PostScript, which looks quite nice
on paper. I use <code>enscript(1)</code> for this task:</p>
<pre><code># pkg_add enscript
$ enscript plain.txt -o plain.ps
$ lpr plain.ps
</code></pre>
<p>PDFs can also be converted to PostScript using <code>pdf2ps(1)</code>, which comes with
GhostScript, i.e. the <code>ghostscript</code> package:</p>
<pre><code>$ pdf2ps document.pdf document.ps
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't work with all PDFs. But for the time being, I have
enough manpages to read. Printing PostScript works extremely fast, by the way.
When I press return at the end of a <code>lpr</code> command, I can see the status LED on
my printer start blinking almost immediately.</p></div></div>]]>

September 20, 2020 | https://dan.langille.org/2020/09/10/tarsnap-cleaning-up-old-backups/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dan.langille.org/2020/09/10/tarsnap-cleaning-up-old-backups/">archive.org</a>

			<div>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a> for my critical data. Case in point, I use it to backup my Bacula database dump. I use Bacula to backup my hosts. The database in question keeps track of what was backed up, from what host, the file size, checksum, where that backup is now, and many other items. Losing this data is annoying but not a disaster. It can be recreated from the backup volumes, but that is time consuming. As it is, the file is dumped daily, and rsynced to multiple locations.</p>
<p>I also backup that database daily via <span>tarsnap</span>. I’ve been doing this since at least 2015-10-09.</p>
<p>The uncompressed dump of this PostgreSQL database is now about 117G. </p>
<pre># ls -l bacula.dump 
-rw-r-----  1 10839  10839  125497737071 Sep  8 03:29 bacula.dump
</pre>
<p>Let’s look at recent usage by that host:</p>
<div id="attachment_6180"><p><a href="https://dan.langille.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tarsnap-usage.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6180" loading="lazy" src="https://dan.langille.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tarsnap-usage-634x1024.png" alt="tarsnap recent usaage" width="634" height="1024" srcset="https://dan.langille.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tarsnap-usage-634x1024.png 634w, https://dan.langille.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tarsnap-usage-186x300.png 186w, https://dan.langille.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tarsnap-usage.png 747w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6180">tarsnap recent usaage</p></div>
<p>The latest <span>Daily storage</span> value is 96G.</p>
<p>Using this command, I obtained a list of the archives stored:</p>
<pre>tarsnap --list-archives -vv &gt; ~/tarsnap-knew-archive-list
</pre>
<p>See <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/man-tarsnap.1.html">man 1 tarsnap</a></p>
<p>I found 1751 archives, the oldest one was created on 2015-10-08 19:01:17.</p>
<p>This is a great example of <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/deduplication-examples.html">Tarsnap deduplication and compression</a>.  I have 5 years of backups taking up only 96G and the latest backup is 113G.</p>
<p>By comparison, my other <span>tarsnap</span> backups take up this amount of space:</p>
<hr>

</tbody></table>
<hr>
<p>I’m going to trim down the dump archives, for sure.</p>
<p>I’m curious about that bacula configuration archive.  The Bacula configuration is only about 600K:</p>
<pre>$ cd /usr/local/etc/bacula
$ sudo du -ch .
608K	.
608K	total
$ </pre>
<p>Checking the archive list for that machine, I find 6 database backups from early October 2015.</p>
<p>Let’s delete those backups first. The names of those archives are:</p>
<pre title="">bacula.int.BaculaDatabase.2015-10-02

<p>Let’s delete one:</p>

<p>I won’t see the change in the ‘Recent account usage by machine’ page because that ‘updates shortly after midnight UTC’.  I’ll come back tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I think I can delete all my old Bacula database backups from before 2020.  For fun, I will keep each backup from 01-01, and the oldest backup.</p>

    <p>As an immigrant on an H1B, you have exactly 60 days to find a new job when you are laid-off. This is a very short window of time to explore and land any job, let alone a job that matches your skills and interests. I found myself in this situation along with many others when Uber announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262337/uber-layoff-3000-employees-covid-19-coronavirus">layoffs</a> earlier this year. The following is a recollection of some things that worked well for me during my eventually successful job hunt.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#always-be-prepping">Always be Prepping</a></li>
<li><a href="#reach-out-to-everyone">Reaching Out</a></li>
<li><a href="#interview-preparation">Interview Preparation</a></li>
<li><a href="#closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="always-be-prepping">Always be prepping</h3>
<p>Coding interviews are hard to crack if you haven't been prepping, so I was lucky that I had been spending roughly 3-4 hours every week on <a href="http://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a>, from about 2 months before the layoff rumours broke. I was lucky that</p>
<ul>
<li>I knew that I wanted to change jobs in any case and</li>
<li>Rumours of layoffs broke approximately a month before the actual layoffs happened, giving me more lead time to prepare and send out emails to recruiters and friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever there's an economic downturn, I think it's critical to be acutely aware of what's happening at the company and start preparing for job interviews right away.</p>
<h3 id="reach-out-to-everyone">Reach out to everyone</h3>
<p>One of the hardest things to do when you are laid off is to write to your friends and family seeking help. But if there's ever a time to swallow your pride, then this is it. I reached out to everyone I knew, and told them plainly about my situation, and asked to be recommended to specific roles at their companies, or to tell their friends who may be hiring. I am extremely grateful to the help I got from my network, and the kind messages that I received. So many friends wrote to make sure I was okay, and kept checking in throughout the interview process, and they all have my immense gratitude.</p>
<p>It is tempting to just apply on the careers page when you find relevant roles at a company instead of spending time on finding connections and reaching out to them, but in my experience, it was very much worth it. Response times from recruiters was roughly 1-2 days when I was referred by an employee, whereas applying on the careers page was a hit or miss. One BigCo. took 40 days to respond, while some smaller companies were much quicker (3-4 days).</p>
<h4 id="the-process">The Process</h4>
<p>In terms of companies, cast a wide net because you absolutely need <em>a</em> job before a deadline. The steps are the obvious ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a list of companies</li>
<li>For each company, compile a list of open job profiles that are relevant.</li>
<li>Email/Text a connection at the company, or apply on the careers page if all else fails.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I reached out to an initial list of 10 companies or so on the day news of the layoffs broke. This worked well because there's at least a week's time before you speak to a hiring manager or interviewer from when you reach out, so there's ample time to prepare.</p>
<p>What companies to reach out to? In my case, it was the usual suspects (FAANG), and then some domain specific ones such as autonomous vehicle companies. The two most common roles that I applied to were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> - This is a hybrid role with ML + Software Engineering skills needed, and job roles usually talk about some specific domain such as recommendation systems, or in the case of autonomous vehicles, things such as perception or object detection. I typically looked for some mention of Computer Vision, NLP and deep learning.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning Infra Engineer</strong> - This role tends to be more on the software systems side, and deals with the infra for training and serving ML models for production workloads.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interview-preparation">Interview Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#an-initial-screen-with-the-hiring-manager">Hiring Manager Screen</a></li>
<li><a href="#coding-interviews-phone--onsite">Coding Interviews</a></li>
<li><a href="#machine-learning-interviews">Machine Learning Interviews</a></li>
<li><a href="#behavioral-interviews">Behavioral Interviews</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Interviewing for ML specific roles typically involves a few different kinds of interviews, each of which needs specific preparation. I'm outlining the most common ones I saw below:</p>
<h3 id="an-initial-screen-with-the-hiring-manager">An initial screen with the hiring manager</h3>
<p>Companies that do general interviews (Google / Facebook) don't have this step, but most others do. I personally like this, because it means that you are interviewing for a specific position in a specific team, and there's a high level of engagement from the beginning. Most of these calls were about getting to know me, and making sure I have relevant work experience, while some of them also were rapid fire technical questions. The latter ones were rare, and I encountered them when the manager wasn't certain that I was the right person for the job. In my experience, the introduction is the most important part of this interview (<strong>Tell me about yourself</strong>), and it helps to have prepared intros for each type of role that you are applying to. The idea is to tailor your story to highlight aspects of your work experience that are relevant to the job role. The next most important question is "<strong>What would you like to do in your next role?</strong>". Again, it helps immensely to be prepared to answer this question, and ideally, in a way so that there's reasonable overlap between your answer and what the role offers. Being able to answer this question also provides clarity to the job search process. For example, a consistent theme for me was to be (a) in an impactful / critical role for the company and (b) continue to work with the latest in ML.</p>
<p>Writing and rehearsing your stories often seems unimportant when compared to more tangible preparation steps such as spending time on leetcode, but I believe that it was critical, because it sets the tone and gives you confidence that you have done this in the past, and done it well, and there's no reason for the interviewer to doubt your abilities.</p>
<h3 id="coding-interviews-phone--onsite">Coding Interviews (Phone / Onsite)</h3>
<p>These are the standard leetcode style coding interviews, done using coderpad, or some similar service. The template for these is consistent across all companies, and involves 1 or 2 coding questions (or 1 question with follow-ups) that you are expected to implement and test. Some tips that were helpful for me preparation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get a premium subscription with leetcode</strong> - It is nice to be able to filter by companies and have access to the entire question bank, and it is good karma. The service is valuable and the creators should be compensated.</li>
<li><strong>Simulate the interview setting as much as possible</strong> - For example, I would set aside a 3 hour block of time for leetcode, shut myself in a room, and do 4 questions, 45 minutes each. If you are unable to solve a question in 45 minutes, you still move on to the next one. No extensions or looking at the solution. Think of it like moving on to the next interviewer. After the 3 hour session is done, go back to the questions as needed, either to look at solutions or to understand them better. A question is <code>Done</code> when your solution passes all the tests on leetcode and is <code>Accepted</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Talk out loud</strong> - This is big. Again, assuming that you are in an actual interview, talk out loud about the process you are using during these practice sessions. Talking out loud helps massively because you are forced to put your current train of thought into words, and it is often evident when a solution isn't justifiable.</li>
<li><strong>How to pick questions?</strong> - I filtered for questions that were tagged <code>Hard</code>, and then picked at random. No filter for company, or problem type. I went from doing all Mediums to a mix of Mediums and Hard to all Hards over a span of 4-5 weeks.</li>
<li><strong>How many questions to do?</strong> - In the first 2-3 weeks of my prep, I was doing 4 questions on one of the weekend days, and once I had more time post the lay-off news, it was 4 questions every 3 days or so. Overall, my stats look so:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://bharathpbhat.github.io/assets/images/leetcode_xp.png" alt="Leetcode stats"></p>
<h3 id="machine-learning-interviews">Machine Learning Interviews</h3>
<p>These typically come in two flavors:</p>
<h4 id="concepts--basics">Concepts / Basics</h4>
<p>These are kind of like rapid fire questions where the interviewer will quiz you about ML basics. Some questions that I recall right now, to give a flavor of things:</p>
<pre><code>- What are some unsupervised learning methods?
- What is underfitting / overfitting?
- What is batch normalization? What's the motivation behind it?
- What is dropout? 
- What optimizers have you used? And typically some follow-up like, why does momentum make sense?
- What are some object detection techniques / papers that you are familiar with? (Computer Vision specific)
- What are decision trees? 
- How does logistic regression work?
- How do you train a linear regression model?
- What are some loss functions that you are familiar with?
- Why does Cross Entropy loss make sense?
- What are residual networks?
</code></pre>
<p>These are usually follow up questions where the interviewer will try to dig deeper into these concepts, often picking on some portion of the initial answer.</p>
<p>I did a lot of reading, and then some writing with a pen and paper for this part of the interview. If I am already somewhat/fairly familiar with a topic, like say, object detection, then my process was:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Write</strong> from memory a summary of what I remember about the topic</li>
<li>Note down <strong>questions</strong> for the parts that I am not clear about</li>
<li><strong>Read</strong> about the topic, and fill in whatever I missed on first go.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I don't remember much about a topic at all, like say, multi-armed bandits, then I would do step (3) first, and then do steps (1) and (2) a few days later, and eventually repeating step (3) as needed.</p>
<p>It helps to start with a list of topics that you want do this for. This list will grow as you remember more topics or expand the list of companies you are interviewing at. For reference, the list of topics I looked at is <a href="https://bharathpbhat.github.io/assets/files/index_card.pdf">here</a>, and a sample of the handwritten notes I made is here, for <a href="https://bharathpbhat.github.io/assets/files/rec_sys.pdf">recommendation systems</a>.</p>
<h4 id="ml-system-design">ML System Design</h4>
<p>This is my favorite interview, and corresponds neatly to skills used day to day as a ML practitioner. These are typically open ended interviews where the candidate is expected to design a product with some ML at its core. For example, things like:</p>
<pre><code>- Let's build a model that ranks photos in your photo library based on quality.
- How would you build a model that identifies pedestrians from drone imagery?
- Let's build a model that can does face detection for a user's photo library.
- How do you build a model that automatically picks out …</code></pre></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>This is a follow-up to my previous post: <a href="https://blog.gingerlime.com/2020/hey-com-is-onto-something-with-its-tracking-pixel-blocker/">hey.com is onto something with its tracking-pixel blocker</a>. I mentioned contacting Backblaze about their email tracking there. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="630" height="396" src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/Screenshot-2020-06-21-at-08.17.12.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/Screenshot-2020-06-21-at-08.17.12.png 630w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/Screenshot-2020-06-21-at-08.17.12-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"></figure></div>



<p>I didn’t think too much of it at the time, and honestly (or naively?) was expecting some kind of a “Oh, yes, you’re right, there’s no need to track those emails”… But it didn’t unfold in quite the same way.</p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>This is my own interpretation, obviously. Backblaze seems to think that tracking emails is totally fine, even under the GDPR. They’re not going to stop doing it until further notice.</p>



<h2>Blow by blow details</h2>



<p>Rather than describing the conversation, I think for the sake of transparency it’s easier to just quote the entire thread. So here goes, in chronological order… I removed names and identifying details to protect the privacy of the people involved, but the text was otherwise left exactly as-is. Some of the interaction is fairly mundane, but you can skip to the end to see how it was resolved (or rather, not resolved).</p>



<h2>Initial conversations with Backblaze support</h2>



<figure><div>Jun 20, 2020<p>Hi Backblaze,</p><p>I started forwarding my emails to hey.com and they spotted the use of tracking pixels on your emails. I (and I believe many other customers, especially in Europe) would appreciate not being tracked without explicit consent (and I didn’t give such consent).</p><p>Respectfully,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 21, 2020<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for writing in. We do use Sendgrid to send system emails, and only collect if an email was delivered, opened, and how many times it was opened. We do not gather other information beyond that.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the terms can be found when you click on the link below and by using the service agree to our terms:<br>–&nbsp;<a href="http://www.backblaze.com/terms.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">http://www.backblaze.com/terms.html</a></p><p>All the best,<br>A.<br>Support Technician</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 21, 2020<p>Hi A.,</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me. Your terms page doesn’t actually say anything about tracking my email opens etc. Or at least I couldn’t find anything.</p><p>Regardless, I don’t believe this is permissible without explicit consent under the GDPR. I also don’t quite understand why you would even want to track those alert emails?</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 22, 2020<p>Hi A.,</p><p>Perhaps the timestamps on their own aren’t considered personal data, but combined with my email address, IP, browser info etc, I’m pretty sure falls under personal data as defined by the GDPR. According to two articles I was able to find, this kind of tracking isn’t permissible by GDPR and the e-Privacy directive without explicit consent, which was not requested, nor given by me.</p><p><a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ac233fd4-cd49-45a7-9494-6085512c0312" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ac233fd4-cd49-45a7-9494-6085512c0312</a><br><a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/gdpr-email-tracking" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/gdpr-email-tracking</a></p><p>The links you provided so far do not appear to address this issue. Would appreciate if you could look into this more seriously.</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 23, 2020<p>Hello Yoav,</p><p>I asked my Compliance organization to review your concerns. They noted that much of the literature around this topic deals with Marketing Emails, which you can opt-out of at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For Service Emails, which the message in question is, the rules are less clear and they will contact our GDPR attorney in the EU for clarification. That said, I believe you have four choices:<br>1) You may alter the settings on your email system to receive such emails as text, this will remove all tracking,<br>2) You can discontinue using the Backblaze service and delete your Backblaze account if you remain an active customer we will continue to send you Service emails per our Terms,<br>3) You can wait to see what our GDPR attorney says, or<br>4) You may file a complaint with the GDPR authorities in your jurisdiction.</p><p>All the best,<br>A.<br>Support Technician</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 23, 2020<p>Hi A.,</p><p>Happy to wait and hear from your GDPR attorneys.</p><p>I agree that most resources talk about marketing emails, because those are the most prevalent and most common use-case of B2C and B2B emails these days. Transactional emails are generally considered legitimate use, and in this case, I explicitly asked for those emails. So there’s no question there about *sending* these emails. As far as *tracking* how I interacted with the email, as well as further personal data like IP address, device/browser info etc (that this type of tracking typically involves), and storing this info on Sendgrid’s servers, I’m pretty confident that this isn’t considered legitimate without informed and explicit consent under the GDPR and the ePrivacy directives. hey.com seem also quite confident that this is illegal (although I don’t take legal advice from them).</p><p>But besides that, I’m just curious to understand why Backblaze even cares to track those emails? what insights do you gain from knowing that X% of those emails were opened? (especially given that those stats are hugely inaccurate and some email clients block them anyway?). Wouldn’t it be easier to do the right thing here, respect your customers privacy, and stop tracking those emails? (or if you do gain important insights, explicitly and clearly ask for consent?)</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p><p>p.s. I also believe the same rules apply to tracking of marketing emails, even if someone explicitly gives consent to *receive* those, it does not automatically mean that they give consent to being tracked, and the privacy implications of such tracking.</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 24, 2020<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p><p>I have referred the matter to the legal department and will need to close this ticket. Any further communication will come from <a href="mailto:legal@backblaze.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">legal@backblaze.com</a>.</p><p>All the best,<br>A.<br>Support Technician</p></div></figure>



<h2>A month passes…</h2>



<p>I was losing my patience, so sent another message to Backblaze.</p>



<figure><div>Jul 25, 2020<p>This is a follow-up to your previous request #ZZZZZZZ “email tracking”</p><p>Hi A.,It’s been a month now, and I still haven’t heard back. Would appreciate if someone can get back to me on this.</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<div><div>
<figure><div>Jul 25, 2020<p>Hi Yoav,</p><p>Thank you for reaching out regarding this issue. Apologies for any delay. I’m sorry to say but further communication will need to go through <a href="mailto:legal@backblaze.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">legal@backblaze.com</a>.</p><p>Please reach out to that email for additional information.<br>M.<br>Support Technician</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jul 26, 2020<p>Hi M.,</p><p>Yes, but it’s been a month, and I believe that under GDPR I can typically expect an answer within a month? see https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/time-limits-for-responding-to-data-protection-rights-requests/</p><p>Looking forward to hearing back from whichever team/person that can handle my enquiry.</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<h2>Legal department steps in</h2>



<figure><div>Jul 31, 2020<p>Hi Yoav,</p><p>Thank you for following up on this matter. We take data privacy matters very seriously at Backblaze, Inc. We have reviewed your concerns and understand your sensitivity regarding the use of tracking technology on emails. In this particular case, we believe there is an exception allowed for doing so for a valid business purpose. There are two reasons we believe this is necessary.</p><p>The first reason is to accurately measure the reach and usefulness of our service email messages to our customers. Service emails communicate important information to the customer and if they are not being received or opened, valuable information is being missed. For example, the customer’s data we are storing could be at risk of being deleted, or their account could be in peril of being compromised. We use the tracking technology to provide an aggregated measure of this information versus using more invasive technologies such as user surveys or onscreen popups. Over the years we have sent many service emails and we have a full understanding as to the delivery and open rates of our service emails. As such, any anomalies are easily detected and can be acted upon to improve how well we communicate with our customers.</p><p>The second reason is for forensic purposes to respond to questions from customers and defend ourselves as needed. For example, we send multiple service emails to a customer whose subscription is expiring, as once it does expire, we will close their account and delete the data we are storing for them. From time-to-time an ex-customer will want their data and claim we did not notify them that their account was expiring. The tracking technology allows us to show what messages we have sent and what messages the customer received and opened. While not perfect, it has helped us defend ourselves in the past. There is no reasonable replacement for using the tracking technology in such cases. By the way, the same technology also allows us to prove the customer right in many cases, so it delivers value and protects both us and the customer at the same time.</p><p>Thank you for being a valued customer.</p><p>Best regards,<br>T.<br>Legal Department</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Aug 1, 2020<p>Hi T.,</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me and explaining your reasoning in detail.</p><p>I have to admit, it sounds a bit like a husband spying on their wife “because they love her” to some extent. I don’t feel like these are valid reasons for blanket tracking of ALL emails across all customers, which seems to be the case at Backblaze. As far as I can tell, all Backblaze emails are tracking me and all other customers, from newsletters, across minor service notifications all the way to billing and other messages. Not all messages are the same, but they are all tracked in the same way as far as I can tell. Furthermore, not only there is no informed consent for this tracking, there’s actually no opt-out mechanism either. As a customer, I cannot tell you that I want your service emails, but I don’t want them tracking me. I don’t believe this meets the spirit nor the letter of the GDPR.</p><p>The first example does not at all sound like a legitimate reason to me, and I doubt the data protection authorities will accept it as legitimate either. Especially when it applies to all emails, including minor notifications, newsletters and other marketing materials. What you’re describing is that you’re compromising the privacy of your customers for your own internal reasons for marketing purposes. And as I mentioned before, with no informed consent, nor opt-out options. But besides that, given …</p></div></figure></div></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div></div>

                    <p>More and more enterprises have begun or have already implemented a data lake strategy based on some of the work we did a couple of years ago. If you want to take a moment to review - you can find those posts below <a href="https://blog.min.io/modern-data-lake-with-minio-part-1/">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.min.io/modern-data-lake-with-minio-part-2/">here</a>. </p><h2 id="objective">Objective</h2><p>In this article, I am going to explain a mechanism to turbocharge the use of MinIO. Nothing changes as far as MinIO is concerned, the optimization will be on the underlying storage of our data. We are going to choose one of the latest formats to improve agility manifoldly. We are going to show the ways by which your data lake data can travel across systems without experiencing any "conversion" time. </p><h2 id="apache-arrow">Apache Arrow</h2><p>I believe understanding this article needs some basic concepts of<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/"> </a>how applications like Spark works. Let me explain it in simple terms.</p><p>Imagine you got a nice job at a location different from where you live currently and you want to relocate, as the new company demands it and pays for it. You have got the most modern televisions, refrigerators, super soft leather sofas, bed and so on. You engage a moving company, who comes, disassembles everything, packs it conveniently. They also make sure to pack as much possible in containers to fill the truck such that they can do it in a single trip. Once they reach the destination, they unpack, assembles and restore everything as it was.</p><p>The same applies to data. When I store some data in MinIO , and I need to feed it to, say, another application, say Spark, the consuming application needs to disassemble the data from MinIO data lake, pack it and transport it through the wire (or wireless), receive, unpack and re-assemble. </p><p>Let's use more technical terms for this disassembly and assembly - serialization and de-serialization of data. The unfortunate part is, both these processes are complex and time consuming. Here is a brief diagram illustrating what happens in Apache Spark when it reads data</p><figure><img src="https://blog.min.io/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-1.54.30-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-1.54.30-AM.png 600w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-1.54.30-AM.png 1000w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-1.54.30-AM.png 1600w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-1.54.30-AM.png 1944w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Experimental setup. Courtesy: <a href="https://databricks.com/session/running-apache-spark-on-a-high-performance-cluster-using-rdma-and-nvme-flash">Spark Summit</a></figcaption></figure><p>You may not have noticed this problem before. Assume that MinIO is on a machine(s) on the network. We write a Spark Map-Reduce application. Eventhough the network limit is 100 GbE, we are almost getting less that 10 GbE speed. What's the use of this high speed network then? What is the potential problem which is not allowing us to utilize the full potential of the network, or at least 70-80% of it?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.min.io/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-2.00.34-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-2.00.34-AM.png 600w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-2.00.34-AM.png 1000w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-2.00.34-AM.png 1600w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-2.00.34-AM.png 1948w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Additional layers, buffers and serializers</figcaption></figure><p>The issues are with the way in which Spark is retrieving the data. Look at the number of layers the data has to pass though. This creates a limit on the throughput that we can achieve. There are projects like <a href="https://crail.apache.org/">Apache Crail,</a> which are designed to address these issues.</p><h2 id="optimization-columnar-data-format">Optimization : Columnar Data Format </h2><div><p>If we think about the relocation example mentioned above, we see that the logistic company will never take the sofa as it is, they will break it down to make it easy to transport. Note that this is for transportation purposes only - if that objective is different, then disassembling the sofa might not be the right approach. </p><p>Given that the objective for a data lake is analytics - rather than transactional needs we must take that under consideration. For transactions, we often use OLTP systems like Oracle or PostGres - given that they are particularly well suited for the job. A quick review of OLAP's analytics requirements is probably in order. </p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.min.io/content/images/2020/09/Picture1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Picture1.png 600w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/2020/09/Picture1.png 966w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Introducing columnar format</figcaption></figure><p>Let's start with one of the most famous RDMBS table - the "emp" table of Oracle. The top part shows how the data is stored in RDBMS as a "relation" or "tuple". We call it a table. I am providing you two queries</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>select ename from emp where job = 'CLERK'</li>
<li>select sum(sal) from emp</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The first is a transactional query. It has to scan every row on the table and find out the name of the employee wherever the job is clerk. The second is an analytical query - rather than an atomic result, the goal is a general result. Unfortunately, the first and second query has to scan through all the rows, if we use RDBMS way of representation of data. If the size of data is 20 GB, all the 20 GB more or less will be scanned. This is the top part of above figure.</p><p>Let's make some changes - taking all of our columns and make them into rows. Like a transpose of a matrix - and see the bottom part of above figure, how your data will look like. Following this transposition, an entire block is just representing one column. How many blocks need to be scanned for the second analytical query? Just one block, probably around 2 GB of size. </p><p>The difference is significant? Columnar representation is what is being used in ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) and Parquet files - with the goal of making the analytics faster.</p><p>Columnar formats are easier to read, however, they pose another problem - they are usually stored in compressed format. As a result, the consuming application will need to uncompress it while reading and compress it back while writing. </p><p>Note this, as we will revisit the point later.</p><h2 id="the-science-of-reading-writing-data">The Science of Reading/Writing Data</h2><p>Let me explain briefly how reading/writing happens in a software system and what role is played by the hardware.</p><p>Microprocessors normally use two methods to connect external devices: <strong>memory mapped</strong> or <strong>port mapped</strong> I/O. </p><p>Memory mapped I/O is mapped into the same address space as program memory and/or user memory, and is accessed in the same way.</p><p>Port mapped I/O uses a separate, dedicated address space and is accessed via a dedicated set of microprocessor instructions.</p><p>In memory mapped approach, I/O devices are mapped into the system memory map along with RAM and ROM. To access a hardware device, simply read or write to those 'special' addresses using the normal memory access instructions.The advantage to this method is that every instruction which can access memory can be used to manipulate an I/O device.</p><p>Usually applications use Port mapped I/O. If we are using memory mapped I/O for a particular format, it will be faster, especially for analytical needs. When combined with our columnar data format, then it becomes even more advantageous.</p><p>Welcome to <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a>. </p><p>Arrow uses memory mapped I/O and avoids serialization/deserialization overheads when you convert between most of the formats while leveraging the columnar data format. </p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://wesmckinney.com/">Wes McKinney</a> for this brilliant innovation, its not a surprise that such an idea came from him and team, as he is well known as the creator of Pandas in Python. He calls Arrow as the future of data transfer.</p><h2 id="store-data-in-minio-in-arrow-format">Store Data in MinIO in Arrow Format</h2><p>This is how we are going to make MinIO even more powerful. </p><p>We are going to store that data in Arrow and then let the consuming applications read it - resulting in dramatically increased speeds. Step one has us putting the data into MinIO in Arrow format. I was using my own approach until I saw a much better implementation from <a href="https://github.com/BryanCutler">Bryan Cutler</a>, whose contributions include integrating Arrow formats to Spark as well.</p><p>We will start with a a .csv file, in this case movie ratings downloaded from the <a href="https://movielens.org/">movielens</a> site. For illustration purposes, I took about 100K rows. First, let's write a Spark program to read this CSV file and write it into Arrow format using Arrow RDD. You can get the full code from the link given towards the bottom of this article.</p><p>Step 1: build.sbt , please note the arrow dependencies</p><figure><img src="https://blog.min.io/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-4.38.17-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-4.38.17-AM.png 600w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-4.38.17-AM.png 1000w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-4.38.17-AM.png 1600w, https://blog.min.io/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-4.38.17-AM.png 1990w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>See lines 18 and 19, we have Arrow related dependencies with Spark</figcaption></figure><p>We will use Spark 3.0, with Apache Arrow 0.17.1</p><p>The ArrowRDD class has an iterator and RDD itself.

        <p>Since the first fears of the pandemic emerged in the U.S. in early March, businesses across the nation have endured six months of uncertainty. Yet, businesses are adapting and proving their resilience through lockdowns, reopenings, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?name=styln-coronavirus-markets&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;variant=1_Show&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;impression_id=76e345d2-e946-11ea-8ee3-5b12c6c78bc9" target="_blank">summer surge in virus cases</a>, new ways of doing business such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/nyregion/outdoor-dining-new-york.html" target="_blank">outdoor dining</a>, new mask wearing rules and backlash from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/18/covid-pandemic-store-clerk-north-carolina/?arc404=true" target="_blank">anti-mask patrons</a>, as well as milestones such as the <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/back-to-school-2020.html" target="_blank">return to school</a>. Even in the wake of increased closures we’re seeing businesses effectively transition to new operating models while keeping their employees and consumers safe.</p>
        <p>Yelp closure data shows that businesses providing home, local and professional services have been able to withstand the effects of the pandemic particularly well. But despite bright spots in some sectors, restaurants and retail continue to struggle and total closures nationwide have started to increase.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q2-2020.html" target="_blank">last Yelp Economic Average</a> showed a decreasing number of overall closures, 132,580 in total. As of August 31, 163,735 total U.S. businesses on Yelp have closed since the beginning of the pandemic (observed as March 1), a 23% increase since July 10. In the wake of COVID-19 cases increasing and local restrictions continuing to change in many states we’re seeing both permanent and temporary closures rise across the nation, with 60% of those closed businesses not reopening (97,966 permanently closed).</p>

    	<h2>Resilient Businesses Operating in an Unpredictable Economy</h2>
        <p>Some business sectors have been able to weather the COVID-19 storm particularly well. In general, professional services and solo proprietors as a whole have been able to maintain a relatively low fraction of closures since March 1. This group includes lawyers, real estate agents, architects, and accountants – all with only two to three out of every thousand businesses closed, as of August 31. Health related businesses in particular have been able to maintain a low rate of closures – orthopedists, internal medicine, hospitals, physicians, family doctors and OB/GYNs all have less than three closures out of every thousand businesses.</p>
        <p>Yelp’s closure data also shows that demand for <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2020/08/yelp-reinvents-the-hiring-experience-for-home-and-local-services" target="_blank">home, local</a> and automotive services has remained robust with a far lower rate of closures compared to restaurants and retail. Towing companies, plumbers and contractors in particular have maintained a low rate of closures, with only six to seven out of every thousand businesses closed. In fact, the share of consumer interest in home and local services is up 24% between March 1 and August 31, relative to all categories on Yelp, compared to the same time last year.</p>

      <h2>Restaurants Remain Hardest Hit, Permanent and Temporary Closures Increase</h2>
        <p>The restaurant industry continues to be among the most impacted with an increasing number of closures – totalling 32,109 closures as of August 31, with 19,590 of these business closures indicated to be permanent (61%). Breakfast and brunch restaurants, burger joints, sandwich shops, dessert places and Mexican restaurants are among the types of restaurants with the highest rate of business closures. Foods that work well for delivery and takeout have been able to keep their closure rates lower than others, including pizza places, delis, food trucks, bakeries and coffee shops.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, bars and nightlife, an industry 6X smaller than restaurants, has endured an especially high closure rate, with an increasing percentage of closures being permanent. As of the end of August there were 6,451 total business closures, of which 3,499 were permanently closed (54%). The share of permanent closures within bars and nightlife have increased by 10% since our <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q2-2020.html" target="_blank">Economic Average Report</a> in July.</p>
        <p>Retail and shopping follows closely behind restaurants with 30,374 total business closures, 17,503 of which are permanent (58%). Similar to bars and nightlife, the share of permanent closures increased by 10% since July. Both men and women’s clothing, as well as home decor, have the highest rate of business closures.</p>
        <p>The beauty industry has seen a 22% increase in closures since July, totalling 16,585 closures. Of all closed businesses in the beauty industry 7,002 won’t reopen (42%), a significant 43% increase since July when we reported that 4,897 of all closures in the beauty industry were permanent. Similarly the fitness industry has endured a 23% increase in closures since July, with 6,024 total closures, 2,616 of which are permanently closed.</p>

      <h2>Larger States and Metros See a Greater COVID-19 Impact on Local Businesses</h2>
        <p>Even as the pandemic spreads nationally, geographically Yelp data shows business closure rates vary across the country. Bigger states and metros with higher rents and more stringent local operations for small businesses throughout the last six months have felt a greater toll. So have businesses more closely linked to physical locations that require crowds of consumers to attain profitability. Meanwhile, smaller cities and solo operations that can do their work one-on-one or virtually have proven better positioned to stay in business.</p>
        <p>For the states with widespread business closures, the economic struggle appears to be closely coupled with unemployment rates. Hawaii, California, and Nevada have the highest rate of total closures and permanent closures – they’re also the three states with the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/these-states-are-suffering-from-the-worst-unemployment-rates-144451899.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABND8yZDak2Xg6GnNC9LukDHqDayj3GYnFbfZn_9NctEnowVC1JMpg9oZFKixnWrRLGLPortUEEaymyEAYmZ0jMN8vOuriLR1N7S0Roqv9OT99H-WdN5XH_sd_I_r0-EgEJSDExY9yTtI7Xduv3Q-Agxb55dUepi3-k8T1fGZ153" target="_blank">highest unemployment rates</a>, and among the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-most-visited-states-in-the-us.html" target="_blank">biggest states for tourism</a>. Meanwhile, West Virginia and the Dakotas have the lowest closure rates.</p>
        <p>The states with the most closures are home to the hardest-hit metros: Las Vegas in Nevada, Honolulu in Hawaii, and several of the largest California urban areas all are among the metro areas with the highest total closure and permanent closure rates (San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles and others), with roughly 20 businesses per thousand temporarily or permanently closing their doors since March 1. Larger metros with far fewer closures tend to be in the East, including Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, all with closure rates below 10 per thousand.</p>

    	<h2>Methodology</h2>
    
    		<p><em>Business Closures</em></p>
    		<p>On each date, starting with March 1, we count U.S. businesses that were open on March 1 and were closed on that day. Closure can be permanent or temporary, and is signaled by a business owner marking the business as closed, including by changing its hours or through a COVID-19 banner on its Yelp page. Closure counts are likely an estimate of the businesses most impacted, with many others not counted because they remain open with curtailed hours and staffing, or because they have not yet updated their Yelp business pages to reflect closures. Additionally, we only count closures that have been vetted by our User Ops team or have been updated directly by a business owner. Closures are counted by state, metro area, and category; some businesses are in more than one category. Businesses can also set automatic reopening dates on Yelp, which are counted as reopenings unless the business updates their information.</p>

<p>I decided I wanted to try making some skeletonised leaves. So I did some Googling and decided to try <a href="https://penguinbaybiology.org/make-clear-leaf-view-vein-structure/">this</a> approach.</p>



<p>We went out in the evening and gathered some leaves from the local  Shrubbery. Totally not suspicious 🙂</p>

<p>I bought some Sodium Hydroxide and a cheap steel pot from ebay. Note: it must <strong>not</strong> be Aluminium as the Sodium Hydroxide will react with Aluminium!</p>

<p>Although Sodium Hydroxide isn’t a deadly poison, you really don’t want it on your skin or in your eyes, so gloves/goggles are a necessity for safety. Hmm, I should really look into some sort of cheap lab coat as well to protect my clothes for this sorta stuff:</p>

<p>I scaled up the proportions to 1L of (Edinburgh) tap water and 30G of Sodium Hydroxide powder. I put them in the pot, brought it to the boil and added the leaves. </p>



<p>For fun I also tested the pH of the solution with my new pH paper (also from Ebay/China). Its about a 14, so pretty alkaline!</p>

<p>The instructions suggested boiling for about two hours, but it appears to depend on the leaves you choose. I checked on it every 20 minutes or so, and pulled leaves out as they became ready. </p>



<p>To process them, I had the following set up next to the pot:</p>



<ul><li>Tray 1: Plain tap water to wash off the Sodium Hydroxide.</li><li>Tray 2: Some “Ordinary Household Bleach” (aka Sodium Hypochlorite) to bleach any remaining colour out.</li><li>Tray 3: More plain tap water to wash off the bleach.</li><li>A sheet of alumunium foil to put the leaves on to dry out.</li></ul>



<p>After all of them were processed, I ended up with this:</p>

<p>The next morning I was able to unpeel the more robust leaves, yielding me these:</p>

<p>Observations</p>



<ul><li>You need to use <em>robust</em> leaves from trees. I tried some nettle leaves, but they quickly turned to mush. Some of the tree leaves appeared to process fine, but turned out to be way too delicate to remove from the foil after drying: definitely depends on the species. There may be a better way to dry them, will think on it.</li><li>Only process one species of leaf at a time, otherwise you constantly have to check each one in the pot, which means you’re disturbing them more to check.</li><li>Make sure to check on the water level! I <em>almost</em> boiled it dry.</li><li>Its fiddly! During processing, you have to <em>carefully</em> unroll the leaves by hand while wearing gloves to get them flat prior to drying.</li><li>I tried processing a dried up Oak leaf since theoretically it should be closer to being skeletonised: it didn’t seem to work very well (you can see the unsuccessful result on the aluminium foil photo).</li></ul>



<p>What Next?</p>



<p>They’re definitely more robust than I expected, but they’re still quite delicate. I fancy trying dying them and embedding them into some transparent resin next.</p>

<p>I’ll try to explain how this script worked and how I was able to fit the whole thing into 280 characters.</p>



<p>All of this started when last week when I was experimenting with the p5js <code>curve()</code> function. Internally this is an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline" title="Centripetal Catmull–Rom spline">Centripetal Catmull–Rom spline</a>. I tried generating a bunch of 8 legged water spiders for fun :)</p>

<video controls="" muted="" src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1303620577589039104/pu/vid/720x720/8iYWjReFxe-9kWVl.mp4?tag=10">
</video>

<p>I admit this looks pretty stupid. The aim was to generate an animation a whole bunch of water spiders with the camera panning around. But then, for me to understand how exactly the Catmull-Rom spline worked, I decided to randomly plot a bunch of curves on a 2D canvas and it somehow resembled handwriting from my native language (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam">Malayalam</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-12.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Actual Malayalam handwriting sample.<br>

<p>Reducing character spacing.. Do you see the similarity now?<br>
<img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-10.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Also, at this time I was playing the PC remaster of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game)">Journey (2012)</a>. Journey has a very beautiful blocky scriptures all over the temples in the game.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/eayhyxhueaagmqu.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I guessed this is pretty easy generate. I made a few attempts to reproduce the approximate style using p5.js</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-8.png" alt=""></p>

<p>and even an infinite scrolling version</p>

<video controls="" muted="" src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1304311867284664323/pu/vid/720x720/zNWZ-LQrIl0KrnCU.mp4?tag=10">
</video>

<p>This script had some serious performance issues(you can see it slowing down towards the end). Later I learned that this style of meaningless writing is a thing in the art community known as Generative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing">Asemic Writing</a>. According to Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Asemic writing</strong> is a wordless open semantic form of writing. The word asemic means “having no specific semantic content”. With the nonspecificity of asemic writing there comes a vacuum of meaning which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I decided to combine the two and make an infinite generator of malayalam-esque asemic writing. I’ve seen curve generated asemic <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asemic/comments/dw5ze3/generative_script/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link">before</a>. So, What I did is not something new.. however, maybe the way I made it infinite scrolling was something new(?). I’ll try to explain how the code works.</p>



<p>I lost the original script in the minifying process, but I managed to unminify the tweet somehow.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var yOffset = 24;
var scrollPosition = 0;
var canvasWidth = 800;
var margin = 90

function setup() {
    createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasWidth)
    noFill();
}

function deterministicRandom(index) {
  return 1000 / 3 * noise(index) - 90
}

function draw() {
    background('#fd7');
    translate(0, scrollPosition--);

    for (i = 0, y = 0; y &lt; canvasWidth - scrollPosition; y += yOffset)
        for (x = 90; x &lt; canvasWidth - margin;) {
            if (y + margin &gt; -scrollPosition) {
                curve(
                  deterministicRandom(i++) + x, 
                  deterministicRandom(i++) + y, 
                  x, 
                  y + yOffset, 
                  x + 9, 
                  y + yOffset, 
                  deterministicRandom(i++) + x, 
                  deterministicRandom(i++) + y
                )
            } else {
                i += 4
            }
            x += (9 + deterministicRandom(i++) % 9)
            if (noise(x * y) &lt; .13)
            {
              y += 2*yOffset
              x = margin
            }
        }

}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The most important part of the code is the function <code>deterministicRandom()</code> which is used a lot of times in the sketch. It’s basically <code>noise()</code> but mapped to range <code>[243, -90]</code>. p5 js <code>curve()</code> takes in 2 control point and 2 physical point coordinate to determine the location and shape of the curve. Each character is is thus a set of 4 deterministically random numbers for control points + 4 constants for physical points. All of these points are offset by a base <code>&lt;x,y&gt;</code> coordinate to place the curve in a line. <em>Because it’s deterministically random, the shapes and location of the curves are preserved in every frame</em>.. making the infinite scroll effect work.</p>

<p>The 2 loops iterate over x and y, at a constant rate. x by 9 pixels and y by 24 pixels. But, inside the loop, based on deterministic random, x is randomly incremented by up to 9 pixels to simulate the randomness in spaces between characters. Also, if for a random condition with somewhat low probability (<code>noise(x * y) &lt; .13</code>), a line-break is added. Which means, y is incremented thrice in that loop and x is reset to a margin value (90).</p>





<p>The infinite scroll effect is basically done using <code>translate(0, scrollPosition--)</code>. The loop termination clause is adjusted such that only lines within the frame are rendered (between <code>y = scrollPosition to scrollPosition+canvasHeight</code>). The condition <code>y + margin &gt; -scrollPosition</code> directly inside the loop checks for this. This also offsets the random number index to the one needed by the lines being rendered in the else case. Here’s a version of the script that shows lines being rendered as the script runs:</p>



<p>And that’s basically it. The initial version I designed rendered every line from the first scroll position to the last in every frame, even if those lines were not visible. This is terrible for performance and the if condition inside the loop fixed this.</p>



<p>Step one of minifying was converting all the functions to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow functions</a>. This took up way less space. Then I moved all the <code>setup()</code> stuff to <code>draw()</code>. p5 does not re-execute <code>createCanvas</code> even if you place it in <code>draw()</code>. Then I had to cut down number of variables as much as I can. 2 of them were reused: <code>canvasWidth(w)</code> and <code>margin(k)</code> were also used as a coefficient in <code>deterministicRandom()</code>. Finally spaces were removed and long names were truncated to single characters.</p>



<p>This script was written in about 2-3 hours. Looking back, I can see a lot of places where I’d try to reduce repeated code and make it smoother. I never thought this would go so popular, so I never really cared to optimize so much. But there you go.. a simple way to generate bad handwriting :)</p>

    <p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/matching_squares.png"></p>
      
    
  </div><div><p>A month after the initial Bevy release, and thanks to <strong>87</strong> contributors, <strong>174</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="async-task-system">Async Task System</h2>

<p>Bevy uses multi-threading throughout the engine: ECS scheduling, asset loading, rendering, etc. Before this release it used <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">Rayon</a> for almost all of these tasks. Rayon is nice because it is generally as simple as calling <code>some_list.par_iter().for_each(|x| do_something(x))</code>. Rayon then automatically breaks the <code>for_each</code> into tasks and runs them on as many cores as it can. Rayon is a great choice if you want to easily parallelize code, but it has the downside of being pretty cpu-hungry.</p>
<p>Bevy (and a number of other rust game engines and ecs frameworks using rayon) have received feedback that they were overly cpu hungry / usage was not proportional to "real" work done.</p>
<p>We decided to resolve this problem by building a custom async-friendly task system, which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also gives us the flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority. The cpu usage wins have been huge:</p>
<h3 id="total-combined-percent-cpu-usage-8-core-machine-smaller-is-better">Total Combined Percent CPU Usage - 8 Core Machine (smaller is better)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy_tasks_1.svg" alt="threading cpu usage 8 core"></p>
<h3 id="total-combined-percent-cpu-usage-32-core-machine-smaller-is-better">Total Combined Percent CPU Usage - 32 Core Machine (smaller is better)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy_tasks_2.svg" alt="threading cpu usage 32 core"></p>
<h2 id="initial-web-platform-support">Initial Web Platform Support</h2>
<p>authors: @smokku</p>
<p>(A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound. </p>
<p>Those limitations haven't stopped @mrk-its from building the first WASM Bevy game!</p>
<h3 id="bevy-robbo-playable-here"><a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo">bevy-robbo</a> (<a href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/mrk-public/bevy-robbo/index.html">playable here</a>)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy-robbo.png" alt="bevy-robbo"></p>
<p>They use Bevy for game logic and cleverly work around the render limitations by passing ASCII art game state from <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/src/systems/js_render.rs">this Bevy system</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/assets/render.js">this JavaScript function</a>. </p>
<p>You can play around with some Bevy WASM examples by <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/master/examples#wasm">following the instructions here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-queries">Parallel Queries</h2>
<p>authors: @GrantMoyer</p>
<p>Bevy ECS Queries are a flexible way to retrieve data from the Entity Component System. Systems that <em>use</em> queries already run in parallel, but before this change the queries themselves could not be <em>iterated</em> in parallel. <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>pool</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ComputeTaskPool</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Transform</span><span>&gt;) {</span><span>
    query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>par_iter</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>).</span><span>for_each</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>pool</span><span>, |</span><span>mut </span><span>transform</span><span>| {</span><span>
      transform</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>Vec3</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>));
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This provides a nice functional api (similar to Rayon) that runs on top of the new <code>bevy_tasks</code> system. It breaks the query up into 32 "batches" and runs each batch as a different task in the bevy task system. </p>
<h2 id="transform-system-rewrite">Transform System Rewrite</h2>
<p>authors: @MarekLg</p>
<pre><code><span>// old
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>translation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Translation, </span><span>rotation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Rotation, </span><span>scale</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Scale</span><span>) {

}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Bevy's old transform system used separate <code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, and <code>Scale</code> components as the "source of truth". Users modified with these components in their systems, after which they were synced to a <code>LocalTransform</code> component, which was in turn synced to a global <code>Transform</code> component, taking hierarchy into account. This was nice for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly more cache efficient to retrieve individual components like <code>Translation</code> (because less data needs to be accessed)</li>
<li>Theoretically more parallel-friendly. Systems that only access <code>Translation</code> won't block systems accessing <code>Rotation</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However this approach also has some pretty serious downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "individual components" are the source of truth, so <code>LocalTransform</code> is out of date when user systems are running. If an up to date "full transform" is needed, it must be manually constructed by accessing all three components.</li>
<li>Very hard to reason about. There are 5 components users need to think about and they all interact with each other differently.</li>
<li>Setting a Transform to a specific matrix value (ex: <code>Mat4::look_at()</code>) was extremely cumbersome, and the value would be immediately overwritten unless the user explicitly disabled component syncing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these issues, we decided to move to a single unified local-to-parent <code>Transform</code> component as the source of truth, and a computed <code>GlobalTransform</code> component for world-space transforms. We think this api will be much easier to use and to reason about. <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeante/79d25ec3a0e86436e53eb74f3ac82c0c">Unity is also considering a similar Transform rework for their ECS</a> and a lot of discussion on this topic happened in this <a href="https://community.amethyst.rs/t/legion-transform-design-discussion">Amethyst Forum Thread</a>.</p>

<h3 id="generational-entity-ids">Generational Entity IDs</h3>
<p>We changed Entity IDs from being random UUIDs to incrementing generational indices. Random UUIDs were nice because they could be created anywhere, were unique across game runs, and could be safely persisted to files or reused across networks. I was really hoping we could make them work, but they ended up being too slow relative to the alternatives. The randomness had a measurable cost and entity locations had to be looked up using a hash map.</p>
<p>By moving to generational indices (we use the hecs implementation), we can directly use entity ids as array indices, which makes entity location lookups lightning fast.</p>
<h3 id="read-only-queries">Read Only Queries</h3>
<p>I implemented "read only" traits for queries that don't mutate anything. This allows us to guarantee that a query won't mutate anything.</p>
<h3 id="removed-locking-from-world-apis">Removed locking from World apis</h3>
<p>This gives us a really nice speed boost. We can do this safely due to a combination of the new "read only queries" and changing World mutation apis to be a mutable World borrow.</p>
<p>This is not yet enabled for <code>Queries</code> in systems because a system could have multiple <code>Queries</code>, which could be simultaneously accessed in a way that doesn't make mutable access unique. I think thats a solve-able problem, but it will take a bit more work. Fortunately "for-each" systems don't have any collision risk, so we now use lock-less queries there.</p>
<h3 id="direct-component-lookup-in-nanoseconds-smaller-is-better">Direct component lookup (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)</h3>
<p>As a result of these optimizations, direct component lookup is <em>much</em> faster than it used to be:</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/get_component.svg" alt="get_component graph"></p>
<p>Note that this benchmark used <code>world.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code>. <code>query.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code> should have results similar to the <code>hecs</code> results because it still uses a lock. Eventually I'm hoping that we can remove locks from system queries too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
      Legal questions aside, let's explore the technical possibilities.
    </p><div>

<p>Let’s be very clear here. I am not a fan of TikTok. I had the misfortune of coming across it when it was still called Musically and I had to explain to a little girl that she, unlike her friends, was not allowed to dance for strangers. That ruined an otherwise perfect evening.</p>

<p>I’m also not a fan of Donald Trump(et). It’s safe to assume that he threatens to shut down TikTok for all the wrong reasons, but if he manages to pull through, it will be a benefit for mankind. So, is it actually technically possible to get TikTok and WeChat banned in the US?</p>

<h2 id="removing-apps-from-google-play">Removing apps from Google Play</h2>

<p>Story time (you can skip ahead two paragraphs for an obvious revelation)!</p>

<p>I once wrote a pretty silly slot machine game for Android. It was as a coding exercise and failed in pretty much every aspect except being recognized for what it actually wasn’t: a real gambling app.
</p><figure>
  <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/pocketbandit.png">

  <figcaption>Pocket Bandit: pretty (, colorful,) boring</figcaption>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
All you could do was to bet one to three coins, then pull the lever and watch the reels spin. You started with a fixed amount of credit and the laws of probability dictated that you’d eventually go bankrupt. Once that happened, you could simply restarted the “game” and had a full purse again. No <em>wait x hours or pay $$$ to continue playing</em> bullshit. No way of winning anything either. In other words: the most boring one-armed bandit ever. Not even suitable for detoxing a gambling addict. I had somehow managed to put in all the mechanics of a classical slot machine except the one (winning/loosing) that was responsible for producing the excitement.</p>

<p>Well, there’s no rule that states, you can’t publish rubbish on Google Play. Much to my surprise though, there is a rule that says, you can’t publish gambling apps in some Arab countries without governmental approval. So, one fateful morning, I received a mail from Google telling me that my app had been pulled from Play in those countries. I was pissed. Not because the world needed my app. Not because some Arabs were now deprived of the most dull entertainment, only I could provide. I was pissed because someone had obviously only spent the time of looking at the screenshots to determine that this was a gambling app, but hadn’t bothered to reason how you were suppose to spend (real) money in an app that doesn’t even request network permission. It felt unjustified. Like a downvote driven in with the banhammer. Someone with the attention span of a puppy had the power of Thor.</p>

<p>There was no point in appealing. After all, the game was crap, but the incident was a nice reminder on how fragile businesses, build on apps are. Somewhere, someone with too little time to be thorough can simply nuke them without prior warning. Needless to say, that in time, the same  kind of sloppiness resulted in more of my apps being pulled …</p>

<p>So, what’s the take away from my story?</p>

<p>Geo fencing has always been a core feature of Play and Google never really went out of its way to stand up for developers. Sure, my apps are small fries compared to behemoths like TikTok, but then again, they aren’t direct competitors to youtube either. Let’s keep that in mind in case anyone has high hopes for Google putting up a fight.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-sideloading">What about sideloading?</h2>

<p>Who needs Play anyway? Android is not IOS, we can simply download the APK off the web and install it ourselves, right? Eh well, no. It’s not that simple. Bytedance swallowed Google’s Cool Aid and switched to App Bundles/Dynamic Delivery in order to reduce the size of their app. So instead of a single, one size fits all APK, you get a bunch of individual files. In case of TikTok v17.6.3 and depending on your device, the list might look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_config.armeabi_v7a.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_config.en.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_config.xhdpi.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_creationtool_so.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_creationtool_so.config.armeabi_v7a.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_fusing.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_photomovie.apk</li>
</ul>

<p>Split APKs cannot be sideloaded (easily). On plain Android, there’s simply no user interface for telling the packagemanager that you want it to install an app from several connected files (<a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/merge-split-apk/">after all, making sideloading difficult was/is the whole idea behind App Bundles</a>). You need extra tools (e.g. ADB) for that. But let’s be brutally honest here, if you are in the target audience of TikTok, then you are probably missing a brain cell or two (out of a total of two) and won’t be able to use them.</p>

<div>
  
  <p><span>Fun fact</span>
  
  
App Bundles have a build in security flaw. Traditional APKs cannot be modified by the Playstore. App Bundles can. For rogue government agencies, this provides the option of pushing hacked app updates to </p><u>selected</u><p> individuals. For that reason, <b>no</b> app in the "communications" category should ever use App Bundles as a distribution format. Imagine that! Coincidentally, Trump was actually right when calling TikTok a security issue. Cheers ByteDance!

</p></div>
                             
                             

<p>So, why doesn’t ByteDance simply host a traditional APK on the TikTok website then?</p>

<p>Two reasons actually</p>

<ol>
<li>Self hosting your app means, people will download the self hosted version (duh!), even if they could get it from the Playstore. As a result, the Playstore version sees less downloads, less reviews and less ratings which may eventually lead to it spiraling down in the rankings (ever wondered why all youtubers end their videos with the magic mantra “like and subscribe, hit the bell and give me a thumbs up”? Same mechanic there). This, by the way was the leverage, Google used to monopolize the app store market on Android: you are free to host elsewhere, but if your competitors solely host with us, they will eventually outrank you.</li>
<li>ByteDance not only drank the Google Cool aid, but also coughed it up and swallowed it again. Part of their revenue is in-app purchases. Those don’t work with sideloaded APKs. They could, of course, implement their own <abbr title="In App Purchase">IAP</abbr>, but that’s something <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/2020081401/">Epic tried with Fortnite</a> recently…</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="removing-existing-tiktok-installations-from-devices">Removing existing TikTok installations from devices</h2>

<p>Buckle up, this may come as a surprise or as a confirmation of your fears!</p>

<p>Did you ever notice the big green “install” button on the Google Play website? With it, you can conveniently browse the store on your PC and send apps to your phone for installation.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/googleplay-tiktok.png">
    <img src="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/googleplay-tiktok.png">
  </a>
  
  <figcaption>Screencap: The install button on the Play website is sort off a remnant from the old days when 320x480 screens where the norm and you'd rather browse the androidmarket (as it was called back then) on your PC.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
                             
                             

<p>This is done via “Push messages”. Which is just a modern way of saying that your phone wakes up every couple of minutes in order to waste battery and bandwidth on checking if there are any new ads you should see. It also checks if there are any app updates or pending installs (from the green button) while it is at it, just so you have a reason not to disable the <del>spy</del> playstore app when you don’t need it. The relevant <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">message structure</a> looks like this:</p>

<span> <img src="https://www.randombio.com/O40gray-gray.png" alt="O" title="O"></span>
n September 14 2020, Li-Meng Yan, a dissident Chinese virologist, along with three
colleagues, posted an article at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4028830">zenodo.org</a>
<sup>[1]</sup> claiming to prove that SARS-CoV-2 was artificially created. Twitter 
canceled the author's account two days later and political activists vociferously 
attacked the paper on political grounds. It is clear that many people don't want to 
hear her evidence. But the issue is extremely important. If the virus was produced 
in an experiment and accidentally released, as this paper claims, it means the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology is in dire need of upgrades to their virus-handling procedures 
to prevent it from happening again.
</p><p>
My background is 30 years as a researcher in protein biochemistry using biophysical 
techniques and molecular biology, including design, cloning, and expression of 
recombinant proteins, to study protein function and structure. Here's a brief
summary of the argument put forward in the paper along with my comments.
</p><p>
<i>Update, Sep 20 2020</i>: I've expanded the comments to describe the evidence they
would need to make their case more convincing.
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 1:</b> 
   “[the sequences of] RaTG13, RmYN02, and several pangolin viruses recently
   published are highly suspicious and likely fraudulent.”
   “The RaTG13 virus is excluded from this analysis given the strong evidence 
   suggesting that its sequence may have been fabricated and the virus does not exist 
   in nature.”
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b>
   RaTG13 was published by Shi Zhengli at the same time as the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. 
   In 2013 Shi also published a partial gene segment of RaBtCoV/4991, which is identical 
   to RaTG13, but it is incomplete. The authors say that the WIV took this partial
   sequence and fraudulently added the remainder to exculpate themselves, trying
   to make it appear that RaTG13 was a pre-existing virus. 
</p><p>
   Evidence in favor of this claim is that Shi <i>et al.</i> made no mention of 
   RaBtCoV/4991 in their 2020 paper. But unless someone wants to claim that 4991 
   was also fabricated, RaBtCoV/4991 had to come from somewhere, which is to say it is 
   a real virus. So Claim 1 doesn't make sense. 
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b>
   To prove this the authors would have to find another virus that is 100% identical 
   with the published partial RaBtCoV/4991 sequence but which differs from RaTG13. 
</p><hr><p>

<b>Claim 2:</b> 
   The WIV could have used transgenic hACE2 transgenic mice to improve the virus's
   ability to bind to its receptor. “This animal model 
   has been established during the study of SARS-CoV and has been available in the 
   Jackson Laboratory [a commercial supplier of transgenic mice] for many years.”
   However, hACE2 mice are “not a good model to reflect the virus' transmissibility
   and associated clinical symptoms in humans.” If they had used golden Syrian
   hamster instead, the authors say, “the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 
   would be extremely evident” and they could have released accurate information.
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   This is a good point. If true, it would tend to exculpate the Chinese researchers.
   But we already know many techniques they could have used. No one was claiming 
   that making the virus was impossible. 
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   Sending live animals to another country requires tons of paperwork. They would need
   Jax's sales records or government export records (which might be available via a
   FOIA request). 
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 3:</b> 
   The paper provides a flow chart for how the virus could have been constructed.
   “Two restriction sites are present at either end of the RBM [receptor-binding
   motif] of SARS-CoV-2, providing convenience for replacing the RBM within the spike 
   gene.”
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   The spike protein consists of two parts: S1, which binds to the receptor, and S2,
   which fuses the viral and cellular membranes. The point where the subunits are joined 
   is called the S1/S2 site. Proteolysis of this site is essential for infection.
   The RBM is the part of S1 that binds to the receptor. A common technique is 
   to take functional domains out of one protein and put them into another. The easiest 
   way to do this is by finding (or creating) restriction sites in the DNA that allow 
   you to cut the DNA in a specific place.
</p><p>
   The flow chart is quite reasonable, but again no one doubted that artificially 
   creating the virus is possible. So describing how someone could have done it
   doesn't tell us much; any competent molecular biologist could come up with
   a similar scheme.
</p><p>
   The article makes a big deal about the presence of restriction sites on the S1/S2 
   sequence, including an <code>EcoRI</code> site and a <code>BstEII</code> site. 
   But this does not indicate engineering. Many restriction sites occur naturally by 
   chance. Their presence is not unusual, but they are a major inconvenience for those 
   of us who try to clone DNA—many restriction sites we might wish to use are 
   ruled out by the presence of another one in an inconvenient location. The 
   probability of finding one of over a thousand known 
   <a href="http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html">restriction sites</a> at an 
   arbitrary location in a 3800 base sequence by chance is very high.
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   To prove this convincingly, the authors would need to find an authentic copy 
   of the original virus sequence without the restriction sites to show what the virus 
   was like before the supposed change was made. 
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 4:</b> 
   The furin cleavage site contains rare codons, an unusual sequence not shared by other 
   lineage B betacoronaviruses, and a <code>FauI</code> restriction site. It 
   could not have been introduced by evolution, say the authors, and the probability 
   of successful homologous recombination ever occurring among the ancestors of these 
   viruses is low. “A  <code>FauI</code> restriction site is formulated by the codon choices 
   here, suggesting the possibility that the restriction fragment length polymorphism,
   a technique that a WIV lab is proficient at, could have been involved.”
   The authors suggest that the <code>FauI</code> site was added to monitor the presence
   of the furin-cleavage site.
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   The furin cleavage site is known to increase the tropism of the virus, and it is 
   now known that the virus even infects the brain, but there is little evidence so
   far that it increases pathogenicity. There is as yet no good explanation for the 
   presence of the furin cleavage site. 
</p><p>
   It might make sense for a virus creator to put a restriction site in the middle of
   the furin cleavage site to make sure it didn't disappear. RFLP analysis is a simple 
   technique and any molecular biology lab could handle it easily. However, as mentioned,
   restriction sites pop up randomly all the time, so finding one proves little.
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   The <code>FauI</code> restriction site is a red herring. To prove that the furin cleavage
   site was added, the authors would have to find a trail of evidence showing step
   by step how the sequence was manipulated from whatever virus the WIV started from.
   It would also be helpful to have data showing that furin cleavage increases 
   pathogenicity. This is plausible but it needs to be shown experimentally.
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 5:</b> 
   WIV most likely used ZC45 and ZXC21, not RaTG13, to create SARS-CoV-2 because RaTG13 is 
   not real. The reasoning behind this claim is that the S1 sequence of SARS-CoV-2 
   is quite similar to these other viruses except for the receptor-binding motif and 
   furin-cleavage sites. Also, two other proteins on these viruses, the Orf8 protein 
   and E protein, are 94.2% and 100% identical to SARS-CoV-2.
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   This is indeed strange but so far circumstantial.
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   The authors need to prove that RaTG13 is not real. They claim to have evidence,
   and I look forward to seeing it,  but to be convincing it would have to be more 
   than the discovery of mysterious unexplained features in the DNA sequence.
</p><hr><p>
The authors say they plan to prove that RaTG13 is fabricated in a follow-up report. 
If they can do this, it would be solid evidence of consciousness of guilt on the part 
of WIV researchers. However, the current paper doesn't say very much more than what 
other bloggers have already revealed.
</p><p>
It would be premature to draw any conclusion about the origins of the virus from this
paper. The authors have set for themselves a difficult and possibly impossible task: 
finding a signature of intel­ligent design in a virus is much like what the 
creationists have been doing without success for years. 
</p><p>
But what is not premature is that social media giants deciding for us what is 
true and what is false may turn out to be as big a threat as the virus. It is unfair 
and unscientific to dismiss ideas that one doesn't want to hear as “conspiracy 
theories” as many people are doing.

    <date>17 September 2020</date>
      <p>When I joined the Financial Times as Technical Director for FT.com, I inherited a team of around 50 engineers. One of the first things I did was meet each of them for a one-to-one. I was initially resistant, but it was extremely valuable, I’m glad I did it, and I would definitely do it again in a future role.</p>

<h2 id="my-mentors-advice-about-the-content-of-the-meeting">My mentor’s advice about the content of the meeting</h2>

<p>The idea was suggested to me by a mentor, who’d been advised to do it by <em>his</em> mentor, a Rear Admiral, who said this was something you should do whenever you have a team of fewer than 150 people. My mentor gave me some tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be clear about whether you will take action or whether this is for information only.</li>
  <li>This should mostly be about listening – you should talk for maybe 5 minutes and they should talk for 25.</li>
  <li>It’s to find out what’s going well and what’s not going well.</li>
  <li>It’s informal, but make sure it’s in an enclosed meeting room so that people feel they can speak freely.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it will be quite boring, sometimes you may just learn a lot about someone’s family or hobbies, but that is useful from a getting to know people/relationship-building perspective and it means that you know some things about that person.</li>
  <li>Aim is to get a bit about their background, their priorities and their pressures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-time-was-hard">Making time was hard</h2>

<p>I was initially resistant because of the time commmitment. With a team of ~50, that’s a lot of hours, and I was also working four days a week so each meeting takes up a greater proportion of time. However, once I’d made the decision to do this and announced my intention, it was important to me to follow through, so I made sure to make time.</p>

<p>I scheduled four of these 1:1s a week, starting with the people reporting directly to me and then on down the management chain.</p>

<h2 id="i-ran-each-meeting-in-the-same-way">I ran each meeting in the same way</h2>

<p>Firstly I ran through everything I planned to cover, and then stepped through it.</p>


<ul>
  <li>I am asking the same questions to everyone</li>
  <li>This is information for me only to get an idea of themes and how things are going; I’m not explicitly planning to take action on anything we discuss, so if something comes up that I need to take action on, let’s make sure we discuss that after this meeting</li>
  <li>This is confidential. If you say something about someone else I’m not going to go and tell them. I may report on ‘what people are saying’, but I’ll say ‘the engineers feel’ or ‘an engineer said’; I won’t say “[Your name] said…”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-going-to-discuss">What we’re going to discuss</h3>

<ul>
  <li>First I’ll introduce myself, and tell you a bit about my background</li>
  <li>Then, if you like, I’d love you to tell me a bit about yourself – as much or as little as you feel like sharing</li>
  <li>Then we’ll discuss the following questions:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
  <li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
  <li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
  <li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-i-should-know-about">Is there anything I should know about?</h2>

<p>When I asked this question I talked a bit about why I was asking. I explained that I might not necessarily see or know things that may seem apparent to them, and while they should always feel able to bring things to me, now was a good opportunity to do so. It was an opportunity to make sure I’ve heard what’s important to you, what things should change and what things should stay the same.</p>

<p>This question always elicited very interesting responses, from organisational issues, to personal information people felt it was valuable for me to know about them.</p>

<h2 id="i-told-them-what-i-was-planning-to-ask-in-advance">I told them what I was planning to ask in advance</h2>

<p>I put all the information in the meeting invite.</p>

<div>
<p>I mentioned that I wanted to have a chat with everyone on FT.com to understand how things are going, does this time suit you for this?</p>

<p>The meeting agenda is the same for everyone; a quick intro and then the following questions (I'll go through this in the meeting too):</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
<li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
<li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
<li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>
</div>

<p>Some people did not read the meeting invite and came with no idea what the meeting was about. Some people had fully prepared and written notes that they then read out to me. Actually people having prepared sometimes was less useful, because sometimes it led the conversation to solutions rather than problems. However it was great that people had really given it some thought.</p>

<h2 id="making-notes-felt-too-much-like-a-promise">Making notes felt too much like a promise</h2>

<p>Each meeting was half an hour. In the very first one, I made notes in a notebook, but I realised that created an implicit commitment that I was going to take action on everything that was said, even though I had said it was information only.</p>

<p>However, I do not have a very good memory, so for all the subsequent ones I made a few notes after each meeting of key themes. This meant I couldn’t do more than two in a row or go straight into another meeting, so it made scheduling slightly harder. These days, people are much more aware of the shorter meeting approach so if doing this again, I’d go for the ‘therapy hour’ – 25 minutes for conversation then 5 minutes for me to make the notes.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-myself">Introducing myself</h2>

<p>In my intro, I gave a potted career history. Starting from my degree in philosophy, and my first career in <a href="https://www.barringtonstoke.co.uk/">children’s book publishing</a>, through teaching myself to code, my <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/uk/postgraduate/information-technology-software-systems.htm">masters in Software Systems</a> and then my 15+ year career in programming, infrastructure and operations, technical architecture, and my previous role as <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/a-year-in-the-life-os-lead.html">Open Source lead</a>. I also talked about what appealed to me about the job as Technical Director at the FT.</p>

<p>I said roughly the same thing to everyone. I don’t normally introduce myself and give my background, but in this case I thought that as a new Tech Director most of them would not be working closely with me, and I would not be contributing code, so it was worth giving my credentials.</p>

<p>My mentor had suggested I also say something personal. I think he intended something like “married with two children” (or whatever), but instead, I tried to give a different kind of personal detail, something about my interests. I tried to come up with a different one for each conversation, for example something about my <a href="https://twitter.com/annashipman/status/1043917006477643777">cross-stitch hobby</a>.</p>

<p>This part was the hardest part for me, because prior to this I had generally enjoyed keeping a clear boundary between work stuff and personal stuff, so that definitely didn’t cover talking about cross-stitch, or my home life, on a first meeting. However, I had been trying to bring more of my personal self to work, and this part of the intro did lead to some really interesting conversations and I think helped make a better connection.</p>

<p>Of course, these days, when we are all at home, my personal life is in meetings with me, so it’s good I’d already started on that journey!</p>

<p>Giving so much information in my introduction also allowed the other person to introduce themselves how they wanted. Some talked career history, some focused on their hobbies, others were really open about their lives and aspirations.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-so-glad-i-did-this">I am so glad I did this</h2>

<p>My mentor was wrong about one thing –&nbsp;none of the conversations were boring.</p>

<p>In my first few months in the new job, I often felt really stretched for time, but I never regretted a single one of these meetings; it was always extremely interesting, my team are brilliant and it was great to meet them one on one, and each conversation always contained some valuable information.</p>

<p>There were two very valuable things about this for me.</p>

<p>The first was getting an idea of what change was needed. These meetings gave me a brilliant insight that wasn’t available elsewhere. Patterns started emerging very quickly, and formed the basis of our <a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/the-difficult-teenage-years-setting-tech-strategy-after-a-launch-7f42eb94a424">tech strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The second was building relationships. A lot of the people I had 1:1s with I would not have come into contact with during the course of the ordinary working week. It would have taken time to meet everyone at socials, and it wouldn’t have been the same quality of conversation. I still feel, two years on, that I know a bit about all the people I had those conversations with, which has felt to me like a good foundation for our subsequent conversations.</p>

<p>It was also good, as someone who is a bit shy, to have names to faces quite quickly and people to say hello to when walking round the office.</p>

<h2 id="was-it-useful-for-my-team">Was it useful for my team?</h2>

<p>About a year later, I asked some of the people with whom I’d had these conversations whether they’d been useful (in an anonymous form).</p>

<p>All of the people who responded said they found the conversation valuable, and some of their comments were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“It broke down barriers and helped me feel less intimidated about approaching you, whether to talk about work or just to have a general chit chat. You are a very busy person who I wouldn’t ever work with directly so it was good to feel that you knew I existed.”</li>
  <li>“There is hardly any opportunity for me to talk to people in higher position like you except when the team has a big problem. The 1:1 was really casual and I felt really comfortable talking to you. It was a good time to know what kind of person you are. If we didn’t do the 1:1, the answer of the question below “Do you feel able to raise issues with me?” would be “No”.”</li>
  <li>“We sat down when you first started and it was nice to get some one-to-one time because it’s not often you get to do that with a Technical Director. It was nice to raise issues but for me, it was more of an opportunity to understand if I could trust you in the future with raising issues. Raising issues can be difficult and scary so it’s important to know if the person you are raising them to is receptive.”</li>
  <li>“It really showed that you cared about us as humans, and how we fit with the rest of the team. It was also a great opportunity to get to know you”</li>
  <li>“I think often of that conversation”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="did-it-make-them-feel-more-able-to-raise-issues-with-me">Did it make them feel more able to raise issues with me?</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantifiers are used to quantify how many times a part of your regular expression should be repeated. &nbsp;Every time you want to repeat something in a regex (an individual character, a character class or a sub-expression) you can write a quantifier after it to specify how many times it should be repeated.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following list shows some examples of the most common quantifiers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>?</strong></li>
<li><strong>*</strong></li>
<li><strong>+</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{,N}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N,}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N,M}</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article will only discuss these quantifiers within the context of Perl-like regular expressions (<em>not</em> POSIX regular expressions). &nbsp;This is worth mentioning since the older POSIX style regular expression quantifiers lack certain features, and have significantly different behaviour in some cases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most typical guides to regular expressions would probably start by immediately diving into a detailed description of what each of these symbols does. &nbsp;They would probably start by explaining the meaning of the '*', '+', and '?' symbols. &nbsp;However, <em><strong>this won't be your typical guide to regular expressions</strong></em>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we'll start by focusing on understanding this quantifier:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this atypical approach is simple: &nbsp;Once you understand what <em>this</em> quantifier does, you're already 50% done learning everything there is to know about quantifiers. &nbsp;Let's do a few examples.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume you need to write a regular expression that can match both spellings of the word 'enroll'. &nbsp;The word 'enroll' can sometimes be spelled with one 'l' or two 'l's depending on whether the author chooses to use British or American spelling conventions. &nbsp;Using this regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{1,2}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll be able to match both spellings of 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a link to an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=enrol%7B1%2C2%7D">interactive visualization of the regex enrol{1,2}</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the quantifier is the '{1,2}' part. &nbsp;The '{1,2}' quantifier can be interpreted in English to mean "Whatever came just before this quantifier, repeated anywhere from 1 to 2 times.". &nbsp;If you wanted to change the regex to also match any misspellings of 'enroll' that have 3 'l's, you could just change the upper bound of the range from 2 to 3:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{1,3}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, using the regex above, you can match all three spellings of the word 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
	<li>enrolll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could go even further and change the regex to include misspellings that don't have any 'l's at all, by decreasing the lower bound of the range 0:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{0,3}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the regex above, you can match these four (miss)spellings of the word 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enro</li>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
	<li>enrolll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern that this quantifier uses should now be a bit more obvious: &nbsp;Whenever we want specify that the previous character can be repeated a lower bound of N times up to an upper bound of M times, we can write this quantifier after the character:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the letters 'N' and 'M' here are placeholders that are used for the purposes of documentation. &nbsp;In reality, you would never literally write '{N,M}' as a quantifier in your regular expression. &nbsp;You would would write something like '{2,8}', '{0,20}' or any other pair of positive integers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make things crystal clear, there are a few cases where the endpoints of the range are not explicitly written, but are instead implied. &nbsp;Here is an example:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of this quantifier is to repeat the character 'a' anywhere from (it doesn't matter times) to 5 times. &nbsp;Another way to describe the same thing would be to say "repeat the character 'a' anywhere from 0 times to 5 times" which you could do with the following equivalent regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll sometimes see the same thing with the upper bound of the range:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{3,}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in these cases the upper end of the range is assumed to be "Infinity", however there is no equivalent way to write this explicitly. &nbsp;You simply can't write something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{3,Infinity} (This does not work)
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since most regex engines will default to interpreting the range quantifier as literal text if it doesn't see the format it expects. &nbsp;Therefore, when the upper bound of your range is 'infinity', you must simply omit the second number like this: '{3,}'.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final important case to consider is when a single number is used to describe that the previous character should be matched <em>exactly</em> the number of times specified. &nbsp;For example, this regex will match any sequence of <em>exactly</em> 4 'a' characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{4}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wanted to re-write this using a range, we could write:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{4,4}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which means the same thing.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the quantifiers we've reviewed so far, it should be clear that they can all be re-written in the following standardized form:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where</p>

<ul>
	<li>'N' is a positive integer.</li>
	<li>'M' is a positive integer OR left blank to represent 'infinity'.</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still haven't discussed the meaning of the '?', '*' and '+' quantifiers, so let's do that now:</p>

<ul>
	<li>'<strong>?</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{0,1}</strong>'.</li>
	<li>'<strong>*</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{0,}</strong>'.</li>
	<li>'<strong>+</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{1,}</strong>'.</li>
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%3F&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '?' quantifier</a> that makes the character 'a' optional. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph splits into two possible paths: &nbsp;One that skips the character 'a', and one that requires it. &nbsp;If one path fails, the regular expression engine simply backtracks to try the other path.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%2B&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '+' quantifier</a> that matches the character 'a' one or more times. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph starts by requiring an 'a' character. &nbsp;If there are no 'a' characters, it fails immediately. &nbsp;If there is at least one, control will split into two possible paths: &nbsp;One path goes back to try and get yet another 'a' character, and the other continues with the rest of the regex. &nbsp;By default, the regex engine will first try the path that consumes yet another 'a' character until there are no more in the search text.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a*&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '*' quantifier</a> that matches the character 'a' zero or more times. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph starts by splitting into two possible paths: &nbsp;One path immediately continues on with the rest of the regex, and the other attempts to consume an 'a' character. &nbsp;By default, this quantifier will first try the path that consumes an 'a' character. &nbsp;Once it fails to find another 'a' character, it will give up and continue on with the rest of the regex.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a table to summarize what we've learned so far:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Quantifier Symbol</td><td>Normalized As A Range</td><td>What It Really Means</td></tr>
		<tr><td>?</td><td>{0,1}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to 1 times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>*</td><td>{0,}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>+</td><td>{1,}</td><td>"Repeated from 1 to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N}</td><td>{N,N}</td><td>"Repeated from N to N times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{,N}</td><td>{0,N}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to N times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N,}</td><td>{N,}</td><td>"Repeated from N to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N,M}</td><td>{N,M}</td><td>"Repeated from N to M times."</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed previously, quantifiers can be used to specify how many times a character in your regular expression can be repeated:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you can also apply quantifiers to character classes too:</p>

<p><code><pre>[0-9]{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you could use this regular expression to match chapter titles in a book, regardless of how many digits are in the chapter number:</p>

<p><code><pre>[Cc]hapter [0-9]+
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most importantly, you can also apply a quantifier to a sub-expression to repeat a sequence of characters. &nbsp;For example this regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>(Hello){2,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will match any of the following strings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HelloHello</li>
	<li>HelloHelloHello</li>
	<li>HelloHelloHelloHello</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can even apply quantifiers to a sub-expression that contains an alternation. &nbsp;This regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>(cat|dog|bird){1,2}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will match any of the following strings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cat</li>
	<li>dog</li>
	<li>bird</li>
	<li>catcat</li>
	<li>catdog</li>
	<li>catbird</li>
	<li>dogcat</li>
	<li>dogdog</li>
	<li>dogbird</li>
	<li>birdcat</li>
	<li>birddog</li>
	<li>birdbird</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as promised earlier, you're already 50% done learning everything there is to know about quantifiers. &nbsp;There are many more quantifiers than what we've seen so far, but fortunately, there are only 4 fundamental aspects to every regular expression quantifier, and you'll understand them all by the end of this article. &nbsp;Here are those 4 aspects:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>1)  The minimum number of times it can match.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>2)  The maximum number of times it can match.</strong></li>
	<li>3)  Whether it prefers to match as many times as possible, or as few times as possible.</li>
	<li>4)  Whether it will disable backtracking or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as you can see, we've already covered the first two, so 2/4 = 50% done.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's cover item #3 from the list above: "Whether it prefers to match as many times as possible, or as few times as possible.". &nbsp;Consider a case where we want to match this regular expression:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{2,4}(aabbcc|bb)
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against this piece of text:</p>

<p><code><pre>aaaabbcc
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can follow through the matching process with an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%7B2%2C4%7D(aabbcc%7Cbb)&amp;the_subject=aaaabbcc">interactive visualization of the matching process for this regex here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the quantifier '{2,4}' can match the 'a' anywhere from 2 times to 4 times, and the text we're searching starts with 4 consecutive 'a's, it's ok for the regular …</p></div></div></div>

				<p>While I have nothing against Rust as such and keep writing my pet project in Rust, there are still some deficiencies I find preventing Rust from being a proper programming language. Here I’d like to present them and explain why I deem them as such even if not all of them have any impact on me.<br>
<span id="more-1971"></span></p>
<h3>Rust language problems</h3>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>Rust does not have a formal language specification</strong> and by that I mean that while some bits like grammar and objects are explained, there are no formal rules to describe what language features can and cannot be. If you’ve ever looked at ISO C standard you’ve seen that almost any entity there has three or four parts in the description: formal syntax, constraints (i.e. what is not allowed or what can’t be done with it), semantics (i.e. what it does, how it impacts the program, what implementation caveats are there), and there may be some examples to illustrate the points. The best close equivalent in Rust is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Rust Reference</a> and e.g. structure there is described in the following way: syntax (no objections there), definition in a form of “A struct is a nominal struct type defined with the keyword <code>struct</code>.”, examples, a brief mention of empty (or unit-like) structures in the middle of examples, and “The precise memory layout of a struct is not specified.” at the end. I understand that adding new features is more important than documenting them but this is lame.</p>
<p>A proper mature language (with 1.0 in its version) should have a formal specification that should be useful both for people developing compilers and the programmers trying to understand certain intricacies of the language and why it does not work as expected (more on that later). For example, for that <code>struct</code> definition I find lacking at least these: mentioning that you can have <code>impl</code> for it (even a reference would do—even if you have to repeat it for every type), split off tuples into a separate entry because it’s very different syntactically and raises a question why you have anonymous tuples and not anonymous structs (which you also can’t find from the documentation), and of course create proper layout so that rather important information (about memory layout for example) is not lost among examples.</p>
<p>And now to the specific problems I encounter quite often and I don’t know whether I understand it wrong or the compiler understands it wrong. And since there’s no formal specification I can’t tell which one it is (even if the former is most probable).</p>
<p><strong>Function/method calling convention.</strong> Here’s a simple example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
struct Foo { a: i32 }<br>
impl Foo { fn bar(&amp;mut self, val: i32) { self.a = val + 42; } }<br>
fn main() {<br>
&nbsp; let mut foo = Foo { a: 0 };<br>
&nbsp; foo.bar(foo.a);<br>
}
</p></blockquote>
<p>For now this won’t compile because of the borrowing but shouldn’t the compiler be smart enough to create a copy of <code>foo.a</code> before call? I’m not sure but IIRC current implementation first mutably borrows object for the call and only then tries to borrow the arguments. Is it really so and if yes, why? <em>Update:</em> I’m told that newer versions of the compiler handle it just fine but the question still stands (was it just a compiler problem or the call definition has been changed?).</p>
<p>The other thing is the old C caveat of function arguments evaluation. Here’s a simple example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
let mut iter = “abc”.chars();<br>
foo(iter.next().unwrap(), iter.next().unwrap(), iter.next().unwrap());
</p></blockquote>
<p>So would it be <code>foo('a','b','c')</code> or <code>foo('c','b','a')</code> call. In C it’s undefined because it depends on how arguments are passed on the current platform (consider yourself lucky if you don’t remember <code>__pascal</code> or <code>__stdcall</code>). In Rust it’s undefined because there’s no formal specification to tell you even that much. And it would be even worse if you consider that you may use the same source for indexing the caller object like <code>handler[iter.next().unwrap() as usize].process(iter.next().unwrap());</code> in some theoretical bytecode handler (of course it’s a horrible way to write code and you should use named temporary variables but it should illustrate the problem).</p>
<p>And another source of annoyance for me is <strong>traits</strong>. I have almost no problems with owning/lifetime/borrowing concepts but traits get me almost every time. I’m vaguely aware that the answer to why the following problems exist is “because traits are implemented as a call table” but again, <em>should</em> they be implemented like that and what should be the constraints on them (after all the original object should be somehow linked to the trait pointer). So when you have a supertrait (i.e. <code>trait Foo: Bar</code>) you can’t easily cast it for subtrait (e.g. <code>&amp;Foo -&gt; &amp;Bar</code>) without writing a lot of boilerplate code. And even worse if you convert an object into <code>Box&lt;trait&gt;</code> there’s no way to get the original object back (still in boxed form of course; I remember seeing a special crate that implements a lot of boilerplate code in order to get a mutable reference though). To reiterate: the problem is not me being stupid but rather the lack of formal description on how it’s done and why what I want is so hard. Then I’d probably at least be able to realize how I should change my code to work around the limitations.</p>
<h3><code>rustc</code> problems</h3>
<p>No, I’m not going to talk about compilation speed. It’s certainly a nuisance but not a problem per se. Here I want to point rather theoretical problems that a mature language should not have. And having just one compiler is one of those problems (call that problem zero).</p>
<p>First of all, <strong>bootstrapping process</strong> is laughably bad. I realize that it’s never too easy but if you call yourself a systems programming language you should be able to bootstrap a compiler in a sane amount of steps. For instance, IIRC <code>Guix</code> has the following bootstrapping process for C compiler: simple C complier in Scheme (for which you can often write an implementation in assembly by hand) compiles TCC, TCC compiles GCC 2.95, GCC 2.95 compiles GCC 3.7, GCC 3.7 compiles GCC 4.9. For <code>rustc</code> you should either start with the original compiler written in OCaml and compile every following version with the previous one (i.e. 1.17 with 1.16) or cheat by using <code>mrustc</code> written in C++ which can compile Rust 1.19 or 1.29 (without borrow checks), then compile 1.30 with 1.29, 1.31 with 1.30 etc etc. The problem here is that you cannot skip versions and e.g. compile <code>rustc 1.46</code> with <code>rustc 1.36</code> (I’d be happy to learn that I’m wrong). IMO you should have maybe an ineffective compiler but written in a dialect that much older compiler should understand i.e. <code>rustc 1.0</code> should be able to compile a compiler for 1.10, which can be used to compile 1.20 and so forth. Of course it’s a huge waste of resources for rather theoretical problem but it may prove beneficial for compiler design itself.</p>
<p>Then there’s <strong>LLVM dependency.</strong> I understand that <code>LLVM</code> provides many advantages (like no need to worry about code generation for many platforms and optimising it) but it gives some disadvantages too. First, you don’t have a really self-hosting compiler (a theoretical problem but still a thing worth thinking about; also consider that you have to rely on a framework developed mostly by large corporations mostly in their own interests). Second, you’re limited by what it does e.g. I read complaints about debug builds being too slow mostly because of LLVM backend. And I suspect it still can’t do certain kinds of memory-related optimisations because it was designed with C++ compiler in mind which still has certain quirks regarding multiple memory access (plus IIRC there was one LLVM bug triggered by an infinite loop in Rust code that’s perfectly valid there but not according to C++ rules). I’m aware that <code>cranelift</code> exists (and Rust front-end for <code>GCC</code>) so hopefully this will be improved.</p>
<p>And finally there’s a thing related to the previous problem. Rust has poor <strong>support for assembly</strong>. Of course not so many people need standalone assembly and not inline one (which is still lacking but <code>asm!</code> is almost there) but languages oriented for systems programming support compiling assembly in addition to the higher-language code so it would be <em>proper</em> to support assembly files even with not so rich preprocessor syntax as GAS has. Fiddling with <code>build.rs</code> to invoke an external assembler is possible but not nice at all.</p>
<h3>Other Rust language problems</h3>
<p>There’s also one problem with Rust <code>std</code> library that I should mention too. It’s useless for interfacing OS. Now if I want to do something natural to any UNIX system I need to at least import <code>libc</code> crate <del datetime="2020-09-19T03:32:25+00:00">and link against an external libc</del> (it’s part of the runtime anyway). One solution would be that crate I heard of that wanted to translate <code>musl</code> into Rust so you can at least eliminate the linking step. But the proper solution would be to support at least OS-specific syscall() in <code>std</code> crate as many interesting libc functions are just a wrapper over it (like <code>open()</code>/<code>write()</code>/<code>ioctl()</code>; Windows is a different beast so I don’t mind if it’s <code>std::os::unix::syscall</code> and not something more common).</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m not a Rust language architect and I’m extremely unlikely to become one but I have an opinion on what Rust lacks in order to become a proper mature language really fit for systems development (three things essentially: being fully self-hosted, having a specification, and being able to interface low-level stuff without resorting to C compiler or assembler). Hopefully this will be rectified despite the lack of Mozilla.</p>

  <p>Like so many things I’m supposed to do but don’t — getting exercise, eating right, sleeping well, standing up for women and minorities in public spaces — backing up my data has always been something I’ve half-assed at best.</p>
<p>I’ve lugged around an external hard drive with a few hundred gigabytes of data for the last 10 years, and made backups to it once every three or four years or so. Every time I’ve tried restoring anything from those backups I’ve regretted it, because of course I just bought the drive, plugged it in and copied stuff to it, so it is a FAT32 drive while I have mostly had EXT4 filesystems, which means all my file permissions get lost during the process.</p>
<p>I’ve written shameful little shell scripts to set file permissions to 0644 and directory permissions to 0755, recursively, many many times.</p>
<p>Part of my problem was that I both know just enough rsync to be dangerous and have a credit card so I can provision cloud VMs, so forever just around the corner was my perfect backup solution that I’d write myself and maintain and actually do instead of dealing with whatever I had going on in my life. I’ve come to accept that this will never happen, or perhaps more definitively, that I’d rather cut myself than write and maintain another piece of ad-hoc software for myself.</p>
<p>Luckily I recently found two things that have solved this whole problem for me: <a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">borg</a> and <a href="https://www.rsync.net/">rsync.net</a>.</p>
<p>Borg is backup software. It compresses and deduplicates data at the block level, and strongly encourages (but does not force) you to encrypt data before backing it up. It is everything I’d want from my half-assed rsync and shell script abomination.</p>
<p>I read its documentation a couple of times and was impressed. I then set about comparing different VM hosts to see which one would give me the cheapest block storage option, when the result of some <a href="https://github.com/scotte/borgsnap">random google search</a> led me to rsync.net. They are a company that stores backups, pretty cheaply, and <a href="http://www.rsync.net/products/attic.html">even more cheaply</a> if you use borg to take them. I guess they just really love borg and want us to love it too.</p>
<p>I signed up for their cheapest plan, which starts at 100GB stored for $18 per year. They have no network in- or egress costs, and the storage amount can be adjusted at any time. Once my account had been activated, I did a little password reset dance, and uploaded a public SSH key.</p>
<p>I wanted to back up my <code>$HOME</code> directory, so after installing borg I ran:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>export BORG_REMOTE_PATH="borg1"
borg init --encryption repokey-blake2 UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This created a remote borg repository called "home" on rsync.net’s servers. The environment variable is so we use a more recent version of borg on the remote server (version 1.1.11 at the time of writing), as the default version is rather old (version 0.29.0).</p>
<p>When choosing what encryption method to use, one can choose between a "repokey" or a "keyfile". They both create a private key locked with a passphrase; the difference is that with "repokey" the key is stored in the borg repo, while with "keyfile" it is stored outside of it. This boils down to whether we think a passphrase is enough security for our data, or whether we think having a secret keyfile is necessary. I figured my password manager could create a strong enough passphrase for my needs, and I didn’t want to think about losing the keyfile, so I chose "repokey-blake2".</p>
<p>To create my first backup, I ran</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>borg create --exclude "$HOME/.cache" UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home::backup-1 "$HOME"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>which created the archive "backup-1" in my "home" borg repository. I didn’t change the compression algorithm from the default one.</p>
<p>By default borg compresses data with lz4. It can use other compression methods (xz, zlib, zstd). I compared their compression ratios on some binary files I had and found no difference between them. I think this is because the large binary files I have are mostly audio and video files in lossy formats, which don’t seem to benefit very much from further compression. I have a lot of text files as well, but text takes up so little relative space on today’s hardware that it makes no sense to spend CPU cycles on compressing it better than lz4 does.</p>
<p>This backup command hummed along for a good while, and through a couple of reboot cycles. Doing a second backup right after it finished (or the day after) took a lot less time because of the deduplication:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>borg create --exclude "$HOME/.cache" UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home::backup-2 "$HOME"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Restoring from backup is also easy:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>borg extract UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home::backup-2</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I set this up to run as a daily timed systemd service at noon (very easy on NixOS, which every Linux user should be using unless they hate themselves), and will never, ever think about this again. For a handful of bucks a year, that is a good deal.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is the first in a three-part series about my recent work on
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a>
as part of my day job at Mozilla. In this first post, I will set some context
and describe the instruction selection problem. In particular, I’ll talk about
a revamp to the instruction selector and backend framework in general that
we’ve been working on for the last nine months or so. This work has been
co-developed with my brilliant colleagues Julian Seward and <a href="https://benj.me/">Benjamin
Bouvier</a>, with significant early input from <a href="https://github.com/sunfishcode">Dan
Gohman</a> as well, and help from all of the
wonderful Cranelift hackers.</p>

<h2 id="background-cranelift">Background: Cranelift</h2>

<p>So what is Cranelift? The project is a compiler framework written in
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> that is designed especially (but not
exclusively) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">just-in-time
compilation</a>. It’s a
general-purpose compiler: its most popular use-case is to compile
<a href="https://www.webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, though several other frontends
exist, for example,
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cg_clif</a>, which adapts the
Rust compiler itself to use Cranelift. Folks at Mozilla and several other
places have been developing the compiler for a few years now.  It is the
default compiler backend for
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">wasmtime</a>, a runtime for
WebAssembly outside the browser, and is used in production in several other
places as well. We recently flipped the switch to turn on Cranelift-based
WebAssembly support in nightly Firefox on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64">ARM64
(AArch64)</a> machines, including most
smartphones, and if all goes well, it will eventually go out in a stable
Firefox release. Cranelift is developed under the umbrella of the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode
Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>In the past nine months, we have built a new framework in Cranelift for the
“machine backends”, or the parts of the compiler that support particular CPU
instruction sets. We also added a new backend for AArch64, mentioned above, and
filled out features as needed until Cranelift was ready for production use in
Firefox. This blog post sets some context and describes the design process that
went into the backend-framework revamp.</p>

<p>It can be a bit confusing to keep all of the moving parts straight. Here’s a
visual overview of Cranelift’s place among various other components, focusing
on two of the major Rust crates (the Wasm frontend and the codegen backend) and
several of the other programs that make use of Cranelift:</p>

<h2 id="old-backend-design-instruction-legalizations">Old Backend Design: Instruction Legalizations</h2>

<p>To understand the work that we’ve done recently on Cranelift, we’ll need to
zoom into the <code>cranelift_codegen</code> crate above and talk about how it <em>used to</em>
work. What is this “CLIF” input, and how does the compiler translate it to
machine code that the CPU can execute?</p>

<p>Cranelift makes use of
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/ir.md">CLIF</a>,
or the Cranelift IR (Intermediate Representation) Format, to represent the code
that it is compiling. Every compiler that performs program optimizations uses
some form of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">Intermediate Representation
(IR)</a>: you can think
of this like a virtual instruction set that can represent all the operations a
program is allowed to do. The IR is typically simpler than real instruction
sets, designed to use a small set of well-defined instructions so that the
compiler can easily reason about what a program means. The IR is also
independent of the CPU architecture that the compiler eventually targets; this
lets much of the compiler (such as the part that generates IR from the input
programming language, and the parts that optimize the IR) be reused whenever
the compiler is adapted to target a new CPU architecture.  CLIF is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Static
Single Assignment
(SSA)</a> form, and
uses a conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">control-flow
graph</a> with basic blocks
(though it previously allowed extended basic blocks, these have been phased
out). Unlike many SSA IRs, it represents φ-nodes with block parameters
rather than explicit φ-instructions.</p>

<p>Within <code>cranelift_codegen</code>, before we revamped the backend design, the program
remained in CLIF throughout compilation and up until the compiler emitted the
final machine code. This might seem to contradict what we just said: how can
the IR be machine-independent, but also be the final form from which we emit
machine code?</p>

<p>The answer is that the old backends were built around the concept of
“legalization” and “encodings”. At a high level, the idea is that every
<em>Cranelift</em> instruction either corresponds to one <em>machine</em> instruction, or can
be replaced by a sequence of other <em>Cranelift</em> instructions. Given such a
mapping, we can refine the CLIF in steps, starting from arbitrary
machine-independent instructions from earlier compiler stages, performing edits
until the CLIF corresponds 1-to-1 with machine code. Let’s visualize this
process:</p>

<p><img src="https://cfallin.org/assets/2020-09-10-cranelift-legalization.svg" alt="Figure: legalization by repeated instruction expansion"></p>

<p>A very simple example of a CLIF instruction that has a direct “encoding” to a
machine instruction is <code>iadd</code>, which just adds two integers. On essentially any
modern architecture, this should map to a simple ALU instruction that adds two
registers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many CLIF instructions do not map cleanly. Some arithmetic
instructions fall into this category: for example, there is a CLIF instruction
to count the number of set bits in an integer’s binary representation
(<code>popcount</code>); not every CPU has a single instruction for this, so it might be
expanded into a longer series of bit manipulations. There are operations that
are defined at a higher semantic level, as well, that will necessarily be
lowered with expansions: for example, accesses to Wasm memories are lowered
into operations that fetch the linear memory base and its size, bounds-check
the Wasm address against the limit, compute the real address for the Wasm
address, and perform the access.</p>

<p>To compile a function, then, we iterate over the CLIF and find instructions
with no direct machine encodings; for each, we simply expand into the legalized
sequence, and then recursively consider the instructions in that sequence. We
loop until all instructions have machine encodings. At that point, we can emit
the bytes corresponding to each instruction’s encoding<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="growing-pains-and-a-new-backend-framework">Growing Pains, and a New Backend Framework?</h2>

<p>There are a number of advantages to the legacy Cranelift backend design, which
performs expansion-based legalization with a single IR throughout. As one might
expect, though, there are also a number of drawbacks. Let’s discuss a few of
each.</p>

<h3 id="single-ir-and-legalization-pros">Single IR and Legalization: Pros</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>By operating on a single IR all the way to machine-code emission, the same
optimizations can be applied at multiple stages. For example, consider a
legalization expansion that turns a high-level “access Wasm memory”
instruction into a sequence of loads, adds and bounds-checks. If many such
sequences occur in one function, we might be able to factor out common
portions (e.g.: computing the base of the Wasm memory).  Thus the
legalization scheme exposes as much code as possible, at as many stages as
possible, to opportunities for optimization. The legacy Cranelift pipeline
in fact works in this way: it runs “pre-opt” and “post-opt” optimization
passes, before and after legalization respectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <em>most</em> of the Cranelift instructions become one machine instruction, and
few legalizations are necessary, then this scheme can be very fast: it
becomes simply a single traversal to fill in “encodings”, which were
represented by small indices into a table.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="single-ir-and-legalization-cons">Single IR and Legalization: Cons</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Expansion-based legalization may not always result in
optimal code. So far we’ve seen that legalization can convert from CLIF to
machine instructions with one-to-one or one-to-many mappings. However, there
are sometimes also <em>single</em> machine instructions that implement the behavior of
<em>multiple</em> CLIF instructions, i.e. a many-to-one mapping. In order to generate
efficient code, we want to be able to make use of these instructions.</p>

    <p>For example, on x86, an instruction that references memory can compute an
address like <code>base + scale * index</code>, where <code>base</code> and <code>index</code> are registers
and <code>scale</code> is 1, 2, 4, or 8. There is no notion of such an address mode in
CLIF, so we would want to pattern-match the raw <code>iadd</code> (add) and <code>ishl</code>
(shift) or <code>imul</code> (multiply) operations when they occur in the address
computation. Then, we would want to somehow select the encoding on the
<code>load</code> instruction based on the fact that its input is some specific
combination of adds and shifts/multiplies.  This seems to break the
abstraction that the encoding represents only that instruction’s operation.</p>

    <p>In principle, we could implement more general pattern matching for legalization
rules to allow many-to-one mappings. However, this would be a significant
refactor; and as long as we were reconsidering the design in whole, there were
other reasons to avoid patching the problem in this way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a conceptual difficulty with the single-IR approach: there is
no static representation of which instructions are expanded into which others
and it is difficult to reason about the correctness and termination properties
of legalization as a whole.</p>

    <p>Specifically, the expansion-based legalization rules must obey a partial
order among instructions: if A expands into a sequence including B, then B
cannot later expand into A. In practice, mappings were mostly one-to-one,
and for those that weren’t, there was a clear domain separation between the
“input” high-level instructions and the “machine-level” instructions.
However, for more complex machines, or more complex matching schemes that
attempt to make better use of the target instruction set, this could become
a real difficulty for the machine-backend author to keep straight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are efficiency concerns with expansion-based legalization. At
an algorithmic level, we prefer to avoid fixpoint loops (in this case,
“continue expanding until no more expansions exist”) whenever possible. The
runtime is bounded, but the bound is somewhat difficult to reason about,
because it depends on the maximum depth of chained expansions.</p>

    <p>The data structures that enable in-place editing are also much slower than
we would like. Typically, compilers store IR instructions in linked lists to
allow for in-place editing. …</p></li></ol></div></article></div></div></div>

<section name="3648"><div><div><h3 name="8f02" id="8f02">Small Computing and the Security&nbsp;Mindset</h3><p name="3181" id="3181">The story of modern computing is the story of the big-computing mindset (scale, centralization, elitism, and paternalism) infecting everything it touches as programming becomes more of a profession than a craft. In the process, it creates edifices of practices — useful in big-computing situations — that get unthinkingly applied outside of their appropriate bounds, forcing small-computing projects into the strictures of big-computing design. One major domain where we must begin to think critically about the big- vs small-computing distinction is security.</p><p name="46d1" id="46d1">Small-computing systems ought to be secure. After all, they are our most personal environments! They are our diaries and our artworks and our dream journals! But computer security, as it has become professionalized, has become more and more focused on big-computing environments, and good security practices in those environments are inimical to the basic tenets of small computing.</p><p name="369b" id="369b">In a big-computing environment, valuable secrets (like credit card numbers) and desirable powers (like the ability to tweet on behalf of the president) are kept on a set of machines owned by a single entity (the corporation) on behalf of the ostensible owners of that information and power (particular end-users) and protected from illegitimate access (hacking/cracking) by an elite set of professionals (software engineers, ops teams, security consultants) who use their monopoly on legitimate access to certain power (superuser &amp; administrator privileges, commit access) to construct laws (security policies) that prohibit as many not-explicitly-allowed operations as possible. Because the adversaries are many, with infinite time and energy, and because the treasure is valuable, and because laws always have unseen loopholes, these elite professionals construct layers upon layers of rules to limit not only what users (legitimate or illegitimate) can do, but what kind of feedback they can receive.</p><p name="c145" id="c145">This mentality has even made its way into language design: Java (and C++) have a rudimentary form of access control where members can be marked private, and good style in these languages is to mark all member data as private and write accessor functions, ostensibly in order to perform validity checks on proposed modification. This boilerplate is added rather than doing the sensible thing and creating custom metatables such that assignments are implicitly passed through an integrity check (as may be done in Python and Lua). Of course, such checks are rarely implemented, and they cannot distinguish between ‘authorized’ and ‘unauthorized’ calling-classes anyhow — while C++ has ‘friend classes’ that can modify private data directly, and both support using inheritance hierarchies to control data access, there is no granularity smaller than kin/friend versus outsider, so these access controls are borderline useless for everything besides the ad-hoc plugging failures of the type system and increasing the line count of codebases.</p><p name="c4c2" id="c4c2">Systems that require big-computing style security exist. Problems that are best suited to those systems also exist — your bank ought to not only have big-computing style security, but ought to have substantially better security than it has. But, this model is not really sensible in many of the places it is used. For instance, Google Docs (which simulates a word processor with some limited support for simultaneous editing by multiple users) is locked into this model only because it is client-server, and a hypothetical local-first or peer-to-peer version should not be so professionalized and stratified; Microsoft Word, being a local application, has no legitimate excuse (though the real reason, as with most big-computing systems, is that unnecessary centralization is a very effective way to squeeze money out of users who don’t know any better).</p><p name="d95a" id="d95a">When I use Google Docs, I can modify the javascript running on my browser, modify the cookies being sent to the server, and modify URL parameters. If I do something wrong, I will get an entirely unhelpful error message from inside the black box of the remote server. This is because, by failing to fall precisely in line with the Alphabet Corporation’s desired behavior, I have become an adversary, and adversaries cannot be given information that might help them do whatever they might want to do (since some of the things they might want to do is get, for instance, the credit card numbers of everyone who has ever bought an advertisement). Of course, Google engineers writing and maintaining Google Docs face the same situation. Outside of an adversarial situation, investigating a poorly-understood piece of code by poking it and interpreting error messages is called debugging, and part of the small computing ethos is that users should not be prevented from debugging.</p><p name="05d7" id="05d7">The difference between big computing and small computing is, in essence, that in small computing, the user is never an adversary. This is because the running code is owned and controlled by the user. This goes beyond open source / free software (where the developer is no adversary, but the developer is an elite professional often working on behalf of a corporation inside a firewall, performing work that may well be detrimental to those who actually need to interact with its effects).</p><p name="bd41" id="bd41">What kinds of structures befit a small-computing system in an environment where networking exists, and what security models are appropriate for these structures?</p><p name="8df4" id="8df4">For one thing, a multi-user client-server model makes no sense. In a client-server model, whoever controls the single server functionally controls all clients. There is, therefore, incentive to hoard power by locking vital functionalities away on the shared server, making every client dependent — slowed by latency when online, shit out of luck when offline, and always under threat of sudden unilateral changes in policy or protocol.</p><p name="d853" id="d853">Instead, we should look to peer to peer systems: direct for real-time communication, and offline-first store-and-forward schemes for everything else. Asymmetric encryption for key exchange and for signing still make sense here, as does hash-based content addressing for storage. Secure Scuttlebutt and IPFS are good models for what small-computing-oriented network technologies of the future might look like: fully distributed, yet resistant to the kinds of threats that regularly take down federated systems like ActivityPub and IRC, because all nodes are equal and all nodes replicate for each other (under cryptographically-enforced anti-spoofing measures).</p><p name="32c0" id="32c0">What does a threat model for small-computing infrastructure look like?</p><p name="2535" id="2535">Well, unlike in big-computing systems, a small-computing system does not (typically) have large numbers of highly motivated dedicated attackers. Fuzzy Bear isn’t APTing your grandma’s laptop, because your grandma’s laptop has nothing on it but christmas MIDIs and questionable nudes. Our threat is really from folks doing large-scale automated sweeps for low-hanging fruit. So, small-computing threat modeling looks like everyday opsec: use encryption, don’t give strangers direct access to private spaces and limit the spaces they do have access to, distinguish between sensitive and non-sensitive data, and protect the integrity of the system from outsiders. Protect the network-facing portion of your machine, while maximizing your own access to it.</p><p name="aa5a" id="aa5a">In this context, technologies we absolutely do not need are: passwords, SSO, certificate authority hierarchies, name servers and host files, NAT firewalls, code signing, chroot jails, memory layout randomizers, executable symbol stripping, single-application containers, daemons running as ‘nobody’, web APIs for wrapping the web APIs around your web APIs, friend classes, and sudo.</p><p name="9477" id="9477">Technologies we might want to look into: distributed hash tables, chord routing, merkel trees, functional languages, JIT, fast copy-on-write, network-aware cache eviction policies, split-brain countermeasures, transitive blocking, store and forward, message passing, microversioning, journaling, and image-based environments.</p></div></div></section>

"We will continue to challenge the unjust executive order, which was enacted without due process and threatens to deprive the American people and small businesses across the U.S. of a significant platform for both a voice and livelihoods."</p>  <p>The Commerce Department order will "de-platform" the two apps in the U.S. and bar Apple Inc's app store, Alphabet Inc's Google Play and others from offering the apps on any platform "that can be reached from within the United States," a senior Commerce official told Reuters.</p>  <p>The order will not ban U.S. companies from doing business&nbsp;on WeChat outside the United States, which will be welcome news to U.S. firms like Walmart and Starbucks that use WeChat's embedded "mini-app"&nbsp;programs to facilitate transactions and engage consumers in China, officials said.</p>    <p>The order will not bar transactions with WeChat-owner Tencent Holdings' other businesses, including its online gaming operations, and will not prohibit Apple, Google or others from offering TikTok or WeChat apps anywhere outside the United States.</p>  <p>The bans are in response to a pair of executive orders issued by Trump on Aug.&nbsp;6 that gave the Commerce Department 45 days to determine what transactions to block from the apps he deemed pose a national security threat. That deadline expires on Sunday.</p>  <h2>'Untrusted'&nbsp;Chinese apps</h2>  <p>The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to purge "untrusted" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks and has called TikTok and WeChat&nbsp;"significant threats."</p>  <p>TikTok has 100 million users in the United States and is especially popular among younger Americans.</p>  <p>WeChat has had an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States, analytics firm&nbsp;Apptopia said in early August.

The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users.</p>  <p>The Commerce Department will not seek to compel people in the United States to remove the apps or stop using them but will not allow updates or new downloads. "We are aiming at a top corporate level. We're not going to go out after the individual users," one Commerce official said.</p>  <p>Over time, officials said, the lack of updates will degrade the apps' usability.</p>  <p>"The expectation is that people will find alternative ways to do these actions," a senior official said. "We expect the market to act and there will be more secure apps that will fill in these gaps that Americans can trust and that the United States government won't have to take similar actions against."</p>    <p>The Commerce Department is also barring additional technical transactions with WeChat starting Sunday that will significantly reduce the usability and functionality of the app in the United States.</p>  <p>The order bars data hosting within the United States for WeChat, content delivery services and networks that can increase functionality and internet transit or peering services.</p>  <p>"What immediately is going to happen is users are going to experience a lag or lack of functionality," a senior Commerce official said of WeChat users. "It may still be usable but it is not going to be as functional as it was." There may be sporadic outages as well, the official said.</p>  <p>Commerce will bar the same set of technical transactions for TikTok, but that will not take effect until Nov. 12 to give the company additional time to see if ByteDance can reach a deal for its U.S. operations.

<h3>
  18 September 2020
</h3>


  <p>In a few months, I’ll celebrate my fifth year as a professional - understand paid - software engineer. I find this role to be a right balance of technical skills, human relationships and it fulfils my curiosity. As time goes by, I’m also starting to be disappointed by some of its negative aspects. While it doesn’t prevent me from sleeping, I think an effort could be made to challenge some lousy and short-sighted comments we see daily on social platforms.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to talk about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>, a book written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, famously known as the <em>Gang of Four</em>. If you never read it: this is a fundamental programming book describing programming abstractions published in 1994. The date is essential here, but we’ll come to that later.</p>
<p>This book has recently been discussed by many, due to <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1306581616983183361">a recent tweet from Robert. C. Martin aka Uncle Bob</a>. Long story short, telling a massive audience that book X is great, and treating people who consider it outdated as “foolish” does not end well.</p>
<p>While I disagree with the tone here, I’d like to focus on the negative comments which followed, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the book is outdated</li>
<li>its concepts are outdated</li>
<li>its authors said it’s outdated</li>
<li>the book is only focused on mid-90s C++ developers</li>
<li>no one ever used the “flyweight” design pattern</li>
<li>the book is not even readable</li>
<li>its abstractions make code unreadable</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, let’s get back to 1994. I was two at the time. All Internet websites could probably fit on a floppy disk, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, Rasmus Lerdorf was only starting to work on its <em>Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter</em> CGI C program, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin would only start their research project for a web search engine two years later. The biggest technology companies were IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and Xerox, which mostly sat behind the oil, car, and food industries. Programming existed, but it wasn’t the same field as we know it today. Tech companies were a few, and I assume a lot of programmers were working in other industries. Being a professional in this sector was arguably more difficult then, and knowledge was not as easily accessible as it is today. This book was published in a world where programming started to spread in many industries. It surely was a very good resource, to try to apply its concepts, and see what works and what doesn’t. The authors were literally inventing the field at the time: Erich Gamma, for instance, teamed up with Kent Beck to create the Java JUnit test framework just a few years later, which hugely helped to popularise testing.</p>
<p>My point is: let’s remind ourselves we stand on the shoulders of many people who tried and experimented a lot at the time. We too often take for granted the knowledge and productivity we have today. On top of that, let’s not be disrespectful towards the previous generation. My father and my grandfather both work(ed) as electricians: never did my father complain about his father’s tools or habits before him. He learned them and perfected them with modern knowledge.</p>
<p>Now about the book in itself. While I agree with people saying that some design patterns are too abstract, I strongly disagree with the ones saying the whole book is outdated. Should you develop in a OO language today, such as Java, C++, Python or Ruby, or even more notably, develop a framework or a tool <em>for</em> developers, I think this book is still highly relevant today.</p>
<p>Here are my top picks from the book and why I chose them.</p>
<p><strong>Builder:</strong> because in OOP, objects often hold too much data in them, you need to control how to instantiate them properly. Even with overloaded constructors, data validation at instantiation can become messy. Do you like your testing framework using a <em>fluent interface</em> with method chaining (<code>assert(...).not().equalTo(...)</code>)? Guess what, it’s directly inspired by the builder design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype:</strong> I often hear people complaining about how complicated JavaScript is. While I don’t think this language makes it easy for the developer to write non error-prone code, I better understood the language via the lens of its prototype-based nature, precisely described by the prototype design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the structural patterns:</strong> While everyone is focused on the bad parts of OOP, namely inheritance, all those design patterns are focused on composability. If you want to be cool nowadays, you could say you prefer “composition over inheritance”. Well, if you think composition is only about embedding objects in each other, you should read the part of structural design patterns. For instance, you probably know decorators from Python or annotations in Java/C#, they derive from the decorator design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Chain of Responsibility:</strong> I think we can all agree on how great it is to use and implement a middleware in our modern web framework. Just use or write functions which take a <em>next</em> handler, a request object. Pass it to your web framework instance via a <code>.use(...)</code> method and you’re done. This is what the Chain of Responsibility pattern is all about. All Rails, Django, and Laravel developers knew that was NIH.</p>
<p><strong>Iterator:</strong> This one seems obvious now, perhaps not so much at a time where iterating on arrays with pointer arithmetic was common. Today, iterators are even buried behind standard libraries to implement even higher abstract functionalities, but they are still there. I don’t see a more universal way to implement, with the same public API, a traversal of an array, a tree, or a graph (they are better ways of iterating those last data structures though).</p>
<p><strong>Observer:</strong> For this last one, here is the verbatim definition from the book: “Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically”. Now, if we take a look at some modern technologies, doesn’t this resonate with PubSub models or React hooks for instance?</p>
<p>To conclude, I’m not saying the book is not old, quite the opposite: you can feel it when it takes as examples from 90s user interfaces. I’m merely advocating that our industry and its workers have changed a lot in the last 30 years, dare I say even more than in any other industry. But this should not be an excuse to sweep away years of meticulous R&amp;D and documentation, on which our modern tools still rely on nowadays, and the people behind it.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people complained that they were never able to finish the book, here is an extract from the end, section “What to Expect from Design Patterns”, page 351:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s possible to argue that this book hasn’t accomplished much. After all, it doesn’t present any algorithms or programming techniques that haven’t been used before. […] it just documents existing designs. You could conclude that it makes a reasonable tutorial, perhaps, but it certainly can’t offer much to an experienced object-oriented designer.</p>
<p>We hope you think differently. Cataloging design patterns is important. It gives us standard names and definitions for the techniques we use. If we don’t study design patterns in software, we won’t be able to improve them, and it’ll be harder to come up with new ones.</p>
<p>This book is only a start.</p>
</blockquote>
