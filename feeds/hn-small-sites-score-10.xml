<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Sunday morning while I was scrolling through my Twitter feed one tweet caught my eye,</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaScript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JavaScript</a> Challenge:</p><p>Can you make a TO-DO app within a single Tweet? (280 chars)</p><p>The app should be able to add tasks, strike-through finished tasks &amp; clear all tasks.</p><p>Any general-purpose library is allowed.<br>Starting HTML body should be empty except the &lt;script&gt;.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JS</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#code</a></p></div>— Dumi (@dumindaxsb) <a href="https://twitter.com/dumindaxsb/status/1340539549890404354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>The challenge was to make a todo app that fits in a single tweet, just like any other todo app, you should be able to add or remove tasks and clear the task list. I thought how hard this can get, I thought to myself this is doable just by using plain JavaScript.</p>
<p>So since I don’t have a laptop, what resulted was a whole day of torture having to code though my iPad on codepen.</p>
<h2><strong>Plain JavaScript</strong> </h2>
<p>Soon after I started using plain JavaScript it became obvious that I was not able to make it within one tweet, the DOM manipulation was taking too much characters<em>, document.createElements, document.getElements. </em></p>
<p>It was obvious that was not the right approach.</p>
<h2>Using vue</h2>
<p>Vue framework won’t require any build tools, so I don’t have to go through setting up Webpack,</p>
<p>Also I can easily create the DOM within the script tag using simple HTML. So that will save some characters for me in DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The first version I made use the <em>method</em> option in Vue app to handle button clicks, the button click event will call the function in methods to add new tasks and clear the task list.</p>
<p>However, I was unable to reduce it to one tweet. Then I went back to in-line functions, the same methods were added to button click events inline and not within the <em>methods</em> section.</p>
<p>Also I had to change buttons to anchor tags, in order to save some characters, and I had to use emojis instead of button text to save some more characters.</p>
<p>I also had to drop few buttons like a button to add a task, and instead I had to go with pressing enter key to add a task instead.</p>
<p>So I made the final version, the JavaScript code looked like this, </p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>Then I ran the code through an online JavaScript minifier and then the whole HTML though an HTML minifier, and ended up with this piece of code,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://ruky.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="aadcdfcfeac4cfd2de">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input @keyup.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a @click="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a @click="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With my fingers crossed, I copied the code on to Twitter, and guess what it fits perfectly inside a single Tweet.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=<a href="https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ">https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input <a href="https://twitter.com/keyup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@keyup</a>.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</p>— Rukshan (@JustRuky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustRuky/status/1340862545322762240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>And here is the code in action, <a href="https://jsbin.com/venihiliha/1/edit?html,output">link</a> </p>
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<h2>What I failed to achieve </h2>
<p>The original Tweet says, that the completed tasks should have a strike through.</p>
<p>But because css was costing me too much characters I had to fall back to remove completed tasks instead, but I’m sure someone will figure a solution for that as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think you can save even more characters by using <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>, because you have short-codes for DOM elements as well, but I haven’t tried mithril in awhile.</p>
<h4>One last thing</h4>
<p>No I didn’t waste my whole Sunday on this problem, but I had to spend few hours, thinking and trying different versions. </p>
<p>I would have cut back some more time if I had a laptop. Somerimes I feel like buying an old laptop and refurbishing it and installing Ubuntu on it.</p>
<p>Sunday well spent? Absolutely yes.</p>
<h2>Best answer?</h2>
<p>One thing I love about HN is the fact that there are lot of bright minds out there. Since I posted this on HN I knew it was just a matter of time since someone figures this out.</p>
<p>I guess this is the best answer and also ticks all the boxes, well done.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;script&gt;document.write(`&lt;style&gt;:checked+*{text-decoration:line-through}#t{display:none}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;p id="t"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;&lt;input&gt;&lt;div id="f"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.appendChild(t.cloneNode(true)).id=''"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.innerHTML=''"&gt;×&lt;/button&gt;`)&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<![CDATA[Modeling TLA+ in Z3Py (2020)]]>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It’s that time of year again where I’m fiddling around with Z3Py. I’m booting it back up because I’m scheduled to do a <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/agenda.html">tutorial on Z3</a> on Feb 3. It’s kind of silly because I probably already have too much content, and the tutorial is aimed at newbies, but there are some fun new things that I’ve learned in the last year I can do in Z3. As one example, it’s not so hard to build a pretty reasonable simulacrum of TLA+ in Z3.</p>

<p><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> is a modelling/specification language for computational processes. It is particularly useful for modeling concurrency, where our intuitions fail us <a href="http://deadlockempire.github.io/">http://deadlockempire.github.io/</a>. It’s the mind child of Leslie Lamport, the same guy behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. The language doesn’t aim for deep verification of your actual code as is sometimes the goal with tools like Coq, but because of that it is significantly more lightweight and easy to use. 
The <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html">TLA+ Toolbox</a> is a freely available IDE and checker to TLA+, but I think it is kind of a neat idea to replicate something in the flavor of TLA+ in all too familiar python. By leveraging Z3, we can get a lot of logical mileage and solver power for free.</p>

<p><a href="https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial">Z3</a> is an SMT solver. Its input language <a href="http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/examples.shtml">smtlib2</a> is a kind of typed first order logic with special support for things like booleans, integers, reals, bitvectors, and algebraic datatypes. You can ask Z3 if propositions are valid, or if not it can provide a counterexample. It works pretty crazy good, especially if you work around its weaknesses (mostly quantifiers and nasty nonlinear stuff). Z3 has top class performance and its <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/namespacez3py.html">python bindings</a> are widely regarded as very good.</p>

<p>The main unusual things TLA brings into play compared to bog standard logics is the primed variables \(x'\), representing the values of variables at the next time step, and some temporal operators like always \(\Box\) and eventually \(\Diamond\).</p>

<p>We could mark primes by creating variables in pairs</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>z3</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>xnxt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ints</span><span>(</span><span>"x x'"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I’ve chosen to mark the prime variables using a special uninterpreted function, which we strip out later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>nxt</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span># next is a special function for generators in python, so we shouldn't use that name
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>is_const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>decl</span><span>().</span><span>kind</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>Z3_OP_UNINTERPRETED</span><span>:</span>
    <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>"nxt"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One breakage here as compared to with TLA+ is the use of types. TLA+ curiously insists on a lack of intrinsic types and argues against them as a foundational feature. Types are instead propositions that are proved in the system. This just is really not convenient for using with Z3, so from the get-go I’m going to take liberties.</p>

<p>We can implement an <code>always</code> operator via a fairly simple procedure, we just roll out the execution of any formula for <code>n</code> time steps. This is the trick of bounded model checking. This rollout can be achieved by using the Z3 <code>substitute</code> function, a surprisingly useful little fellow.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful with using always. Arbitrarily nesting it’s usage may give unexpected results. Lamport makes an argument that specs very rarely do or should make sophisticated use of the temporal operators. Maybe this is good enough or maybe there is a way to patch this up.</p>

<p>Z3 does in fact return a counter model that fills the buckets up as desired.</p>

<p>TLA+ has a tendency to use functions/records which are not so obvious how to encode. There are different ways of going about this. One aspect of playing around with Z3py is that it makes extremely clear the existence of the logic language and a metalanguage. The logic is Z3 expressions, but the metalanguage is python and they are obviously very different. But there is often a choice of whether to encode things in the logic vs the metalanguage. It is usually better I think to encode as much in python as possible if you can get away with it. Z3 likes piles of simple constraints more than it likes complicated quantifiers and things.</p>

<p>For example, we can want to encode an Enum type in python or in Z3.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>enum</span> <span>import</span> <span>Enum</span><span>,</span> <span>auto</span>

     <span>PREPARED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>COMMITTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>ABORTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>

<span># z3 enum

<span>RMState</span> <span>=</span> <span>RMState</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>()</span>

<p>Downsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very ad hoc. The use of special autogenerated names is a great way to inadvertently smash things together</li>
  <li>TLA syntax is designed to be readable. The python adds a lot of noise</li>
  <li>TLA toolbox can format specs nicely using latex.</li>
  <li>TLA has a lot of thought gone into it. Making changes to it in an afternoon of thought is probably not to be trusted</li>
</ul>

<p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better fits Z3, so we get good automation from the get go</li>
  <li>python is lingua franca of computing. It is comforting compared to TLA+, even if Z3py might be discomfiting.</li>
  <li>Having to download the toolbox and figure out how to use it is always going to be a slight speedbump. There is a TLA+ vscode extension now though. That might help</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Python ast parsing <a href="https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>, we could probably use regular simple python syntax as a PlusCal like DSL and compile it into the above Z3-TLA+ hybrid.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if the CHOOSE operator of TLA+ will be easy to implement. It kind of seems like it requires nested solves? Can it be encoded using</p>

<p>I don’t particularly understand the TLA+ module system yet and I’m not so sure how to emulate it. Python modules might be one way, or perhaps classes.</p>

<p>Although I tried to copy exactly, perhaps one shouldn’t spec in precisely the style of standard TLA+.</p>

<h4>This classic article from Mario Wolczko first
appeared on Usenet in 1986.  </h4>

Have you ever left your terminal logged in, only to find when you
came back to it that a (supposed) friend had typed "<kbd>rm -rf
~/*</kbd>" and was hovering over the keyboard with threats along the
lines of "<em>lend me a fiver 'til Thursday, or I hit return</em>"?
Undoubtedly the person in question would not have had the nerve to
inflict such a trauma upon you, and was doing it in jest.  So you've
probably never experienced the worst of such disasters....<p>


It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday, 1st October, 15:15
BST, to be precise, when Peter, an office-mate of mine, leaned away
from his terminal and said to me, "<em>Mario, I'm having a little
trouble sending mail.</em>" Knowing that msg was capable of confusing
even the most capable of people, I sauntered over to his terminal to
see what was wrong.  A strange error message of the form (I forget
the exact details) "<kbd>cannot access /foo/bar for userid 147</kbd>"
had been issued by msg.  My first thought was "<em>Who's userid 147?;
the sender of the message, the destination, or what?</em>" So I leant
over to another terminal, already logged in, and typed</p><blockquote>        <kbd>grep 147 /etc/passwd</kbd></blockquote>

<p>only to receive the response</p><blockquote>        <kbd>/etc/passwd: No such file or directory.</kbd></blockquote>

Instantly, I guessed that something was amiss.  This was confirmed
when in response to<blockquote>        <kbd>ls /etc</kbd></blockquote>

<p>I got</p><blockquote>        <kbd>ls: not found.</kbd></blockquote>

I suggested to Peter that it would be a good idea not to try anything
for a while, and went off to find our system manager.<p>

When I arrived at his office, his door was ajar, and within ten
seconds I realised what the problem was.  James, our manager, was
sat down, head in hands, hands between knees, as one whose world has
just come to an end.  Our newly-appointed system programmer, Neil, was
beside him, gazing listlessly at the screen of his terminal.  And at
the top of the screen I spied the following lines:</p><blockquote>
        <kbd># cd <br>
        # rm -rf *</kbd>

<p>Oh, shit, I thought.  That would just about explain it.</p><p>


I can't remember what happened in the succeeding minutes; my memory
is just a blur.  I do remember trying <kbd>ls</kbd> (again),
<kbd>ps</kbd>, <kbd>who</kbd> and maybe a few other commands beside,
all to no avail.  The next thing I remember was being at my terminal
again (a multi-window graphics terminal), and typing</p><blockquote>
        <kbd>cd /<br>
        echo *</kbd>
</blockquote>
<p>I owe a debt of thanks to David Korn for making <kbd>echo</kbd> a
built-in of his shell; needless to say, <kbd>/bin</kbd>, together
with <kbd>/bin/echo</kbd>, had been deleted.  What transpired in the
next few minutes was that <kbd>/dev</kbd>, <kbd>/etc</kbd> and
<kbd>/lib</kbd> had also gone in their entirety; fortunately Neil had
interrupted <kbd>rm</kbd> while it was somewhere down below
<kbd>/news</kbd>, and <kbd>/tmp</kbd>, <kbd>/usr</kbd> and
<kbd>/users</kbd> were all untouched.</p><p>


Meanwhile James had made for our tape cupboard and had retrieved what
claimed to be a dump tape of the root filesystem, taken four weeks
earlier.  The pressing question was, "<em>How do we recover the
contents of the tape?</em>".  Not only had we lost
<kbd>/etc/restore</kbd>, but all of the device entries for the tape
deck had vanished.  And where does <kbd>mknod</kbd> live?  You
guessed it, <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  How about recovery across Ethernet of
any of this from another VAX?  Well, <kbd>/bin/tar</kbd> had gone,
and thoughtfully the Berkeley people had put <kbd>rcp</kbd> in
<kbd>/bin</kbd> in the 4.3 distribution.  What's more, none of the
Ether stuff wanted to know without <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> at least.
We found a version of <kbd>cpio</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>, but
that was unlikely to do us any good without a tape deck.</p><p>


Alternatively, we could get the boot tape out and rebuild the root
filesystem, but neither James nor Neil had done that before, and we
weren't sure that the first thing to happen would be that the whole
disk would be re-formatted, losing all our user files.  (We take dumps
of the user files every Thursday; by Murphy's Law this had to happen
on a Wednesday).  Another solution might be to borrow a disk from
another VAX, boot off that, and tidy up later, but that would have
entailed calling the DEC engineer out, at the very least.  We had a
number of users in the final throes of writing up PhD theses and the
loss of a maybe a weeks' work (not to mention the machine down time)
was unthinkable.</p><p>


So, what to do?  The next idea was to write a program to make a
device descriptor for the tape deck, but we all know where
<kbd>cc</kbd>, <kbd>as</kbd> and <kbd>ld</kbd> live.  Or maybe make
skeletal entries for <kbd>/etc/passwd</kbd>, <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd>
and so on, so that <kbd>/usr/bin/ftp</kbd> would work.  By sheer
luck, I had a <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd> still running in one of my windows,
which we could use to create <kbd>passwd</kbd>, etc., but the first
step was to create a directory to put them in.  Of course
<kbd>/bin/mkdir</kbd> had gone, and so had <kbd>/bin/mv</kbd>, so we
couldn't rename <kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  However, this
looked like a reasonable line of attack.</p><p>


By now we had been joined by Alasdair, our resident UNIX guru, and as
luck would have it, someone who knows VAX assembler.  So our plan
became this: write a program in assembler which would either rename
<kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>, or make <kbd>/etc</kbd>, assemble
it on another VAX, <kbd>uuencode</kbd> it, type in the uuencoded file
using my gnu, <kbd>uudecode</kbd> it (some bright spark had thought
to put <kbd>uudecode</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/bin</kbd>), run it, and hey
presto, it would all be plain sailing from there.  By yet another
miracle of good fortune, the terminal from which the damage had been
done was still <kbd>su</kbd>'d to root (<kbd>su</kbd> is in
<kbd>/bin</kbd>, remember?), so at least we stood a chance of all
this working.</p><p>


Off we set on our merry way, and within only an hour we had managed
to concoct the dozen or so lines of assembler to create
<kbd>/etc</kbd>.  The stripped binary was only 76 bytes long, so we
converted it to hex (slightly more readable than the output of
<kbd>uuencode</kbd>), and typed it in using my editor.  If any of you
ever have the same problem, here's the hex for future reference:</p><blockquote>
   <kbd>070100002c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
        0000dd8fff010000dd8f27000000fb02ef07000000fb01ef070000000000bc8f<br>
		8800040000bc012f65746300</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a handy program around (doesn't everybody?) for converting
ASCII hex to binary, and the output of <kbd>/usr/bin/sum</kbd>
tallied with our original binary.  But hang on---how do you set
execute permission without <kbd>/bin/chmod</kbd>?  A few seconds
thought (which as usual, lasted a couple of minutes) suggested that
we write the binary on top of an already existing binary, owned by
me...problem solved.

So along we trotted to the terminal with the root login, carefully
remembered to set the umask to 0 (so that I could create files in it
using my gnu), and ran the binary.  So now we had a <kbd>/etc</kbd>,
writable by all.  From there it was but a few easy steps to creating
<kbd>passwd</kbd>, <kbd>hosts</kbd>, <kbd>services</kbd>,
<kbd>protocols</kbd>, (etc), and then <kbd>ftp</kbd> was willing to
play ball.  Then we recovered the contents of <kbd>/bin</kbd> across
the ether (it's amazing how much you come to miss <kbd>ls</kbd> after
just a few, short hours), and selected files from <kbd>/etc</kbd>.
The key file was <kbd>/etc/rrestore</kbd>, with which we recovered
<kbd>/dev</kbd> from the dump tape, and the rest is history.</p><p>


Now, you're asking yourself (as I am), what's the moral of this
story?  Well, for one thing, you must always remember the immortal
words, <strong>DON'T PANIC</strong>.  Our initial reaction was to
reboot the machine and try everything as single user, but it's
unlikely it would have come up without <kbd>/etc/init</kbd> and
<kbd>/bin/sh</kbd>.  Rational thought saved us from this one.</p><p>


The next thing to remember is that UNIX tools really can be put to
unusual purposes.  Even without my <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd>, we could have
survived by using, say, <kbd>/usr/bin/grep</kbd> as a substitute for
<kbd>/bin/cat</kbd>.</p><p>


And the final thing is, it's amazing how much of the system you can
delete without it falling apart completely.  Apart from the fact that
nobody could login (<kbd>/bin/login</kbd>?), and most of the useful
commands had gone, everything else seemed normal.  Of course, some
things can't stand life without say <kbd>/etc/termcap</kbd>, or
<kbd>/dev/kmem</kbd>, or <kbd>/etc/utmp</kbd>, but by and large it
all hangs together.</p><p>


I shall leave you with this question: if you were placed in the same
situation, and had the presence of mind that always comes with
hindsight, could you have got out of it in a simpler or easier way?

<p><em>Update:</em> See the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25491568">Hacker News thread</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kh6ox0/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/programming</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kh6gh2/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/ProgrammingLanguages</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/kh1p0a/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/gamedev</a> posts for discussions on this article and Cakelisp.</p>
<p>I have been working on a new programming language since the end of August 2020. It is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/makuto/cakelisp/">Github</a>, and mirrored on <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/">my site</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see a working example first, <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame.cake</a> is a simple audio looper with Ogre 3D graphics and SDL for windowing, input, and audio. This demo supports code hot-reloading and doesn't require an external build system, only Cakelisp. You can also check <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/src/branch/master/runtime/Macros.cake">Macros.cake</a>, which demonstrates some use-cases for compile-time code.</p>
<p>I figured showing non-trivial examples would be much more interesting. It also proves that Cakelisp is working.</p>

<p>Cakelisp is built for me first, but it should appeal to fellow programmers who know what they're doing and want to try a more powerful language.</p>
<p>Cakelisp might be for you if you want…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncompromised performance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trust in you, the programmer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Powerful code generation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the things in that list don't make sense to you, or you think you're already getting them in language <em>X</em>, then Cakelisp isn't for you, and that's okay! We have different domains and different problems, so it makes some sense to use different languages and methodologies.</p>
<p>While many languages have these features, few have the combination of all three. Lisp has extremely powerful code generation, but makes serious performance compromises. C is great for performance but can require extremely repetitive code writing to accomplish tasks a simple code generator could handle. Rust is fast (well, apart from compilation, which is very important for iterative development to be productive), but doesn't trust the programmer.</p>

<p>My goal is to "have my cake and eat it too", meaning all three of these features in one coherent package. Importantly, there isn't one dominating principle in Cakelisp (no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ">Big Idea</a>). I've found that the small things like removing the need for header files, no longer dealing with external build systems, or being able to run Cakelisp files like scripts, end up making a big difference when combined in one package.</p>
<p>It is useful to go over the goals in detail so you can understand my decisions.</p>
<h2 id="uncompromised-performance">Uncompromised performance</h2>
<p>This means no garbage collection, no type boxing/unboxing, etc. Fewer abstractions (besides the ones you create) between you and what the computer is actually doing. Idiomatic usage of the language should result in performance comparable with C (in most cases, it should be identical, because it's only a thin layer on C).</p>
<h2 id="trust-in-you-the-programmer">Trust in you, the programmer</h2>
<p>While languages like Rust offer benefits in terms of security and stability, they cost programmers in terms of productivity. It makes sense to value safety so highly if your code is safety-critical (operating systems, aerospace, automotive, etc.), but it's much less valuable when safety isn't as important (e.g. in games).</p>
<p>In a perfect world all programs would be as robust as space flight software, but in reality, that level of robustness is unnecessary for most programs. It's important to realize that the safety focus is just one way of doing things, not the <em>One True Way</em> or anything.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-code-generation">Powerful code generation</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most languages offer far too little opportunity for the programmer to automate the actual writing of code. This power also relates to trusting in the programmer, because gone wild, the code can become incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The company I work for has what I consider to be a state-of-the-art code generator built for the company's use-case: multi-platform MMOs. It's used very effectively on serialization, RPC, automatic commands, monitoring, automatic documentation, and more.</p>
<p>To give more credence to the use of code generation in games, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/index.html">Unreal</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiJqUWfR90I">Naughty Dog</a> also rely on code generation.</p>
<h2 id="simplify-project-setup-and-management">Simplify project setup and management</h2>
<p>I want to dramatically reduce time wasted on C++ project set-up and "code logistics". This includes setting up build systems, creating header files, adding and managing new C/C++ 3rd party libraries, and other things of that ilk.</p>
<h2 id="gain-more-power">Gain more power!</h2>
<p>Every language has limitations. The lack of straightforward, all-powerful code generation was my primary gripe with C++.</p>
<p>For example, automatically creating function and structure bindings using C++ template metaprogramming is very complex. These are two very useful tools in game development: function bindings for commands, scripting languages, and RPC; structure bindings for serialization or game monitors.</p>
<p>I also wanted features like hot-reloading (being able to load new versions of the code without restarting the program/losing runtime state). Cakelisp made it possible to implement hot-reloading entirely in "user-space", thanks to code modification.</p>
<h2 id="have-my-cake-and-eat-it-too.">"Have my cake and eat it too."</h2>
<p>By this I mean lose little-to-nothing on metrics I care about, which include build time, runtime performance, overall complexity, and various other things. I looked into several languages in my <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">LanguageTests</a> experiment and found they all had major drawbacks I couldn't accept.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-freedom">Unexpected freedom</h2>
<p>I did not realize when I started Cakelisp how freeing it felt. All of the sudden, I got to decide what made sense to <em>me</em>, not what made sense to previous language designers.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-syntax">Freedom in syntax</h3>
<p>A simple example is type declarations. In C:</p>

<p>The same variable, in Cakelisp:</p>

<p>In my opinion C type declarations are much harder to parse than my explicit type declarations. You need to work backwards from the name to properly interpret the type. The parentheses do add more typing, but they're more clear, machine-parseable, and can be read naturally (e.g. read left to right "pointer to constant character" vs. C's "constant character pointer", which seems worse in my mind).</p>
<p>My form also handles arrays as part of the type: <code>(var my-array ([] 5 int))</code> rather than <code>int myArray[5];</code>, another way it is more consistent, readable, and parsable.</p>
<p>I chose to swap the order of name and type because it places more emphasis on the name. A well-written program will convey more useful information in the name than in the type, so it makes sense to me to have it come first for the reader.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-process">Freedom in process</h3>
<p>I also found that having an executable which preprocesses my code exactly how I want it opens the door to a huge amount of awesome features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time code execution. "Macros" and "Generators" are defined in-line with the rest of your code, making them feel like a natural part of your code. Defining them in-line makes it acceptable to add one-off macros, whereas adding such a thing to an external code generator would quickly become unmaintainable</li>
<li>Build optimization. A recent idea I discovered is automatically creating precompiled headers for large batches of 3rd-party headers. This would be a complex task that would need to be integrated in whatever build system you use, whereas Cakelisp can have it built-in</li>
<li>Other data processing. Compile-time code execution means you can do things like prepare assets, download 3rd-party code, run tests, etc. without having to set up all these additional tools</li>
</ul>

<p>I was inspired by Naughty Dog's use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp">Game Oriented Assembly Lisp</a>, GOOL, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c">Racket/Scheme</a> (on their modern titles). I've also taken several ideas from Jonathan Blow's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888">talks on Jai</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer in the game industry. I've been working since July 2015 at a studio that makes cross-platform MMOs. The company has a custom engine written in C (with some C++).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">experimented</a> with other languages before deciding I needed to write my own.</p>

<p>Now that my goals are clear, I will show you how I approached achieving them.</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>Cakelisp uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>-style notation. Here is some Cakelisp code from <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame</a>:</p>

<p>There are a few things you can notice from reading this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types. Cakelisp is strongly- and explicitly-typed. I prefer reading code with explicit types because I can better imagine what the computer is actually doing, and what possibilities I have with each variable</li>
<li>Name-type order. I talked about this in a previous section. I wanted to emphasize the name of a variable for conveying meaning, especially when you may have many variables of the same type</li>
<li>Explicit <code>return</code>. I find I prefer code where return points are made explicit. Lisp will implicitly return the result of the last evaluation</li>
<li>Lisp-y style. The parentheses, plus keywords like <code>unless</code>, <code>defun</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>at</code>, and <code>incr</code>. I matched Lisp only when I didn't have strong opinions for a better notation. I am not trying to create something which is compatible with existing Lisps</li>
<li>C types and function calls. Cakelisp has seamless C interop, which means Cakelisp's "standard library" <em>is</em> C's standard library. No bindings had to be written to use the C types or make the function calls</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more Cakelisp code in <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/src">Gamelib</a>.</p>
<p>You should think of Cakelisp more as "C in S-expressions" rather than "Lisp with C performance". If you know C, you'll have a relatively smooth transition to Cakelisp. If you only know Lisp, you're going to have a rougher time.</p>
<h3 id="why-s-expressions">Why S-expressions?</h3>
<p>When I set out to make Cakelisp, I decided on S-expressions syntax for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsability. S-expressions shift the burden of creating a syntax tree onto the programmer. This does result on more work for the human, but I value its extremely explicit nature. It also facilitates simpler tokenization, domain-specific-language implementation, and external tool support</li>
<li>Consistency. There are only four types of tokens in Cakelisp: open and close parenthesis, symbol, and string. The consistency is admittedly limiting, so things like paths (<code>myThing-&gt;member.member</code>) become much more verbose to type, unfortunately. However, this limitation keeps Cakelisp code parsable, and has an elegant feel that I appreciate</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe there is one notation to rule them all, especially after I've encountered the disadvantages of using S-exprs. I'm still happy with the decision though, and it does give Cakelisp a novel and distinguishing characteristic from the many …</p></article></div>

For a local installation, supply instead of "pil" the actual path like "./pil"
or "../pil21/pil".

The pieces are indicated by the letters 'K'ing, 'Q'ueen, 'R'ook, 'B'ishop,
k'N'ight and 'P'awn, with black pieces in angular brackets.

You can enter your moves with the field names (in lower case) for the "from" and
"to" positions:

: (go e2 e4)

Castling may be entered by just specifying the king's move:

: (go e1 g1)

To promote a pawn to some piece other than a queen, you can specify a class:

: (go h7 h8 +Knight)

To undo one or several moves, enter

: (go -)

and to redo them

: (go +)

To switch sides (and have the computer play against itself), call 'go' without
arguments:

: (go)

The initial board position can be restored with

: (main)

The global variable '*Depth' holds the maximal depth of the alpha-beta tree
search. It defaults to 5. You may change it to some smaller value for a faster
response, or to a larger value for a deeper search:

: (setq *Depth 7)

The same effect can be achieved by passing the desired depth as the first
argument to 'main':

: (main 7)

The second (optional) argument to 'main' is your color ('NIL' for white and 'T'
for black).

To setup some given board position, call 'main' with a list of triples, with
each describing:

   1. The field
   2. The piece's classes
   3. An optional flag to indicate that the piece did not move yet

: (main 5 NIL

At any time, you can print the current board position in the above format to a
file with

: (ppos "file")

which later can be restored with

: (load "file")


   === PilBox and Web App ===

If you have the PilBox App installed on your Android device, just type "chess"
in the settings and press the "Download" button.

To start the Web application, use

   $ pil chess/main.l -chess~main -go +

Alternatively, you can start it with German localization as

   $ pil chess/main.l -'chess~main "DE" "de"' -go +

then point your browser to http://localhost:8080

In both cases you can interact with the chess board in this way:

   â€” To enter a move, drag a piece to the new field.
   â€” A click on the board does an auto-move and then switches sides.
   â€” The search depth can be changed with a drop-down menu.
   â€” The "New" button starts a new game, and the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons
     navigate in the history.
   â€” The text "White" or "Black" indicate who is to move next. It changes to
     "White ..." or "Black ..." while the computer is thinking.
   â€” After a move, the moved piece and the old and new positions are indicated
     above that text.

The "Setup" button switches to edit mode and allows you to change the position
manually:

   â€” A click on a piece removes it from the board.
   â€” Dragging a piece moves it to another field.
   â€” A new piece can be placed on the board by dragging it from the setup area.
   â€” The "Clear" button removes all pieces from the board.
   â€” The "New" button sets up all pieces for a new game.
   â€” The "Game" button switches back to play mode.

As in any PilBox app, you can go to the settings (wheel icon on top right) and

   â€” switch to another language in the "Language" tab or
   â€” view the App's source code by clicking on the app name "chess" in the
     "PILs" tab.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE
</code></pre><p>The script has successfully loaded the program and now we wait for the traces to arrive. The next thing to do is to try and invoke the <code>clone</code> syscall. We can run any command on the terminal, such as <code>ls</code> and a child process will be created. Since I had firefox running, it created some child processes in the meantime and traces started to show up:</p><pre><code>611.247475000      firefox          5378   Hello, World!
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the message “Hello, World!” is printed on the screen along with the other trace fields. Super cool!</p><p>Besides attaching to kernel functions, we could also observe functions invoked in user space, such as <strong>malloc</strong> or <strong>strlen</strong>. This is possible via another Linux kernel feature - <strong>uprobes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an interesting script that counts frequencies of strings by tracing strlen() and using a hash map to store the strings along with the count of their recurrence: <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py</a></p><h2 id="helper-functions">helper functions</h2><p>Since arbitrary kernel functions are prohibited to be called by ebpf programs, there are several helper functions which the kernel provides for us, such as the <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> function. We can use them to:</p><ul><li>Get the current time</li><li>Interact with eBPF maps</li><li>Manipulate network packets</li><li>Print debugging messages</li></ul><p>Note that each program can only use a subset of these helpers because of the different contexts the programs can run in. Here’s the extensive <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">list</a> of bpf helpers.</p><h2 id="map-storage">map storage</h2><p>To write more complicated programs you’ll need some type of data store, and that is where <strong>maps</strong> come in. They are an important part of the BPF internal system, which allows programs to store information that can be accessed from userspace.</p><p>BPF supports different <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps">types</a> of data stores - you can use a hash map, an array, or even a stack or a queue, depending on the use case of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p>eBPF opens up all kinds of possibilities for observability. You can treat a system as a blackbox, without really knowing anything about it, and run all kinds of interesting analysis: count the most frequently called functions, trace network packets, do performance tracing and debugging, etc.</p><p>There are a myriad of tools that you can use to observe every component of the system: the CPU, memory, file system, networking, containers, applications…</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b19abde4b1ccfe4ce140969c8bf44f39d1c2fe70/f9ed3/images/ebpf/bcc_tracing_tools_early2019.png" alt="ebpf-tracing-tools"><figcaption>BCC performance tools (courtesy of Brendan Gregg)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve only scratched the surface on this subject and I can’t wait to learn more about it, as well as Linux performance in general.

						<p>According to <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uarl-asf121720.php">an announcement in EurekAlert</a>!, The U.S. Army has been researching with Duke University a technological approach that uses robotics and "biohybrid" muscle elements.</p><p>Army researchers claim that robotic systems filled with muscle tissue will deliver a new level of agility and flexibility. In order to maximize efficiency, biohybrid robotics incorporates living organisms into mechanical systems. The team's first applications are legged platforms similar to the LLAMA and Marine Corps Legged Squad Support System (LS3), the legged locomotive and movement adaptation device of the Army.</p><p>"Though impressive in their own right, today's robots are deployed to serve a limited purpose then are retrieved some minutes later," said research scientist Dr. Dean Culver, "ARL wants robots to be versatile teammates capable of going anywhere soldiers can and more, adapting to the needs of any given situation." Culver added, "Organisms outperform engineered robots in so many ways. Why not use biological components to achieve those remarkable capabilities?"</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Humanoid robot Robotis Bioloid with the hands in the air, cheering." srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anilinverse?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Adam Lukomski</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>In addition, a separate team from Duke University will focus on the characteristics of macroscopic performance of muscles, tendons and ligaments in skiping animals using legged robots.</p><p>The muscle tissue is excellent for generating a certain mechanical strength, and its flexibility is unrivaled in today's robotic service. The research could show the bio-hybrid engineering community how to grow strong muscular tissue instead of extracting it from a trained organism in addition to providing insight into the mesomechanics that control motor protein movement.</p><p>"Muscle tissue is outstanding at producing a specific amount of mechanical power at a given moment," says Culver, "and its versatility is unrivaled in robotic actuation today."</p>

All I know is this: Where the topic of GNOME’s health goes, accurate data rarely follows. Of course, there <em>is</em> data — lots of it in fact, in public source code repositories. Though flawed in many ways, it allows us to make comparisons to the past — and maybe predictions for the future: Are a few organizations carrying most of the workload, making them critical points of failure? Are new contributors able to pick up the slack from those who leave? Is the project graying (i.e. increasingly dominated by veterans)?</p><p>In one of my occasional fits of hubris, I set out to process this data to see if I could shake out anything meaningful. I’m usually fine with just satisfying my own curiosity and leaving it at that, but it’s one of those times where the results seem interesting enough for a blog post. So here we are.</p><p>I’m going to lead with the nice graphs and follow on with a <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#methodology">section on methodology</a>.

Each contributor is assigned to a generational cohort based on the year of their first contribution. The cohorts tend to shrink over time as people leave.</p><p>There’s a special “drive-by” cohort (in a fetching shade of off-white) for contributors who were only briefly involved, meaning all their activity fits in a three-month window. It’s a big group. In a typical year, it numbers 200-400 persons who were not seen before or since. Most of them contribute a single commit.</p><p>According to this, GNOME peaked at slightly above 1,400 contributors in 2010 and went into decline with the GNOME 3.0 release the following year. However, 2020 saw the most contributors in a long time, even with preliminary data — there’s still two weeks to go. Who knows if it’s an anomaly or not. It’s been an atypical year across the board.</p><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per month, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>This is the same histogram, but with per-month bins.

It’s safe to say that GNOME is dependent on paid developers in a big way. Specifically, and to no one’s surprise, it leans heavily on Red Hat.</p><h2 id="observations">General observations</h2><p>A few observations can be made with confidence:</p><ul><li>By F/OSS standards, the project is not <em>un</em>healthy. It has hundreds of experienced and first-time contributors every year. It is well-organized and arguably well-funded compared to its peers. But:</li><li>Every metric has the project peaking around 2010.</li><li>A diminishing number of veterans is doing an increasing share of the work.</li><li>Although recruitment is stable, newcomers don’t seem to be hitting their stride in terms of commits.</li><li>Corporate sponsorship is probably necessary to keep the project going, but the field of sponsors has kept thinning.</li></ul><p>I think GNOME is addressing the risk factors competently by modernizing infrastructure (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/">Discourse</a>). This has obvious value even in the absence of quantifiable results, but it’ll be interesting to see if the effect can be measured over the next couple of years.</p><p>Diminished enthusiasm may also be due to there being fewer ways for a new contributor to make their mark or assume a role of responsibility. GNOME has become more conservative, certainly much more so than it was a decade ago in the run-up to GNOME 3. The rationale and phrasing in <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/new-gnome-versioning-scheme/4235">the announcement of the new versioning scheme</a> (e.g. <em>“Radical technological and design changes are too disruptive for maintainers, users, and developers”</em>) seems indicative of this trend<sup>1</sup>.</p><h2 id="methodology">Notes on methodology</h2><p>So what’s wrong with this analysis? If you’re so inclined, you can find the details under the next couple of subheadings and pass harsh, harsh judgement.</p><p>I’ve set the unscientific rigor bar high enough to hopefully yield something useful, but low enough that I could do it in my spare time and not get stuck in the dreaded state commonly known as “90% done”.</p><h3>Module selection</h3><p>I aggregated data from <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-repos">189 Git repositories</a>. The vast majority of these are hosted on <code>gnome.org</code>, with a handful from <code>freedesktop.org</code> and <code>github.com</code>. Commits are uniquely identified by their commit hash, meaning trivial duplicates are counted only once.</p><p>GNOME has always been a decentralized, big-tent project, so it’s not obvious how to delineate it. I’ve tried to be fair by including most of the repositories from a full meta-gnome-desktop jhbuild, including fairly low-level dependencies like Cairo, Pango, and Pipewire, as well as past, present and would-be flagship applications under the GNOME umbrella. Documentation and infrastructure is represented, as are many archived projects (e.g. ORBit2, Bonobo, Sabayon, GAL).</p><p>I was a little uncertain about what to do with X.Org and Wayland. In the end I decided to include the latter, but not the former, since Wayland has close ties to GNOME (it even references GTK+ in its TODO file), while X.Org has its roots in the much older XFree86.</p><p>Mono is another project I resisted including; its development was tangential to GNOME proper, diverging completely in the most recent decade. However, I did include GtkSharp and several GNOME-hosted C# applications common on desktops in the 2005-2010 time frame.</p><p>Since I haven’t established hard criteria for module selection, it’s subject to various biases. Older code is probably underrepresented, since providers of important functionality were more loosely attached to the project early on (e.g. GNOME Online Accounts and Telepathy got pulled in, should I have included Gaim or Pidgin too? How about XChat?).</p><p>Anyway, the list isn’t terrible, but there’s room for improvement.</p><h3>Contributor identities</h3><p>Similar studies often identify contributors by their e-mail addresses. I used full author names instead, since there’s good reason to think they’re more stable over a 20-year time span. We’re fairly consistent in spelling our own names, and we change them rarely (often never). On the other hand, e-mail addresses come and go with different hosting arrangements, employers, etc.</p><p>An added challenge with this approach is that sometimes different people have the exact same name. In practice, I’m not aware of any instances of this happening in GNOME. It seems to be rare enough that I doubt it’d introduce significant error in most projects.</p><p>I should add here that the drive-by cohort depends on a fair amount of hindsight (you never know when someone might come back with more contributions, but the likelihood drops off quickly as time passes). This means the cohorts for 2020 are preliminary. They’ll be a lot more accurate with another run late next year.</p><h3>Domain names</h3><p>I’m using e-mail domain names as a proxy for organizations in some of the graphs. This is a notoriously unreliable approach for at least three reasons:</p><ol><li>Contributors often use personal e-mail addresses for paid work, leading to significant undercounting in general.</li><li>Specific companies may require their employees (or ask them nicely) to use company e-mail for collaboration. Out of the listed companies, I know of at least one that definitely did this. However, there are many that don’t, and these will be comparatively less well represented.</li><li>The mapping between DNS and organizations isn’t one-to-one. A company may operate under multiple names or TLDs (e.g. <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.com</code>).</li></ol><p>Despite these weaknesses, it’s common to slice the data this way. It’s difficult to do better without access to semi-closed data troves, and depending on your views on privacy and ability to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a> safely, it might not be something you’d want to get into anyway. But I bet you’d be well-positioned for it if you were, say, the corporate owner of both LinkedIn and GitHub.</p><p>When grouping by organization, the goal is to get an idea of which outside entities are sponsoring contributions. Therefore, I’ve filtered out addresses from the biggest mass e-mail providers like <code>@gmail.com</code> and project-centric providers of personal accounts (e.g. <code>@gnome.org</code>, <code>@gtk.org</code>).</p><p>I took the liberty of reassigning the personal domains of a few extra prolific authors who would’ve otherwise showed up as individual organizations. Since there’s no way I’m doing it for everyone, this introduces some bias. The full details are in <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-meta.json">the project’s metadata file</a> (see: <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#code">code</a>).</p><h3>Version control systems</h3><p>Changeovers in version control systems divide GNOME’s VCS history into three eras with noticeable discontinuities between them.</p><h4>Before 1998: Dark ages</h4><p>In the Bad Old Days, Free Software would often use plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">RCS</a> or no version control at all.

        <p>I recently had the opportunity to encrypt/decrypt stuff using AES, but I didn’t know it inside out well. I couldn’t help but be curious about how it is working, and I realized my mind could only be satisfied by digging deeper into its implementation.
This post walks you through how AES encryption works by reading core implementation written in Go.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-aes-encryption">What is AES encryption?</h2>
<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher, an alternative to the DES. Cryptographers from around the world proposed algorithms, from which the Rijndael algorithm was selected in 2000. Hence we’ll take a look the implementation of this Rijndael.</p>
<h2 id="rijndael">Rijndael</h2>
<p>Rijndael is a block cipher algorithm. A block cipher is a cryptographic algorithm that processes a specific number of bits at a time.
The number of bits (called block length) to be processed at a time depends on the algorithm, AES is 128-bits (16-bytes). Most plaintext we encrypt is longer than this block length, so we typically use this block cipher algorithm repeatedly.
Keep in mind this post goes into some details on only on one block’s process to focus more on the core algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="digging-deeper-into-the-implementation">Digging deeper into the implementation</h2>
<p>The Go language officially provides the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes/">crypto/aes</a> package, which makes use of Go Assembly to leverage Intel’s hardware support for AES if it’s built for amd64.
It otherwise uses the implementation written in pure Go. Let’s take a look at the pure Go implementation that the human mind relatively can work in.</p>
<p>The public method <code>aesCipher.Encrypt</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/55b58018f41e6de63bdaa8f3d9a284077d4e88c1/src/crypto/aes/cipher.go#L54-L65">aes/cipher.go</a> looks to implement a block cipher:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Rijndael encrypts a block by repeating a process called a round.
In a round, there are four processes: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. As commented out in the snippet, the number of rounds depends on the key length.</p>
<h3 id="subbytes">SubBytes</h3>
<p>The conversion is done 1-byte at a time based on a conversion table called S-box which has 256 values.
Below illustrates to perform <code>sbox[s0[1]]</code> well:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-sbox.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<p>Unlike DES, we can see that all bytes have been converted at this point.
This post doesn’t cover AES’s S-Box as it is mentioned in many places and much better than I could do.</p>
<h3 id="shiftrows">ShiftRows</h3>
<p>The next step is to process the rows that are grouped into 4-byte units and shifted regularly to the left.
The number of bytes to be shifted depends on the line, as shown below:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-shift-rows.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<h3 id="mixcolumns">MixColumns</h3>
<p>In the previous step, it dealt with rows, but the next is to process the bytes in columns.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-mix-columns.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<p>It involves multiplication operations in a finite field, hence this step is a bit tough to describe. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_MixColumns">Wikipedia</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="addroundkey">AddRoundKey</h3>
<p>Finally, it XORs the output of MixColumns with the round key. The following figure shows the execution of <code>s0[1] ^ xk[4]</code> (the <code>^</code> denotes an XOR operation in Go).</p>

<p>While this post has only shown you the encryption process, these processes are fully reversible with an Inverse MixColumns, ShiftRows, SubBytes. How beautiful!
I’ll keep reading the implementation to deepen my understanding of cryptography.</p>

            <h2>2009 - Communication</h2>
            <p>
              Far back in 2009, while following Digital Communication, Advertising and Art Direction at NABA (New Academy of Fine Arts of Milan), I became interested in Professor Massimo Banzi's classes and managed to get an Arduino Diecimila. In just one day my vision of the world had changed and I slowly started to better understand computers and electronics while sharing results with the Arduino community both on my website and on Arduino's forum. I started to build robots and after few years of experiments I launched my first start­up: a webshop of arduino-compatible, CNC machined robot kits, boards and sensors.

            <h2>2010 - Let's transmit data</h2>
            <p>
              At the time in my projects I had to connect many microcontrollers on a common bus and I found myself not satisfied by the solutions available, for this reason I started to develop my own data link. I perfectly remember that night back in 2010 when I started bit-banging bits using an Arduino and trying to sample them with another. The first problem I hit were bugs in the implementation that were quickly resolved. Then I unsterstood I did not have any synchronization, depending on when the receiver was powered on bits were shifted. That night, with no experience in electronics or engineering I instinctively defined the synchronization pulse that is still present as the core of <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/13.0/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJDL (Padded Jittering Data Link) v5.0</a>. To make sure to synchronize with the start of each byte I have added a 1 longer than data bits followed by a 0 and instructed the receiver to find it and only then start sampling 8 bits. Data was coming in perfectly. That was <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/obsolete/padded-jittering-protocol-specification-v0.1.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJDL (Padded jittering data link) v0.1</a> which was basic and working by mere chance. Then, after debugging it further, experiments proved it was working well not only through wires and the human body, but also wirelessly through radio and infrared light, yet it showed to be robust operating bidirectionally in spite of interference. After I noticed that it was possible to connect more than 2 devices to the same wire, I started to experiment with an initial collision avoidance phase, an 8 bits device id and a synchronous acknowledgement at the end of the packet. It was shocking to see that many devices were able to send and receive data through the same wire. Soon after I released <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.1.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.1</a> on the Arduino forum, receiving plenty of "don't ­reinvent ­the ­wheel" and few active contributors.

            <h2>2014 - Let's network</h2>
            <p>
              In those days I became aware of how quickly the cloud was eating the world and how difficult was to connect stuff directly without relying on a third-party. It seemed like noone could connect computers together anymore without an ever present observing big brother. To be honest, I did not like it: that was the point when I understood how <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON</a> could have changed the game and what I personally could have done to influence the outcome. I decided to double my efforts on the protocol and try my best to provide humanity with a free and more efficient way to make networks. With a working protocol layer and support from the community, I went further in the address space development adding an optional 32 bits bus id used to identify a group of up to 255 devices, supporting up to 4.294.967.295 buses and a total of 1.090.921.692.930 devices. This addition released in <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.2.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.2</a> enabled coexistence and networking for groups of devices. Thanks to Micheal Teeuw's post on his blog, PJON received contributions, testing, debugging and feature requests. Then many talented contributors added support for devices like ESP8266, Teensy 3.2 and Node MCU.

            <h2>2015 - Abstracting the data link</h2>
            <p>
              The community wanted to use PJON over different existing protocols and physical layers, to obtain that without making the implementation complex and more difficult to use I have defined the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy</a> abstraction. The curiously recurring template pattern or CRTP was adopted to abstract the physical layer in separate classes called strategies. Thanks to this change from then it was possible to instantiate a PJON object passing the selected data link. Initially, I developed three strategies, a bit-banged implementation of <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/13.0/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md">PJDL</a> called <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang">SoftwareBitBang</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/OverSampling">OverSampling</a> for radio communication and <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/AnalogSampling">AnalogSampling</a> able to communicate wirelessly or with optical fiber using off-the-shelf LEDs. Later on, I developed together with Fred Larsen <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/ThroughSerial">ThroughSerial</a> able to operate through a serial port.

The initial response, especially in the Hackaday's comments, was quite negative - trolls were raging. Only when I joined the discussion and answered openly and sincerely to all the complaints and questions asked, the tone changed dramatically. Well, so dramatically, that in the next comments I got the most praiseworthy compliments I have ever received, those people for sure helped me not to desist. Since then, the PJON protocol specification has been used in academic researches and PhDs in different parts of the world, and the official PJON implementation has already been applied globally in a wide range of different systems.

            <h2>2016 - Let's add a header</h2>
            <p>
              The release of the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.3.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.3</a> was the result of the most interesting proposal I have received so far, by Fred Larsen, who is a great friend already even if we never met personally. He proposed the addition of a 8 bits header containing a map of the fields contained in the packet and the configuration requested by the sender. At this point we left a fixed configuration scenario, where interoperability was impossible, heading towards a dynamic network architecture. An entire new set of possibilities opened up and users started to make use of this new field.

It became possible to create a PJON network of devices using also an Internet connection. Our constantly growing community has already provided PJON implementations in other programming languages like <a href="https://github.com/Girgitt/PJON-python">PJON-python</a> by Zbigniew Zasieczny and <a href="https://github.com/Matheus-Garbelini/PJON-C">PJON-c</a> by Matheus Garbelini. Thanks to their work, it was for the first time possible to run PJON on a wider range of devices. At the same time the protocol reached its first stable version with the release of the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v1.0.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v1.0</a> which added a lot of new features.

            <h2>2017 - Let's make it universal</h2>
            <p>
              New features brought new objectives: the community wanted to have <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON">PJON</a> working on many different MCUs and real time operative systems although I wanted to avoid code duplication and maintain only one unified implementation. For this reason I defined the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces">interface</a> abstraction. With interfaces it was for the first time possible to run and cross-compile the same implementation on all supported targets. I developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/RPI">RPI</a> interface to support Raspberry Pi, after few weeks Zbigniew Zasieczny developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/WINX86">WINX86</a> interface enabling PJON communication on Windows computers, and soon after, Fred Larsen developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/LINUX">LINUX</a> interface. In late 2017 I discovered that frame inizialization was missing from both the specification and the implementation and that arbitrary data could have been mistaken for a valid frame. I vividly remember how shocked I was, that was a serious hole, so I quickly found a way to safely identify frames in each strategy. After that was fixed and all seemed perfect I discovered the <a href="https://betterembsw.blogspot.com/2012/02/can-protocol-vulnerabilities.html">length corruption vulnerability</a> that affected PJON and still affects CAN (Controlled Area Network). To close that hole I added an additional CRC8 to protect the header and soon after I released <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/9.0/specification/PJON-protocol-specification-v2.0.md">PJON v2.0</a>.

            <h2>2018 - Distributed field test</h2>
            <p>
              Although PJON is licensed "AS IS", the more it was applied in the real world, the more I was feeling the responsibility for possible failures. When in 2018 Fred Larsen used PJON and <a href="https://github.com/fredilarsen/ModuleInterface">ModuleInterface</a> to handle the life support systems of his hens' house in Norway I started to be preoccupied for those animals and be finally aware of the potential consequencies and the risks involved in PJON real world applications, specially if dealing with living beings. If for whatever reason the temperature value transmitted was corrupted by interference or because of a bug, the hens could have ended up frozen or roasted. The conception of this possibility pushed me to study deeper the implementation and make better software.

<p>Hey guys, today I am going to talk about some features of the <code>print()</code> function in python. You will probably have come across some of these functions while others could seem new.</p>
<p>Let's start by understanding the basics of the print function. 
In python, the built-in print function is used to print all kinds of stuff - text, numbers, objects, dictionaries etc.
But how does this function handle that ?! You might think; it just can do it, it was made for that. But in reality, the print function in python can only handle strings.</p>
<p>Under the hood, anything you pass to the <code>print()</code> function gets converted to a string before being printed to your screen. That mean it will make use of the <code>str()</code> type casting and convert all other data types to strings before displaying them to your console/terminal.
Now that you know how the <code>print()</code> work, let's dive into its features.</p>
<p>Furthermore, print doesn't know how to print text to the screen. I won't go detail into that for now. Later in this post, you will know what happens under it.</p>
<p>Basically, you can print whatever you want . The simplest example you have come across is <code>print("Hello World!")</code>
It take a string enclosed in double quotes or single quotes and prints it.
You can also print multiple stuff by simply separating them with comas as such :</p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Mike"</span>
age = <span>24</span>
print(<span>"Hello"</span>, name, <span>"Your age is"</span>, age)

</code></pre>
<p>You can as well print text that takes more than a line. In this case, you will be using the newline escape character <code>\n</code>
Example :</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>"Hello \nWorld"</span>)



</code></pre>
<p>You can also format text with it. Making use of <code>f-strings</code></p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Samson"</span>
print(<span>f"Hello <span>{name}</span>"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>The example above showcase the basics of the print function. It can take a variable number of values to print. Other than that, there are also some keyword arguments.
Let's dive into them</p>
<h2 id="1-separator">1. Separator</h2>
<p><code>print()</code> allows you to decide what separates text we print with it. By default, all the values you pass to it are separated by empty strings. But we change that. It suffices to include <code>sep=</code> followed by whatever you want to separate your text.
Let's make use of the previous example.</p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Mike"</span>
age = <span>24</span>
print(<span>"Hello"</span>, name, <span>"Your age is"</span>, age, sep=<span>"-"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>You notice that all what we passed into it separately are separated by a <code>-</code>. You can modify that however you want. You just need to make sure the separator is a valid string.</p>
<h2 id="2-ending">2. Ending</h2>
<p>You can specify by whatever you want your output to end with. By default, what you print end with a newline escape character <code>\n</code>. Let's change that and see what happens</p>
<pre><code>
print(<span>"Hello James"</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>)





print(<span>"Hello James"</span>, end=<span>""</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>, end=<span>""</span>)


</code></pre>
<p>If we execute that, we notice the text is no more separated by a new line. Let's try that again! But this time, we want it to end by <code>y</code> and move to a new line.</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>"Hello James"</span>, end=<span>"y\n"</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>, end=<span>"\n"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>We get the following output</p>
<pre><code><span>Hello</span> Jamesy
How are you doingy
</code></pre><p>Yay it worked !</p>
<h2 id="3-writing-to-a-file">3. Writing to a file</h2>
<p>At the beginning of this post, I said python doesn't know how to print stuff to the screen by itself. It rather uses <code>sys.stdout</code> and writes your text to that file. 
Wait what ! Print will write text to a file object which I sent to your screen via <code>sys.stdout</code>. Therefore, you can modify this behaviour too in order to have this printed elsewhere.
Let's give it a try.
Write the following code:</p>
<pre><code><span>with</span> open(<span>"hello.txt"</span>, <span>"w"</span>) <span>as</span> file_object:
        print(<span>"This message is for you"</span>, file=file_object)
</code></pre>
<p>Executing the above will end in a file name <code>hello.text</code> in the same directory with the text <em>This message is for you</em> in it. 
Therefore, we can direct where we want our text to be printed. In this case, we created a file name <code>hello.txt</code> and use the <code>file</code> keyword argument to direct the result to be written to that file rather than our terminal. You can use this to direct any result to wherever you want, even through a socket connection.</p>
<h2 id="4-flushing">4. Flushing</h2>
<p>This one requires an example. Let's have one!</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> time

names = [<span>"John"</span>, <span>"Sylvia"</span>, <span>"Smith"</span>]

<span>for</span> name <span>in</span> names:
    print(name, end=<span>" "</span>)
    time.sleep(<span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>What this code should do is; print a name after a second. Try and run it and see what happens. 
You notice it unexpectedly waits and print all at once.  This is because since it's on a single line, it is all buffered (packed) before we get it. 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20data,from%20one%20place%20to%20another.&amp;text=However%2C%20a%20buffer%20may%20be,comparable%20to%20buffers%20in%20telecommunication.">Read more about buffers here</a>
But we could go around that by simply adding the <code>flush=</code> keyword argument to the print function. By default it it set to <code>False</code>. Setting it to true will ensure every print statement is executed and freed from buffer before the next one.
The following code will make it :</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> time

names = [<span>"John"</span>, <span>"Sylvia"</span>, <span>"Smith"</span>]

<span>for</span> name <span>in</span> names:
    print(name, end=<span>", "</span>, flush=<span>True</span>)
    time.sleep(<span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>If you run it. It will print a name, sleep for a second and print another, all on the same line. 
Yay we did it !</p>
<p>You have reached the end of this post.

            <p>
            In this post we will tackle Artificial Intelligence with baby steps and try to build a very simple neural net in Java.
            </p>

            <h5 id="what-is-a-neural-net">What is a Neural net?</h5>

            <p>
            A neural net is a software representation of how the brain works. Unfortunately, we do not know as of yet how exactly does the brain really work but we do know a little bit of the biology behind this process: the human brain consists of 100 billion cells called neurons, connected together by synapses. If sufficient synapses connected to a neuron fire, then that neuron will also fire. This process is known as "thinking".
            </p>

            <p>
            We thus try and model the above process using a very simple example that has 3 inputs (synapses) and results in a single output (1 neuron firing).

            <img alt="Neural net example" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-simple-problem.png" width="400">
            </p>



            <h5 id="a-simple-problem">A simple problem</h5>

            <p>
            We will train our above neural net to solve the following problem. Can you figure out the pattern and guess what the value of the new input should be? 0 or 1?
            </p>

            <div>
              <table>
              <tbody><tr>
                <th>Examples</th>
                <th colspan="3">Input</th>
                <th>Output</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Example 1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 2</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 3</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 4</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td colspan="5">&nbsp;</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>New situation</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>?</td>
              </tr>

              </tbody></table>
            </div>

            <p>
            The answer is actually very simply the value of the left-most column, i.e. 1!
            </p>


            <h5 id="training-process">The training process</h5>

            <p>
            So now that we have the model of a human brain, we will try and get our neural net to learn what the pattern is given the training set. We will first assign each input a random number to produce an output.
            </p>

            <p><img alt="Neural net example" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-simple-problem-neuron-weights.png" width="400"></p><p>
            The formula for calculating the output is given as follows:
            $$\sum weight_i . input_i = weight1 . input1 + weight2 . input2 + weight3 . input3$$
            </p>

            <p>
            As it turns out we would like to normalize this output value to something between 0 and 1 so that the prediction makes sense. After normalization we compare the output with the expected output of our inputs. This gives us the error, or how far off is our prediction. We can then use this error to slightly adjust the weights of our neural net and try our luck on the same input again. This can be summarized in the following image:
            </p>

            <!--
            <div>
                <a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png">
                    <img class="img-responsive centered img-border" alt="Neural net training process" src="/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png" />
                </a>
                <div class="img-desc">
                </div>
            </div>
            -->

            <p><img alt="Neural net training process" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png" width="450"></p><p>
            We repeat this training process for all the inputs <i><b>10,000 times</b></i> to reach a satisfactorily trained neural net. We can then use this neural net to make predictions on new inputs!
            </p>

            <p>
            Before we jump into the implementation however, we still need to clarify how we achieved the normalization and the weight adjustment based on the error (also known as back-propagation).
            </p>

            <h5 id="normalization">Normalization</h5>

            <p>
            In a biologically inspired neural network, the output of a neuron is usually an abstraction representing the rate of action potential firing in the cell. In its simplest form, this is binary value, i.e., either the neuron is firing or not. Hence, the need for normalization of this output value.
            </p>

            <p>
            To achieve this normalization we apply what is known as an activation function to the output of the neuron. If we take the example of a really simple Heaviside step function which assigns a 0 to any negative value and a 1 to any positive value, then a large number of neurons would be required to achieve the required granularity of slowly adjusting the weights to reach an acceptable consensus of the training set.
            </p>

            <p>
            As we will see in the next section on back-propagation, this concept of slowly adjusting the weights can be represented mathematically as the slope of the activation function. In biological terms, it can be thought of as the increase in firing rate that occurs as input current increases. If we were to use a linear function instead of the Heaviside function, then we would find that the resulting network would have an unstable convergence because neuron inputs along favored paths would tend to increase without bound, as a linear function is not normalizable.
            </p>

            <p>
            All problems mentioned above can be handled by using a normalizable sigmoid activation function. One realistic model stays at zero until input current is received, at which point the firing frequency increases quickly at first, but gradually approaches an asymptote at 100% firing rate. Mathematically, this looks like:
            $$ \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $$
            </p>

            <p>
            If plotted on a graph, the Sigmoid function draws an S shaped curve:
            </p>

            <p><img alt="sigmoid plot" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-sigmoid-plot.png" width="450"></p><p>
            Thus, the final formula for the output of a neuron now becomes
            $$ Output = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\sum weight_i . input_i)}} $$
            </p>

            <p>
            There are other normalization functions that we can use but the sigmoid has the advantage of being fairly simple and also having a simple derivative which will be useful when we look at the back propagation below.
            </p>

            <h5 id="back-propagation">Back-propagation</h5>

            <p>
            During the training cycle, we adjusted the weights depending on the error. To do this, we can use the "Error weighted derivative" formula
            $$ Adjustment = error . input . SigmoidCurveGradient(output) $$
            </p>

            <p>
            The reason we use this formula is that firstly, we want to make the adjustment proportional to the size of the error. Secondly, we multiply by the input, which is either a 0 or a 1. If the input is 0, the weight isn’t adjusted. Finally, we multiply by the gradient of the Sigmoid curve (or the derivative).
            </p>

            <p>
            The reason that we use the gradient is because we are trying to minimize the loss. Specifically, we do this by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent method</a>. It basically means that from our current point in the parameter space (determined by the complete set of current weights), we want to go in a direction which will decrease the loss function. Visualize standing on a hillside and walking down the direction where the slope is steepest. The gradient descent method as applied to our neural net is illustrated as follows:
            </p><ol>
                <li>If the output of the neuron is a large positive or negative number, it signifies the neuron was quite confident one way or another.</li>
                <li>From the sigmoid plot, we can see that at large numbers the Sigmoid curve has a shallow gradient.</li>
                <li>Thus, if the neuron is confident that the existing weight is correct, it doesn’t want to adjust it very much and multiplying by the gradient of the sigmoid curve achieves this.</li>
            </ol>
            

            <p>
            The derivative of the sigmoid function is given by the following formula
            $$ SigmoidCurveGradient(output) = output . (1 - output) $$
            Substituting this back into the adjustment formula gives us
            $$ Adjustment = error . input . output . (1 - output) $$
            </p>

            <h5 id="code">Code</h5>

            <p>
            An important but subtle point that was missed out when explaining the mathematics above was that for each training iteration, the mathematical operations are done on the entire training set at the same time. Thus, we will make use of matrices to store the set of input vectors, the weights and the expected outputs.
            </p>

            <p>
            You can grab the entire project source here: <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/neuralnet">https://github.com/wheresvic/neuralnet</a>. For the sake of learning, we implemented all the math ourselves using only the standard java Math functions :)
            </p>

            <p>
            We will begin with the <code>NeuronLayer</code> class which is just a placeholder for the weights in our neural net implementation. We provide it with the number of inputs per neuron and the number of neurons which it can use to build a table of the weights. In our current example, this is very simply the last output neuron which has the 3 input neurons.
            </p>

<pre>public class NeuronLayer {

    public final Function<double, double=""> activationFunction, activationFunctionDerivative;

    double[][] weights;

    public NeuronLayer(int numberOfNeurons, int numberOfInputsPerNeuron) {
        weights = new double[numberOfInputsPerNeuron][numberOfNeurons];

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfInputsPerNeuron; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; numberOfNeurons; ++j) {
                weights[i][j] = (2 * Math.random()) - 1; // shift the range from 0-1 to -1 to 1
            }
        }

        activationFunction = NNMath::sigmoid;
        activationFunctionDerivative = NNMath::sigmoidDerivative;
    }

    public void adjustWeights(double[][] adjustment) {
        this.weights = NNMath.matrixAdd(weights, adjustment);
    }
}
</double,></pre>

            <p>
            Our neural net class is where all the action happens. It takes as a constructor the <code>NeuronLayer</code> and has 2 main functions:
            </p><ul>
                <li><code>think</code>: calculates the outputs of a given input set</li>
                <li><code>train</code>: runs the training loop <code>numberOfTrainingIterations</code> times (usually a high number like 10,000). Note that the training itself involves calculating the output and then adjusting the weights accordingly</li>
            </ul>
            

<pre>public class NeuralNetSimple {

    private final NeuronLayer layer1;
    private double[][] outputLayer1;

    public NeuralNetSimple(NeuronLayer layer1) {
        this.layer1 = layer1;
    }

    public void think(double[][] inputs) {
        outputLayer1 = apply(matrixMultiply(inputs, layer1.weights), layer1.activationFunction);
    }

    public void train(double[][] inputs, double[][] outputs, int numberOfTrainingIterations) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTrainingIterations; ++i) {

            // pass the training set through the network
            think(inputs);

<p>When your father suffers a heart attack and needs emergency surgery, who would you rather have operating on him?</p>



<p>An inspiring doctor who lost an arm in a tragic car accident, and still heroically manages to attain an average level of success as a surgeon?<br>Or the son of a multimillionaire who has breezed through life with minimal setbacks, and boasts one of the best surgical track records?</p>



<hr>



<p>There is a common perception that a meritocracy is the most fair way to run society. That because we are avoiding bias and favoritism and picking candidates purely based on their capabilities and achievements, a meritocratic system is the most fair of all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such a belief is hogwash. There’s nothing “fair” about not selecting the surgeon who lost his arm in a car accident, and is now trying desperately to hold on to his career. There’s nothing fair about the fact that some people are born into good circumstances which confer a tremendous headstart in life. There’s nothing fair about the fact that so many of society’s most accomplished individuals grew up in upper-middle-class families that nurtured them, raised them well, and gave them access to highly regarded schools and teachers.</p>



<p>A meritocracy never was, and never will be, “fair”. <strong>And that’s the whole point.</strong></p>



<p>The reason meritocracies work so well, is not because they are fair, but because they produce peak performance.</p>



<p>NFL teams draft the “best” players they can find, because they know that’s how they can win the most games. Universities grant tenure to the most productive professors, because that will best enhance the University’s reputation, and further the frontiers of knowledge. Hospitals hire the best doctors, because they can save the most lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hiring people who are “good enough” is simply not good enough. There has never been, and never will be, a team that won the world cup by selecting players who are “good enough.” And what’s true for a kid’s game, is doubly true for our society. A society should delegate its jobs to those who are smartest, most capable, and most accomplished in that field. Because they are the ones who can best lead society through the worldly challenges we face everyday. Corrupting this process by discriminating on the basis of family ties, personal friendships, wealth, race, or gender, is simply cutting your nose to spite your face.</p>



<p>Which is not to say that “fairness” and Social Justice isn’t important. It is vital. But you don’t get to it by hiring less qualified candidates. By turning down the best possible candidate in favor of someone who is more sympathetic and “good enough”. A meritocracy excels at producing wealth and economic prosperity. Universal basic income, universal healthcare, unemployment insurance, better public schooling and free job trainings… these are the kind of Social Justice programs that can share the resulting prosperity among everyone.</p>



<p>Social justice teaches us how to distribute the pie fairly, so that no one is left behind. This is absolutely essential, and something we should always keep in mind. But social justice doesn’t have all the answers on how to grow the pie in the first place. And unless we harness the power of a meritocracy to keep the pie growing, we will all soon be fighting over scraps.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25485766" target="_blank"><em>Discussion thread on HackerNews</em></a></p>



<p><em><strong>Addendum</strong>: This article’s thesis is that we should select/hire candidates who will perform best in the role, regardless of their personal circumstances. Many have mentioned that traditional methods of assessment may be flawed, incomplete, or biased. In accordance with the thesis, we should certainly strive to refine our assessment methods, and continually make them more accurate. This article is certainly not stating that current methods of assessment are perfect.</em></p>



<p><em>Many have also brought up the point that personal circumstances often do impact job performance. For example, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/diversity-work-group-performance" target="_blank">some studies have suggested that diverse teams perform better than homogenous teams</a>, especially in certain job roles. If you are an ardent believer in improving team performance, this would mean taking into account any demographic info that would help the organization perform better. This is also a double-edged sword for a couple reasons:<br>1. By legalizing the use of race or gender as a factor in hiring decisions, you would also be enabling prejudiced employers who discriminate against women or minorities, for purely bigoted reasons<br>2. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/" target="_blank">Studies have also found that communities operate better in some ways, when they are more homogenous</a>. If more such studies are unearthed in future, the same reasoning above could be used to justify discriminating against all women and people of color. Something most of us, including myself, would consider to be dystopian.</em></p>

<p>Raspberry Pi Rack Server Mark I и Mark II have been working pretty nice for 6 month already. Both of them are based on a model which I found on <a href="https://thingiverse.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://thingiverse.com">thingiverse.com</a> and inherited the basic design idea.</p>



<p>With Mark III, I completely rethought the design, which allowed to:</p>



<ul><li>increase the number of raspberries in 2 rack units</li><li>significantly reduce printing time and plastic consumption</li><li>significantly reduce the time required for assembling and disassembling the server</li><li>reduce the number of parts</li><li>implement a modular design, which means that MARK III will be available in various modifications</li></ul>



<p>I’m glad to present the first basic model, designed for 14x of Raspberry Pi and 14x of a standard 2.5″ SSD.</p>



<p>BTW I will be glad if you subscribe to my instagram <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/uptime.lab/" target="_blank">instagram.com/uptime.lab</a> your feedback and likes are very important for me!</p>

								• updated on December 19, 2020  
								• ID 86 —</p><p>An experimental Forward Iterator written from scratch to boost up hand-made containers.</p><div>
				
<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<p>An iterator is an object that points to an element inside a container. Like a pointer, an iterator can be used to access the element it points to and can be moved through the content of the container. Each container in the C++ Standard Library provides its own iterator, as well as some methods to retrieve it. Using iterators is quite easy: obtain an instance from a container, move it around where needed and then get the pointed element.</p>
<p>Concretely, an iterator is a simple class that provides a bunch of operators: increment <code>++</code>, dereference <code>*</code> and few others which make it very similar to a pointer and the arithmetic operations you can perform on it. In fact, iterators are a generalization of pointers, which are often used as a foundation when writing the iterator itself.</p>
<p>Iterators are one of the building blocks of the Standard Library containers, but they are also useful when you want to provide the ability to iterate over elements of a custom container that you wrote yourself: this is what I want to investigate in the present article. Adding iterators to your containers will make them compatible with the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for">range-based for loops</a> and the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm">C++ Algorithms library</a>: a collection of functions for searching, sorting, counting and manipulating containers, based on iterators.</p>
<h2>A dummy container for our experiments</h2>
<p>Before digging deeper, let's define a silly custom container that we want to spice up with iterators:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
private:
    int m_data[200];
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Integers</code> class is a wrapper around a raw array of <code>int</code>s: we want to be able to access elements of that private array through an iterator, as well as to loop over it or pass it to any of the Standard Library algorithms. Let's start by making some design decisions.</p>
<h2>Choose the nature of our iterator</h2>
<p>The first step is to choose the type of iterator we want to implement. Modern C++ defines six types:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>#</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/InputIterator">Input Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward only once, can't change the value it points to (read-only);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/OutputIterator">Output Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward only once, can't read the value it points to (write-only);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ForwardIterator">Forward Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward multiple times, can read and write the value it points to;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/BidirectionalIterator">Bidirectional Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Same as previous one but can scan the container back and forth;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/RandomAccessIterator">Random Access Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Same as previous one but can access the container also non-sequentially (i.e. by jumping around);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousIterator">Contiguous Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Same as previous one, with the addition that logically adjacent elements are also physically adjacent in memory.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The six categories are hierarchical: a Bidirectional Iterator is also a Forward Iterator and a Random Access Iterator is both a Bidirectional and a Forward Iterator and so on. Normally, all iterators are Input Iterators (1) which makes them read-only, also known as <strong>constant iterators</strong>. Iterators that both support read and write operations are also Output Iterators (2) and are called <strong>mutable iterators</strong>.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monocasual/internalpointers-files/master/2020/12/iterators/iterator-hierarchy.png" alt="Iterators hierarchy"></p><p>1. Iterators hierarchy in C++. All iterators are Input Iterators, Output Iterators or both.</p>
</div><p>Input and Output iterators are often used for low-level components such as input and output streams (the so-called <strong>single-pass algorithms</strong>) and thus have limitations. We want to do more with our custom container, so we will skip those two and jump straight to the mutable Forward Iterator.</p>
<h2>Prepare the custom iterator</h2>
<p>An iterator is usually declared inside the class it belongs to, for example:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:
    struct Iterator { /* ... */ };

    // ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing to do is to assign the iterator some properties. Until C++17 this is done by <em>tagging</em> it with the <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/04/27/tag-dispatching/"><strong>tag dispatch</strong></a> mechanism, while C++20 uses <strong>concepts</strong>: in this article I will follow the traditional approach.</p>
<p>C++ expects some properties from an iterator:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>iterator_category</code> — one of the six iterator categories we have seen above. The full list is available <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_tags">here</a>. The <code>std::forward_iterator_tag</code> tag is what we need;</li>
<li><code>difference_type</code> — a signed integer type that can be used to identify distance between iterator steps. Our iterator is basically a wrapper around a pointer and leverages pointer arithmetic, so the default <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/ptrdiff_t"><code>std::ptrdiff_t</code></a> is a good choice;</li>
<li><code>value_type</code> — the type the iterator iterates over. <code>int</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>pointer</code> — defines a pointer to the type iterated over. <code>int*</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>reference</code> — defines a reference to the type iterated over. <code>int&amp;</code> in our case;</li>
</ul>
<p>Translated into code:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iterator&gt; // For std::forward_iterator_tag
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;  // For std::ptrdiff_t

struct Iterator 
{
    using iterator_category = std::forward_iterator_tag;
    using difference_type   = std::ptrdiff_t;
    using value_type        = int;
    using pointer           = int*;  // or also value_type*
    using reference         = int&amp;;  // or also value_type&amp;
};
</code></pre>
<h3>Why are tags useful?</h3>
<p>Some of the tags above might seem useless at first. In fact, you will notice how they will never get mentioned during the definition of our iterator. Tags are used to select the most efficient algorithm if your container is passed to one of the Standard Library functions from the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> library. Wrong tags mean sub-optimal performance! The iterator category is also used to set algorithm requirements, for example: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> wants a Forward Iterator, while <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/reverse"><code>std::reverse</code></a> wants a Bidirectional Iterator. Passing the wrong iterator will result in a compilation error.</p>
<h2>Define the iterator constructors</h2>
<p>All iterators must be <em>constructible</em>, <em>copy-constructible</em>, <em>copy-assignable</em>, <em>destructible</em> and <em>swappable</em>. Let's translate those requirements into code for our iterator:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    Iterator(pointer ptr) : m_ptr(ptr) {}

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Easy! We just need a custom constructor to initialize the private member variable <code>m_ptr</code>, which points to an element of the <code>Integers</code> container. The custom constructor satisfies the <em>constructible</em> requirement, while all others are covered by the implicitly-declared constructors and operators kindly provided by the compiler.</p>
<h2>Implement operators</h2>
<p>We are building a mutable Forward Iterator, which inherits properties from both Input and Output Iterators. The resulting iterator must support the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>*iterator</code> and <code>iterator-&gt;x</code> — dereferenceable, to get the value it points to;</li>
<li><code>++iterator</code> and <code>iterator++</code> — incrementable, to move it one step forward, both prefix and postfix versions. The latter must return something dereferenceable;</li>
<li><code>iterator_a == iterator_b</code> and <code>iterator_a != iterator_b</code> — comparable with another iterator;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done by implementing some custom operators in the <code>Iterator</code> class, like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    // Iterator constructors here...

    reference operator*() const { return *m_ptr; }
    pointer operator-&gt;() { return m_ptr; }

    // Prefix increment
    Iterator&amp; operator++() { m_ptr++; return *this; }  

    // Postfix increment
    Iterator operator++(int) { Iterator tmp = *this; ++(*this); return tmp; }

    friend bool operator== (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr == b.m_ptr; };
    friend bool operator!= (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr != b.m_ptr; };     

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see every operator involves the usage of the private pointer <code>m_ptr</code>. Also, notice the <code>friend</code> declaration for the two comparison operators: this is handy way to define the operators as non-member functions, yet being able to access private parts of the <code>Iterator</code> class (rationale  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421706/what-are-the-basic-rules-and-idioms-for-operator-overloading/4421729#4421729">here</a>).</p>
<h2>Prepare the container</h2>
<p>Our iterator is good to go. The last step is to give our custom container the ability to create <code>Iterator</code> objects. This is done by adding two public methods <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> that return instances of the <code>Iterator</code> class, representing the first and the last element respectively:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:

    // Iterator definition here ...

    Iterator begin() { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[0]); }
    Iterator end()   { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[200]); } // 200 is out of bounds
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>end()</code> method returns an iterator that refers to an <em>invalid</em> memory address, past the end of our raw array. Such iterator is just a placeholder used to determine when the boundary has been reached: it should never be accessed directly.</p>

<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<h2>Time to test our iterator</h2>
<p>Both the custom container and its iterator are now ready. Let's test them with the range-based for loop:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;
for (auto i : integers)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
</code></pre>
<p>This code will magically print the value of each integer in the container. It works because the range-based for loop is just syntactic sugar created by the compiler for the following:</p>
<pre><code>for (auto it = integers.begin(), end = integers.end(); it != end; ++it) { 
    const auto i = *it; 
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
}
</code></pre>
<p>In words: two iterators <code>it</code> and <code>end</code> are created. The first one points to the beginning of the container, the other one points to the end. Then, on each loop, the <code>it</code> iterator is incremented until it's equal to <code>end</code>, that is until the end of the container has been reached. The actual value is obtained by dereferencing <code>it</code> in a local variable before being printed.</p>
<p>Notice how the compiler makes use of all the operators and functions we have previously implemented: the <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> methods in the custom container, the ability to compare the two iterators with the <code>!=</code> operator, the ability to increment <code>it</code> with the prefix syntax and finally the ability to dereference it to grab the actual value it points to.</p>
<p>Let's now try a function from the Algorithm library, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> for example:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;

std::fill(integers.begin(), integers.end(), 3);
</code></pre>
<p>The function assigns all elements in the container the value <code>3</code>. It works because <code>std::fill</code> is usually implemented like this:</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;typename ForwardIterator, …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While exploring D recently, I remembered a game I played while at university 15 years ago. For a long time, I couldn’t remember the name at all, only that it was from a Japanese developer. After some search wrangling, I finally managed to find the name of the game: <strong>Torus Trooper!</strong></p>
<p>You can find it there: <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/tt_e.html">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/tt_e.html</a></p>
<p><img src="https://speps.fr/media/articles/tt1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is a copy of the tt0_22.zip file archived: <a href="https://github.com/speps/tt/archive/legacy.zip">https://github.com/speps/tt/archive/legacy.zip</a></p>
<p>What made me remember this game is that :</p>
<ul>
<li>It came with <a href="https://github.com/speps/tt/tree/legacy/src/abagames">source code</a>, quite unusual at the time for me</li>
<li>Written in D, a language I didn’t know at all while I was busy studying C++</li>
<li>It’s awfully addictive!</li>
</ul>
<p>What better project than try to compile a <strong>D v0.110</strong> project in a modern version of D and possibly porting the game to WebAssembly+WebGL! So here we are…</p>
<h2 id="switching-from-ant-to-dub">Switching from Ant to DUB</h2>
<p>The game used Ant and its <code>build.xml</code> file to generate the executable, resources, etc. Since then, D added DUB as a build system / package manager so let’s use that!</p>

</div><p>I did try a few searches without success so I asked on the D community forums and a few people guessed right, it’s of course a <code>not &gt;=</code>, equivalent to <code>&lt;</code>. However, <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/rec3d1$toc$1@digitalmars.com">thanks to Walter Bright</a>, I got a link to the <a href="https://www.digitalmars.com/ctg/ctgNumerics.html#comparisons">original documentation from Digital Mars</a>. The subtle difference with <code>!&gt;=</code> is that it will also return <code>true</code> if any operands are <code>NaN</code>. Suggested fix seems to have worked:</p>

<p>D1 used to have <code>char[]</code> as the string type, and functions in <code>std.string</code> in Phobos to manipulate this type. D2 replaced this with an <code>alias string = immutable(char)[]</code>. As a result, a lot of the code needs updating to deal with this. That includes the code in the custom bindings.</p>
