<p>Do surgeries work? Most of us assume they do, but is there any scientific evidence that they do?</p>

<p>In this episode, I talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/drianharris">Dr Ian Harris</a> who is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Australia. He is a practicing orthopedic surgeon specializing in trauma surgery. Outside his practice, his research interests broadly cover the topic of surgical effectiveness and clinical research.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Notes and key insights</h3>

<p>1/ <strong>What is a placebo surgery?</strong> It’s where you make an incision but not do anything. </p>

<p>It’s analogous to traditional placebo in medicine, where a sugar or salt pill is given instead of an active chemical to see whether the intended medicine has an actual impact.</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Majority of surgeries that Dr Ian Harris and other researchers have studied in fact are not more effective than placebos</strong>. This is shocking because even when we have no proof that they work, many of these surgeries are happening even today.</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Examples of such ineffective surgeries include back pain surgeries and knee pain surgeries.</strong> For such surgeries, randomized control trials have found that if you make an incision in the knee but don’t do anything, it’s as effective as actually conducting the surgery of the knee.</p>

<p>4/ Why do patients get better if the surgery doesn’t work? It’s because<strong> many diseases or pain have a natural progression</strong>, and we generally seek surgical/medicinal intervention when we’re in the worst condition. If the body heals / condition becomes better after that, we attribute improvement to the intervention rather than thinking it could have happened anyway (due to the natural course of the condition).</p>

<p>5/ As Dr Ian Harris said, the unsaid attitude could be stated like: “<strong>you have to operate on patients quickly before they get better</strong>“.</p>

<p>Remember: in many cases, if you get sick, you get better after that. And that is why placebos seem to work.</p>

<p>6/ It’s shocking to hear that randomized controlled trials (RCT) for many surgical interventions end up finding that they’re ineffective.</p>

<p>But what’s most shocking is that <strong>many other interventions have never been subjected to an RCT against a placebo</strong>. For many of the common procedures traditionally practiced, we don’t know whether they work at all or not.</p>

<p>7/ For sure, there are many studies that study variations of surgical methods. That is, they try to find out whether an incision from the left is better or from the right. </p>

<p>But very few studies try to find out whether the incision does anything at all for the patient. Shocking, but that’s the truth.</p>

<p>8/ In that sense, <strong>surgery is different than medicine</strong>. All new pharmaceutical molecules are subjected to rigorous clinical trials where they’re tested against placebo or doing nothing. In many countries, there’s no such procedure for surgical treatments. If there is a procedure for new surgical procedures, nobody is testing old ones that have been getting performed every day without evidence.</p>

<p>8/ If research indicates many of the currently practiced surgeries don’t work, why are they still practiced?</p>

<p>Well, <strong>if your salary depends on not believing something, you won’t believe it.</strong></p>

<p>9/ And such <strong>denial is not new</strong>. The most common surgical procedure in history was bloodletting. This practice which lasted for thousands of years was only questioned in mid 19th century, and even after randomized trials showed that it hurt the patient, it wasn’t abandoned suddenly. It died a slow death as its practitioners started dying. </p>

<p>10/ Even today, the fact that practices like Homeopathy survive suggests that <strong>seeking evidence of what works isn’t a big priority for society</strong>. Perhaps keeping traditions is a bigger priority.</p>

<p>11/ But because it’s costly and risky to perform surgeries, the urgent question is: <strong>what surgical procedures are today’s equivalent of bloodletting</strong>? And those that we know are bloodletting, how do we get rid of them as a society?</p>

<p>12/ As a patient, what should you do? Dr Ian Harris recommends that every time your doctor recommends a medical procedure, <strong>ALWAYS ask for risks and benefits</strong>. </p>

<p>Risks are a given and doctors generally are happy to talk about them. But nobody asks for benefits because they’re assumed to be there. </p>

<p>Ask and confirm about benefits explicitly.</p>

<p>13/ What if the pain isn’t going away at all? Should you then get surgery?</p>

<p>Golden advice by Dr Ian -&gt;  “<strong>the severity of your symptoms does not change the effectiveness of the operation</strong>“</p>

January 20, 2021 | https://jakobgreenfeld.com/metrics | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jakobgreenfeld.com/metrics">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Let’s say my goal this year is to get to 10k monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>

<p>MRR first, everything else second. I would ruthlessly cut out all activities that don’t lead to a measurable MRR increase. For example, I would stop writing blog posts like the one you’re currently reading. I certainly wouldn’t create fun projects like What to Tweet or take the time for non-transactional Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I would focus on my revenue generating projects, crank up the advertising machinery and do everything I can think of that potentially increases my MRR.
I’m fairly confident that I would reach 10k MRR by the end of the year. But at what price?</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back for a second.</p>

<p>You know who manages by metrics? Big companies like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>And what do they have in common?</p>

<p>Their core product got notably worse over time.</p>

<p>Google’s search results are dominated by ads and many users now use workarounds to find what they’re looking for (“Best headphone reddit”). LinkedIn looks like Minesweeper. Facebook was a fun place to meet friends. And if you search for an electronics product on Amazon, you immediately feel like you’re at a flea market in the middle of Shenzhen.
This is the result of hundreds of decisions that were motivated by a short-term focus on specific metrics like revenue and click rates. And while these decisions most likely optimized the metrics, they made the user experience worse.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t have the technology to measure the right thing. Or maybe the “right thing” is inherently immeasurable.</p>

<p>Or, and that’s my personal favorite, we’re dealing with a Schrödinger’s cat like situation. The “right thing” is only the right thing as long as we’re not trying to optimize it.
This is known as Goodhart’s law. “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.“</p>

<p>Let’s consider another example.</p>

<p>Who else manages by metrics? Politicians!</p>

<p>Instead of some boring historic example (there are plenty, just read “Seeing like a State”), I’m going to spice things up by talking about something that’s happening right now.
It’s not hard to anticipate what I want to talk about since there’s precisely one thing that’s currently happening: Covid-19.</p>

<p>Politicians try to manage the situation by focusing on metrics like the “R number”. At least here in Germany the motto is: let’s lower the R number at all costs.
Turns out the cost of this strategy is incredibly high. It’s just not immediately measurable.</p>

<p>For example, everyone’s getting fatter since all gyms and sport clubs are closed. Most people are developing unhealthy eating habits because there’s simply nothing else to do. Social connections are rapidly degregating even though everyone knows how important they’re for the human wellbeing.</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor and don’t play one on the internet, but I can easily imagine that there are lots of further unintended consequences of the current lockdown policy. For example, since most people now spend most of their time indoors alone and wear masks when they leave their homes, their immune system isn’t stressed regularly like it usual is. Hence I wouldn’t be surprised if many people will get sick of other diseases once the lockdown ends as a result of weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I’m all for taking Covid seriously. In fact, I’ve been hoarding masks since 2009. I spent the summer of 2009 with a bunch of friends in Lloret de Mar (a party hotspot in Spain) just when news of the swine flu started to emerge. Long story short, everyone in our group got sick (20+ people) except for my girlfriend and me because we’ve been wearing masks.
Now the most famous example how focusing on metrics can have unhealthy consequences is the cobra effect. I’ll just quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term cobra effect originated in an anecdote that describes an occurrence during India under British rule. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one more example I always have to talk about when the topic comes up: academia.</p>

<p>Stagnation apologists love to argue that the lack of progress in science is simply a result of the fact that all low-hanging fruit are gone.</p>

<p>That’s complete nonsense. There’s still plenty of low-hanging fruit. It’s just that everyone is so busy chasing meaningless metrics that they can’t see them.</p>

<p>In academia the metric of choice usually has something to do with the number of citations. But just like Google’s backlink-driven algorithm (which was in fact inspired by academia’s citation metrics) was quickly gamed by savvy webmasters, academia’s algorithm is gamed by careerists.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about some tiny minority here. If you want to survive in academia, you have to play the citation game. And if everyone is cheating, at the very least you have to do the same to stand a chance.</p>

<p>You have to partner up with others because five people can write five times as many papers. You agree to constantly cite each other. Likewise, you focus on incremental additions to established ideas because that’s the safest way to new publications regularly. You work on the stuff everyone else is working on because how else are you going to get citations?</p>

<p>And one thing you absolutely have to avoid like the plague is the risky and deep kind of research that leads to real progress in the field.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that citations are a bad metric, and we need to come up with smarter ones. Instead, it’s just Goodhart’s law in action.
Every attempt to manage academia makes it worse.</p>

<p>As soon a new metric is introduced it will misdirect the attention of scientists towards playing the game, instead of progressing science.</p>

<p>I talked about three areas, but the same pattern occurs almost everywhere. For example, just remember when everyone started minimizing fat in their diet or how grades are used to measure “learning”.</p>

<p>Crucially the problem is not the specific metric that’s being used. Whatever new metric gets introduced will soon again be made useless by Goodhart’s law. The metrics game will always be akin to Whac-A-Mole.</p>

<p>Now where does this leave us? If management by metrics doesn’t work, what else should we do?</p>

<p>First of all, I think that looking at metrics can be helpful. They just shouldn’t be the sole yardstick decisions are measured against.</p>

<p>And while the map never will be the territory, the picture you’re looking at gets more accurate the more metrics you consider. For example, if politicians would not just consider the R number but hundreds of metrics that take different aspects of a population’s wellbeing into account, the decisions would be better ones.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that decisions become much harder if you consider more than one metric.</p>

<p>But more importantly there are so many factors we can’t measure that nevertheless should be taken into account.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I become convinced that it all boils down to talking to people.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about surveys that distill thousands of standardized “conversations” into a few numbers or analytics tools that do similar things for behavior. I’m talking about real one-on-one interactions.</p>

<p>Just imagine if Jeff Bezos would talk to hundreds of real (non pre-vetted) Amazon customers each month and take what he hears in these conversations seriously. Or if politicians would have long conversations with regular people from all wakes of life. Or if academic committees would actually talk to applicants before filtering them out based on citation metrics.</p>

<p>In our hyper rational world it’s extremely hard to justify decisions based on the mere gut feeling you got from a few conversations. But this is exactly what people should be doing.</p>

<p>Engagement metrics will never tell you if users are genuinely happy when they use your product. But a few genuine conversations will.</p>

<p>A resume will never tell you if a person is genuinely interested in uncovering unknown truths about nature. But a 30-minute conversation will.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s so much easier to reach a consensus if you just hire the candidate with the highest citation metrics or implement the feature that will lead to the largest revenue increase in the next quarter. But while it’s the easiest decision it’s usually not the best one.</p>

<p>And I think the same applies not just to managing organizations but also to managing ourselves.</p>

<p>Just by listening to my own body I’ll always know better than any fitness tracker if I slept well, better than any blood test if my diet is healthy, and better than my bank account if I’m happy.
That doesn’t mean that I’ll not use a fitness tracker, make regular blood tests, or check my bank account. But I certainly won’t allow them to dictate my decisions.</p>

<p>I’ll look at all the facts and take everything in, even the stuff that can’t be measured, and then I’ll just go with my gut.</p>

<p>Let me state up front that, while we’re going to be talking about an open source project that was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833206">recently submitted</a> to Hacker News’s “Show HN” section, the intent of this post is not at all to shame the developer who tried their damnedest to do the right thing. They’re the victim, not the culprit.</p>



<h2>RSA, Ya Don’t Say</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, an HN user shared <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet">their open source fork of a Facebook’s messenger client</a>, with added encryption. Their motivation was, as stated in the readme:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>It is known that <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-reads-messenger-messages/">Facebook scans your messages</a>. If you need to keep using Facebook messenger but care about privacy, Zuccnet might help.</p><p>It’s pretty simple: you and your friend have Zuccnet installed. Your friend gives you their Zuccnet public key. Then, when you send a message to your friend on Zuccnet, your message is encrypted on your machine before it is sent across Facebook to your friend. Then, your friend’s Zuccnet decrypts the message. Facebook never sees the content of your message.</p><p>I’m not a security person and there’s probably some stuff I’ve missed – any contributions are very welcome! This is <em>very</em> <strong>beta</strong>, don’t take it too seriously.</p></div><cite>From Zuccnet’s very humble README.</cite></blockquote>



<p>So far, so good. Facebook is abysmal for privacy, so trying to take matters into your own hands to encrypt data so Facebook can’t see what you’re talking about is, in spirit, a wonderful idea.</p>







<p>However, there is a problem with the <em>execution</em> of this idea. And this isn’t a problem unique to Zuccnet. Several times per year, I come across some well-meaning software project that makes the same mistake: Encrypting messages with RSA directly is bad.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet/blob/42e351e36b3b5dbaef06256ed11313fab77adb25/src/util/crypto.js#L57-L84">Zuccnet source code</a>:</p>


<pre title="">const encryptMessage = (message, recipientPublicKey) =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessage = crypto.publicEncrypt(
    {
      key: recipientPublicKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(message),
  );

  return encryptedMessage.toString("base64");
};

/**
 *
 * @param {String} encryptedMessage - base64 encoded string
 */
const decryptMessage = encryptedMessage =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessageBuffer = Buffer.from(encryptedMessage, "base64");
  const { privateKey } = getOrCreateZuccnetKeyPair();
  const message = crypto.privateDecrypt(
    {
      key: privateKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(encryptedMessageBuffer),
  );
};
</pre>


<p>To the Zuccnet author’s credit, they’re using OAEP padding, not PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This means their code isn’t vulnerable to Bleichenbacher’s 1998 padding oracle attack (n.b. most of the RSA code I encounter in the wild is vulnerable to this attack).</p>



<p>However, there are other problems with this code:</p>



<ol><li>If you try to encrypt a message longer than 256 bytes with a 2048-bit RSA public key, it will fail. (Bytes matter here, not characters, even for English speakers–because emoji.)</li><li>This design (encrypting with a static RSA public key per recipient) completely lacks forward secrecy. This is the same reason that <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP encryption sucks</a> (or, at least, one of the reasons PGP sucks).</li></ol>



<p>There are many ways to work around the first limitation.</p>



<p>Some cryptography libraries let you treat RSA as a block cipher in <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/">ECB mode</a> and encrypt each chunk independently. This is an incredibly stupid API deign choice: It’s slow (asymmetric cryptography operations are on the order of tens-to-hundreds-of-thousands times slower than symmetric cryptography) and you can drop/reorder/replay blocks, since ECB mode provides <em>no semantic security</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>much</strong> better strategy is to encrypt the data with a symmetric key, then encrypt <em>that key</em> with RSA. (See the <a href="#rsa-pkcs1">end of the post</a> for special treatment options that are especially helpful for RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.)</p>



<p>Working around the second problem usually requires an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE), similar to what I covered in my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/11/14/going-bark-a-furrys-guide-to-end-to-end-encryption/">Guide to End-to-End Encryption</a>. Working around this second problem <em>also</em> solves the first problem, so it’s usually better to just implement a forward-secret key exchange protocol than try to make RSA secure. </p>



<p>(You can get forward secrecy without an AKE, by regularly rotating keys, but AKEs make forward secrecy automatic and on-by-default without forcing humans to make a decision to rotate a credential– something most people don’t do unless they have to. AKEs trade user experience complexity for protocol complexity–and this trade-off is almost universally worth taking.)</p>



<p>Although AKEs are extremely useful, they’re a bit complex for most software developers to pick up without prior cryptography experience. (If they were easier, after all, there wouldn’t be so much software that encrypts messages directly with RSA in the first place.)</p>



<p>Note: RSA itself isn’t the reason that this lacks forward secrecy. The problem is how RSA is used.</p>



<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>



<h3>For Developers</h3>



<p>First, consider <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">not using RSA</a>. Hell, while you’re at it, <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">don’t write <em>any</em> cryptography code that you don’t have to</a>. </p>



<p>Libsodium (<a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages">which you should use</a>) does most of this for you, and can easily be turned into <a href="https://github.com/soatok/rawr-x3dh">an AKE comparable to the one Signal uses</a>. The less cryptography code you have to write, the less can go catastrophically wrong–especially in production systems.</p>



<p>If jettisoning RSA from your designs is a non-starter, you should at least consider taking the Dhole Moments Pledge for Software Developers:</p>



<blockquote><p>I will not encrypt messages directly with RSA, or any other asymmetric primitive.</p><cite>Simple enough, right?</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead, if you find yourself needing to encrypt a message with RSA, remind yourself that RSA is <em>for encrypting symmetric keys, not messages</em>. And then plan your protocol design accordingly.</p>



<p>Also, I’m pretty sure RSA isn’t random-key robust. Ask your favorite cryptographer if it matters for whatever you’re building.</p>



<p>(But seriously, you’re better off not using RSA at all.)</p>



<h3>For Cryptography Libraries</h3>



<p>Let’s ask ourselves, “Why are we forcing developers to know or even care about these details?”</p>



<p>Libsodium doesn’t encumber developers with unnecessary decisions like this. Why does the crypto module built into JavaScript? Why does the crypto module built into <em>most</em> programming languages that offer one, for that matter? (Go is a notable exception here, because their security team is awesome and forward-thinking.)</p>



<p>In my opinion, we should stop shipping cryptography interfaces that…</p>



<ul><li>Mix symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in the same API</li><li>Allow developers to encrypt directly with asymmetric primitives</li><li>Force developers to manage their own nonces/initialization vectors</li><li>Allow public/private keys to easily get confused (e.g. lack of type safety)</li></ul>



<p>For example: <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">Dhole Crypto</a> is close to my ideal for general-purpose encryption.</p>



<h3 id="rsa-pkcs1">Addendum: Securing RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5</h3>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Neil Madden informs me that what I wrote here is actually very similar to a standard construction called <a href="https://kel.bz/post/kem/">RSA-KEM</a>. You should use RSA-KEM instead of what I’ve sketched out, since that’s better studied by cryptographers.</p>



<p>(I’ve removed the original sketch below, to prevent accidental misuse.)</p>

<p>Today is the day I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law">Sturgeon’s law</a>:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Ninety percent of everything is crap.</p><cite>Sturgeon’s law</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I like this for a lot of reasons. But most of all, I like it as a nudge to try harder to enjoy things. </p>



<p>Think you hate poetry? Roller coasters? Banjo music? Thai food? Maybe you haven’t discovered the good 10% yet. Keep looking.</p>



<p>How about work? Think QA engineers are <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/04/dont-flip-the-bozo-bit/">useless</a>? Code review is a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">waste of time</a>? <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">Managers</a> hurt more than they help? Maybe you’ve been stuck with the crap 90% of them. Keep looking.</p>



<p>Then there’s relationships. Think there’s no one out there who can make you <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">happy</a>? Maybe you haven’t climbed out of your 90% of crappy relationships yet. Keep looking.</p>



<p>It reminds me of a <a href="https://ideopunk.com/2020/12/22/100-tips-for-a-better-life/">quote I read </a>recently:</p>



<blockquote><p>Keep your identity small. “I’m not the kind of person who does things like that” is not an explanation, it’s a trap. It prevents nerds from working out and men from dancing.&nbsp;</p><cite>Conor Barnes</cite></blockquote>



<p>Remember: <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/16/strong-opinions-loosely-held-sure-but-why/">strong opinions, loosely held</a>. If you think you hate something, hold that opinion loosely by putting it to the test. Try to prove it false. </p>



<p>Don’t be so quick to accept that something is not for you. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">Keep looking</a>.</p>

	<div>
		<p><span>As branding strategies evolve, tech companies continue to find ways to use white-labeling to create profitable apps. White-labeling refers to creating a foundational product or service that can be rebranded and further customized by other companies. This model </span><span>provides a way to service many brands with one product that still looks unique to end users. </span><span>In a previous blog post on </span><a href="https://www.inspiringapps.com/blog/mobile-industry/fintech-and-mobile-app-development/"><span>fintech and mobile app development</span></a><span>, we discussed the capacity of white-labeling to improve app integration and deliver data-driven tools. While there are many advantages associated with the decision to white-label a product, it is not without its challenges. We share our insights on the topic below. Learn how to use white-labeling to create profitable apps given the inherent strengths and limitations of the model.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Pros and Cons of White-labeling&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Although the practice of white-labeling apps exists across various industries, the business model for all brands is the same. Suppose you want to create a white-labeled “all resorts” app to service property management companies. This app would need to include features that appeal to virtually all resort managers. For example, the app could include the ability to view specific amenities of a resort upon selection. Property managers could further customize the app each time a resort is added to the product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although creating one product that services multiples resorts is </span>more efficient, this technique has its limitations. A significant con to white-labeling is the appearance of a lack of uniqueness. Using the all resorts app as an example, this product may be less appealing to individual resorts since they don’t want to be listed side-by-side in the same app with their competitors. Resorts would prefer to own their customer relationship and create the impression that they’ve done something unique to serve them.</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, the model benefits property managers because it is more efficient to maintain one app. It also simplifies things for users since they only need one app to access information about multiple resorts. White-labeled products also cut out the time and expense required to build users’ trust. Instead, companies deliver customized products to their existing loyal customer base. A customer who is familiar with a particular property management company is more likely to book a resort from its app. For this reason, white-labeling is especially useful to industries in which trust is paramount. This is why financial and medical institutions rely heavily on white-labeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Considerations for Developing a Profitable White-labeled Product&nbsp;</b></h3>
<h4><b>Limitations on brand-specific features&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>Limitations on brand-specific features substantially impact how producers use white-labeling to create profitable apps. Brands invariably request new features that may only be relevant to them. Offering no brand-specific customization is easiest for white-label providers. The more brand-specific features added to an app, the more difficult it is to maintain the app over time. It is tempting to individualize features in order to appease customers. The temptation is especially strong when a business is starting and revenue is especially critical. However, restricting the number of brand-specific features is key to profitability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The cost to develop a white-labeled product is relatively low at the start. Expenses grow over time as more brands (with more needs) are added to the platform. Ideally developers should strive to flatten out the expense curve so that the cost to add a new brand to the app is small. Setting limits on brand-specific customization is key to reaching this goal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Publishing Requirements&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The adoption of white-labeled products by multiple companies results in the availability of similar looking products that market themselves as being unique to a specific brand. This outcome inevitably presents a challenge to using white-labeling to create profitable digital products.&nbsp; It has also contributed to some pushback from Apple. Initially Apple chose to reject&nbsp; submissions from white-label providers</span><span>. Apple later relaxed its policy to allow white-labeled products to be created so long as each brand creates its own developer account and publishes its rebranded app through that account. This stipulation aims to strike a balance between Apple’s interest in an “app store cleanup” and the growing popularity of white-labeled products.&nbsp; Developers interested in creating profitable white-labeled products need to stay informed of these evolving restrictions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Adequate Specificity&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The design of white-labeled products needs to be general enough to be adopted by multiple brands yet specific enough to capitalize on niche markets and their goals. For example, </span><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-first-white-label-gaming-laptop-now-available-for-2200-will-be-adapted-by-resellers-like-Maingear-Schenker-and-Eluktronics.434609.0.html"><span>Intel used white-labeling to create a gaming laptop</span></a><span> that’s similar to a lot of other laptops but also has qualities that appeal to a specific market. The new product for gaming enthusiasts is conducive to white-labeling due to features including “</span><span>an advanced cooling system, excellent performance, great build quality, a light chassis, and shockingly good battery life.” The same connection between profitability and embodiment of a middle ground between generic and targeted features exists for white-labeled apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Alignment with Emerging Trends&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The most profitable white-labeled products provide services that are becoming increasingly popular. If relabeled products don’t reflect relevant trends, then they are unlikely to provide a launching point from which multiple brands can service a growing need. White-labeled products that are at the forefront of new trends are also able to acquire data that will become increasingly valuable over time. An example of a timely white-labeled product is<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fintech-junior-focus/cash-cards-for-kids-digital-banks-race-to-capture-the-next-generation-idINKBN27Y0RY"> Greenlight</a>, a debit card for kids that was recently white-labeled by Chase</span><span>. Fintech is now essential to personal banking. Therefore, apps that capitalize on this growing trend will be highly valuable to top brands.&nbsp;</span></p>

<![CDATA[The harmful assumptions we make about tasks]]>
            </title>
            <description>

January 20, 2021 | https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Most task managers make two assumptions. Do you make them too?</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A task manager needs to remember all of your tasks</em> <br>(Would you buy a task manager that lost data?)</li>
<li><em>All tasks can use a similar creation workflow</em> <br>(You hit the ‘create issue’ button, and fill in some fields. Simple, obvious, how could it be better?)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not obvious that they’re wrong—they actually seem <em>useful</em>. But both at work, and at home, making these assumptions will reduce your effectiveness.</p>
<p>And if you have trouble context-switching, procrastinate tasks, or have an ever-growing task backlog that looms over your head, these assumptions have likely caused you unnecessary pain.</p>
<p>Here’s how they hurt us, and how to stop it from happening.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-tasks-cause-fatigue">Permanent tasks cause fatigue</h2>
<p>Before starting Tandem, my manager Tim previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/01/yahoo-acquires-to-do-app-astrid/">Astrid</a>, a personal task manager, which he later sold to Yahoo.</p>
<p>At Astrid, Tim tried an interesting re-engagement email. Users who had been inactive for 6 weeks were asked: “want to delete all your tasks and start fresh?”</p>
<p>The hypothesis was that these inactive users had tasks that overwhelmed them. Either the amount, the complexity, or the low importance of backlogged tasks, caused users to put tasks off. So every time these users visited Astrid, they saw tasks they couldn’t do, felt bad, and eventually stopped visiting—procrastination in action. Astrid’s re-engagement email offered the users a chance to start fresh.</p>
<p>It was impressively compelling. Most re-engagement emails get a 1% response rate. This email had about 5%.</p>
<p>I imagine those users had the same feeling you get when you move from one browser to another, or from one task manager to another, and leave your bookmarks, open tabs, backlogged tasks, to start fresh in the name of increased productivity.</p>
<p>But simply deleting the backlog doesn’t end the cycle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nowadays, Tim uses a simpler task manager—a notebook. He uses a page a day, adds some tasks from JIRA, and when tasks come in during the day, he writes them down and works on them when he’s available. These are mostly small tasks, things that are easy to forget. If he gets a bug (important to track) or a task he can delegate, he puts it in JIRA.</p>
<p>The notebook isn’t meant to store issues forever. The pages get turned, and previous information becomes less accessible. So the next day, if he needs to carry over something that hasn’t been completed, he needs to make the conscious decision to do so.</p>
<p>This solution solves task-management fatigue. And incidentally, it solves another problem:</p>
<h2 id="not-all-tasks-are-created-the-same">Not all tasks are created the same</h2>
<p>There is a gap in task management. When we look at the tools used for tracking tasks and goals, there’s something for every level of the company:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Goal</th>
<th>Tool</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Company quarter-level</td>
<td>Quarterly Goals</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Org quarter-level</td>
<td>KPIs</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs, JIRA Epics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team sprint-level</td>
<td>Tickets</td>
<td>JIRA Tasks/Bugs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal day-level</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>???</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Except at the personal day-level, where you’re working on tickets, getting requests for feature updates from your PM, bug discoveries from QA, and breaking down your actual tickets into different tasks, which may require subtasks that weren’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One proposal is that you should track all of these tasks, no matter how small, in JIRA. But the teams I see successful at implementing this are those that can afford to work at a slower, more “enterprise” pace. Which isn’t a problem—at least for engineering—but it’s often not an option at smaller startups, when learning cycles must be fast.</p>
<p><em>Even if you work at a larger company, at a slower pace, you may relate when it comes to personal life: tasks come from a variety of directions, at all times. You can’t toss every minor task in a task manager.</em></p>
<p>You can’t fix every task before the next one comes in. If you only use JIRA, you choose between possibly forgetting these small tasks, or breaking your train of thought to search, categorize, and fill out a form every time you get a small task.</p>
<p>On the flip side, quickly writing these down in a temporary place means that <strong>you don’t need to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend mental effort remembering minor tasks,</li>
<li>or take significant time to file minor issues.</li>
<li>Have your task manager filled with minor issues you’ve forgotten to close,</li>
<li>or leave hastily-written issues for later, when you forget what the vaguely titled issue is for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="correcting-for-the-mistakes">Correcting for the mistakes</h2>
<p>The solution is not complicated: use a temporary, personal task manager.</p>
<p>Don’t go out and buy something new. You already have something you can use at home. Tim’s notebook is a good example. I personally message myself on Slack (and iMessage, for personal use).</p>
<details zgotmplz="">
<summary>An example of how I Slack myself</summary>
<div>
<h4 id="using-slack-for-daily-personal-tasks">Using Slack for daily personal tasks</h4>
<p>When I’m working, and get a non-urgent task that would otherwise interrupt me, it goes in my Slack DMs. This is what it looks like:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7647.jpg">
</p>
<p>Some days are quiet</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7644.jpg">
</p>
<p>And some are hectic</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the morning, to re-build yesterday’s context, I just look at yesterday’s list. If there are unfinished items, I can carry them over. But it’s a conscious decision. I don’t need to carry over optional, low-priority tasks.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a bad memory, there’s a huge benefit for team stand-ups. I used to write JQL filters to search JIRA (doesn’t work—and misses tasks), now I just take a look at Slack.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>The important requirements are just that your task manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires effort to carry over old tasks.</li>
<li>Makes writing down tasks quick.</li>
<li>Isn’t used for notes <em>(anecdotally, this adds noise, and forces you to parse notes from tasks)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a task is critical, long term, or requires cooperation, file it in your normal issue tracker. Otherwise, it’s probably a daily, personal task, and you can file it in here.</p>
<p>So take out a notebook, open Slack, pick what works for you. And see if you don’t feel calmer and more in control of your tasks.</p>

<p>I think these tools have interesting ideas to help individuals manage tasks.</p>
<h3 id="amna">Amna</h3>
<p>Ravi, my old college roommate and friend since high school, left Microsoft to build <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">Amna</a>, a personal task manager with tight browser integration.</p>
<p>I resonate with the thesis: recently I switched away from Firefox Tree Style Tabs, because I noticed that by organizing my tabs (which were part of tasks), it inadvertently became a de-facto task manager. But it wasn’t built for that!</p>
<p>Amna solves that exact problem: each task you do spawns a browser that keeps all of your relevant tabs.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna1.jpg">
</p>
<p>All the tabs in this browser window are related to the same task, and Amna keeps their state when I close the browser.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna2.jpg">
</p>
<p>After I'm done with a task, I can go back and look at the tabs I had open.</p>
</div>
<p>It helps prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle-memory opening HN, clicking an interesting blog post, and leaving it open “to read later” for several weeks</li>
<li>The pain of trawling through bookmarks and browser history, when you realize you forgot something</li>
<li>The clutter of leaving tabs open to prevent forgetting something</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve forgotten a time when you had less than five tabs open, <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">try using Amna</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jam">Jam</h3>
<p>Two of my ex-Cloudflare friends, Dani and Irtefa, started <a href="https://jam.dev/">Jam</a>. It’s probably the fastest way for PMs/designers to directly make comments on a website. So you get less minor interruptions, and more clarity on the requested change.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/jam2.jpg">
</p>
<p>All you do is type `jam` on the page, click an element, and type the comment</p>
</div>
<p>But I don’t include Jam here just for that. Jam also allows you to <a href="https://words.jam.dev/introducing-jam-wand/">offload the actual copy changes</a> to your PM, which flat-out decreases your minor tasks. If this sounds exciting, get on the waitlist <a href="https://jam.dev/">here</a>.</p>

For the last 2 years I’ve been working on a web browser that now cannot be completed because Google, the creators of the <em>open source</em> browser Chrome, won’t allow DRM in an <em>open source</em> project.</p><p>The browser I’m building, called <a href="https://github.com/samuelmaddock/metastream">Metastream</a>, is an Electron-based (Chromium derived), MIT-licensed browser hosted on GitHub. Its main feature is the ability to playback videos on the web, synchronized with other peers. Each client runs its own instance of the Metastream browser and transmits playback information to keep them in sync—no audio or video content is sent.</p><p>If someone is creating a browser that wants to playback media, they’ll soon discover the requirement of DRM for larger web media services such as Netflix and Hulu. There are a few DRM providers for the web including Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay.</p><p>As far as I’m aware, Widevine is the only available DRM for a Chromium-based browser, especially so for Electron. Chromium accounts for roughly <strong>70% market share</strong> of all web browsers, soon to include <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10">Microsoft’s upcoming Edge browser rewrite</a>. Waiting 4 months for a minimal response from a vendor with such a large percentage of the market is unacceptable.</p><p>This isn’t something I’m alone in either, <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12427">several Electron users</a> have waited months for a response.

  <p><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/guides/children.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you read our other blog posts you might already know that around 90% of the people on our planet are breathing dirty air, and that an estimate of 7 million people die every year due to it <span data-cites="world_health_organization_2018">[1]</span>. You might also know that nearly half a million babies died in 2019 due to dirty air <span data-cites="state_of_global_air">[2]</span>.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that dirty air is bad for both children and adults, but all this might be a bit abstract for a parent. This blog post will mainly look at how the air can impact the development of children and how the air quality relates to absenteeism in school, for both children and teachers.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-childrens-cognitive-development">Impact on Children’s Cognitive Development</h2>
<p>There are multiple studies indicating that poor air quality can have an negative impact on a child’s cognitive development.</p>
<p>In a study <span data-cites="wang_2017">[3]</span> carried out in Los Angeles and surrounding counties, it was found that for every increase 2.5µg/m<sup>3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub> during the pre-teen and teen years, one performance IQ point was lost. Performance IQ is related to ones ability to solve new problems, and it is to a greater extent controlled by brain function, as opposed to something you can learn <span data-cites="boyd-barrett_2018">[4]</span>.</p>
<p>In a report by Unicef <span data-cites="rees_2017">[5]</span> it is mentioned how air pollution can impact memory and verbal and non-verbal IQ. Furthermore, it is mentioned that test scores and average grades (GPA) have been shown to be negatively impacted by air pollution exposure. Also prenatal exposure is discussed. A study they mention showed that prenatal exposure to air pollution resulted in a four-point drop in IQ by the age of 5. In addition to this study, also <span data-cites="monica_2018">[6]</span> shows that exposure during fetal life can have negative consequences on brain development. Air pollution seems to haunt us throughout our whole lives, from foetus to when old (especially if you are male) <span data-cites="un_environment_2018">[7]</span>.</p>
One of the studies referenced in the Unicef report looked at 2,715 children between 7 and 10 years old in schools in Barcelona <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>. The study concludes <q>Children attending schools with higher traffic-related air pollution had a smaller improvement in cognitive development.</q>. However, the editor comments:
<blockquote>
Importantly, these findings do not prove that traffic-related air pollution causes impairment of cognitive development. Rather, they suggest that the developing brain may be vulnerable to traffic-related air pollution well into middle childhood, a conclusion that has implications for the design of air pollution regulations and for the location of new schools. <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>
</blockquote>
<p>In <span data-cites="emily_2018">[9]</span> researchers looked at children when they were 9 months old and then 3 years old. They observed that exposure to high levels of NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3. They also looked at indoor damp or condensation (which can be a hint for poor ventilation), and observed that it was associated with reduced verbal ability. Furthermore, they looked at exposure to second hand smoking, which perhaps unsurprisingly was also associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3 years.</p>
<p>Researchers have also looked at the commute to school and found that PM<sub>2.5</sub> and black carbon (BC) exposure was associated with diminished growth of working memory <span data-cites="alvarez_2017">[10]</span>.</p>
<p>The findings seem fairly consistent - dirty air is harmful. We therefore believe it is worth paying attention to the air quality in the environments where our children spend a large portion of their early lives. We can not eliminate air pollution exposure, but at least it can be reduced thorugh awareness and taking actions if needed.</p>
<p>Also IQAir has looked at this topic and written an article <q><a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/lp/blog/new-parents/can-clean-air-increase-child-iq">Can clean air increase child IQ?</a></q>. They found some of the same references as we, but also some others. We recommend you to have a look if you are curious about this topic.</p>
<h2 id="cleaner-air-leads-to-fewer-sick-days">Cleaner Air Leads to Fewer Sick Days</h2>
<p>Perhaps more concrete than air pollution’s impact on cognitive development is how it affect the number of sick days. This can naturally also in turn impact a child’s development, since day care (or school) is supposed to be a place where children both have fun and learn new things.</p>
<p>One study <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span> found that with air purification non-attendance was decreased by 55% in a preschool. Another experiment, also in a Swedish preschool, showed a reduced sick-leave of at least 22.5% <span data-cites="jagemo_2019">[12]</span>.</p>
<p>A school in Finland also observed reduced sick leave <span data-cites="genano">[13]</span>, as well as improved concentration, after installing air purifiers. However, we couldn’t find any numbers for how much.</p>
<p>In London, following the release of The Mayor’s School Air Quality Audit Programme <span data-cites="london">[14]</span>, a number of schools followed the recommendation to get air purifiers. 56 teachers were surveyed after getting air purifiers, and more than half of them reported having noticed a decrease in sick leave among themselves and children <span data-cites="blueair_2019">[15]</span>.</p>
<p>There is also some support for reduced absenteeism among teachers with better air quality, for instance <span data-cites="ervasti_2012">[16]</span> found such a connection. We will in the future look into absenteeism at workplaces and its relation to air quality. We suspect there will be more research about that than teachers specifically.</p>
<p>The Västra Götaland Regional Council in Sweden has observed large variations in sick leave among preschools and theorize that this might be due to differences in indoor air quality <span data-cites="vg_2017">[17]</span>. This is expanded on <span data-cites="gustafsson_2017">[18]</span> in Läkartidningen, the official Journal of the Swedish medical association. The doctors point out that the indoor air often has more particles than the outdoor air (in Sweden), both because of indoor activities and that small particles from traffic get in. Children are said to be especially vulnerable to air pollution. The doctors theorize that indoor pollution act as an additional burden on children’s immune system, which risks making it less able to cope with viruses.</p>
<p>Important to note is that many of the above references have links to companies with commercial interests. Sadly, it is hard to find studies without any ties to industry. We found at least two double-blind studies <span data-cites="reisman_1990">[19]</span> <span data-cites="weichenthal_2013">[20]</span> supporting health benefits of air pollution reduction through the usage of air purifiers though. Note that also the European Commission did a research project called SINPHONIE looking at improving air quality in schools and kindergartens. See the <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC91160/lbna26738enn.pdf">final report</a> for a deep dive into this topic. They also cover absenteeism, and on top of <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span>, they reference <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47620251_Association_between_substandard_classroom_ventilation_rates_and_students'_academic_achievement">Association between substandard classroom ventilation rates and students’ academic achievement</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11146405_Indoor_air_microbes_and_respiratory_symptoms_of_children_in_moisture_damaged_and_reference_schools">Indoor air microbes and respiratory symptoms of children in moisture damaged and reference schools</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45200045_The_Impact_of_School_Building_Conditions_on_Student_Absenteeism_in_Upstate_New_York">The Impact of School Building Conditions on Student Absenteeism in Upstate New York</a>. All in support for that there’s a link between air quality and absenteeism.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We believe there’s enough supportive evidence for it being worth to make sure that the indoor air quality is good (below <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health">WHO limits</a>), and if not, take action. We’ll try to write a new post in the future more focused on what one can do, but meanwhile, some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young child, pay attention to outdoor air pollution and consider an air purifier if pollution is high. It appears that air pollution may be more harmful the younger the child is.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider asking your preschool to get an air purifier if it is located close to heavy traffic or the air quality seems low. Some preschools are already aware of this, for instance <a href="http://eduwingskids.com/air-quality-in-eduwings-kindergarten/">Eduwings</a> have a strategy in place. Sadly it appears that mainly private expensive preschools are using air purifiers, at least in China <span data-cites="dandan_2016">[21]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce indoor activities that can lead to increased air pollution. For instance high temperature cooking, usage of candles or other indoor combustion. A well maintained kitchen hood and ventilation system can mitigate air pollution build-up. But you can also just open your window when cooking with high temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer walking in the forest or through a park rather than along roads with high traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>Install an app, such as <a href="https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-app">IQAir’s Air Visual</a>. It can help you to know when air pollution is high, so that you can reduce air pollution exposure. For instance by staying indoors the worst days, preferably in a room with an air purifier. Or at least avoiding heavy outdoor exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize second hand smoking, especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young children.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you enjoyed the article. As always, reach out to your doctor or other official services if you have any concerns about your or your families health.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Within the web development community, there has been a clear shift towards frameworks that implement incremental view maintenance and for good reason. When state is updated incrementally, applications perform better and require fewer resources. Using Materialize, developers and data analysts can adopt the same, event driven techniques in their data processing pipelines, leveraging existing SQL know-how. In this blog post, we will build an application to demonstrate how developers can create real-time, event-driven experiences for their users, powered by Materialize.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:<br>
This post is the fulfillment of the goals that I had when writing <a href="https://materialize.com/streaming-tail-to-the-browser-a-one-day-project/">Streaming TAIL to the Browser</a>. That post is not required to understand this post but familiarizing yourself with the <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/tail/#main">TAIL command</a> is recommended.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Demonstration of What We Will Be Building</h3>
<p>In this post, we are going to use the demo from our documentation’s <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/">Get Started tutorial</a> as the basis for building a minimal web application. The application allows users to see the total number of edits made to Wikipedia, as well as a bar chart of the top 10 editors. Here is an animation that shows the final result:</p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201766%201296%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10-live-1.gif" alt="" width="1766" height="1296"></p>
<hr>
<p>Want to run this demo yourself? Awesome! Clone our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize">repository</a> and follow the instructions for <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/ea5a6f0603875b752745838eb1228a90fc7e8476/play/wikirecent#running-it-yourself">Running it Yourself</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Desired Properties of the Solution</h3>
<p>Before jumping into how to build this, let’s outline the desired properties for our solution. The final solution should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push-Based</strong> – Instead of having the client poll for updates, updates should be initiated by the server and only when the client state is outdated.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> – Clients should present both a consistent and complete view of the data, regardless of when the application is loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Unbuffered</strong> – Clients should receive updates as soon as changes are made to the underlying datasets, without arbitrary delays in the data pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Economic</strong> – Size of updates should be a function of the difference between the current state and the desired state. Additionally, clients should not be required to replay state from the start of history.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> – Applications modifying the source data (writers) should not need to know anything about the applications consuming the data (readers).</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is possible for other applications to meet several of these properties, I hope that this application will demonstrate why the solution presented is ideal for this scenario. A discussion of why this application meets the above properties, and why other solutions likely do not, is presented further down in this post.</p>
<h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
<p>For those unfamiliar with our getting started demo, here is the flow of data in our pipeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Looking at the system diagram below, we see that the entire data pipeline is contained within a single materialized instance:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Let’s discuss the role of each service in the diagram above.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you started the application, you can run <code>mzcompose ps</code> to see the containers started.</p>
<hr>
<h4>curl — wikirecent_stream_1</h4>
<p>This container runs <code>curl</code> to stream Wikimedia’s recent changelog to a file called <code>recentchanges</code> within a Docker volume shared with our materialized instance.</p>
<h4>materialized — wikirecent_materialized_1</h4>
<p>This container runs an instance of <code>materialized</code>, configured to tail the <code>recentchanges</code> file and maintain our two materialized views: <code>counter</code> and <code>top10</code>. The views in this instance are configured exactly as documented in <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/#create-a-real-time-stream%22">Getting Started – Create a real-time Stream</a>.</p>
<h4>Python web server — wikirecent_app_1</h4>
<p>This container runs a Python web server that hosts the code for our JavaScript application and converts the row-oriented results from <code>TAIL</code> to the batch-oriented results expected by our application.</p>
<h2>Building Our Application</h2>
<p>Our example application is an asynchronous Python web server built using two libraries: <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/index.html">Tornado</a> and <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/">psycopg3</a>. There are three components to our application that I would like to call out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python code to subscribe to materialized view updates using the <code>TAIL</code> command and&nbsp;convert the row-oriented results into batches.</li>
<li>Python code to broadcast batches to listeners.</li>
<li>JavaScript code to apply batch updates for efficient browser updates.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Materialize uses the word <em>batch</em> to refer to a data structure that expresses the difference between prior state and desired state. You can think of a batch as a “data diff”.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Output for Our JavaScript Code</h3>
<p>To efficiently update our client view state, we wish to present a stream of batches over a websocket to any configured listeners. We define a batch as the following:</p>
<pre><code>batch = {"inserted": [ // array of rows to add to our dataset
],
"deleted": [ // array of rows to remove from our dataset
],
"timestamp": 0 // Materialize-defined timestamp
}
</code></pre>
<p>When a client first connects, we send a compacted view of all batches from the beginning of history:</p>
<pre><code>def add_listener(self, conn):
    """Insert this connection into the list that will be notified on new messages."""
    # Write the most recent view state to catch this listener up to the current state of the world
    conn.write_message(
        {
            "deleted": [],
            "inserted": self.current_rows,
            "timestamp": self.current_timestamp,
        }
    )
    self.listeners.add(conn) # subscribe to the stream of batches
</code></pre>
<p>How can listeners bootstrap their state using a batch object? If there is one property that I find particularly beautiful about this solution, it’s that first batch applied to an empty list <em>is</em> our initial state. This means that initializing and updating are the same operation. This batch object is so useful that D3’s <a href="https://d3js.org/#enter-exit">update</a> and Vega’s <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/#view_change">change</a> APIs expect updates to come in a similar form.</p>
<p>However, results from tail are row-oriented. We need a little bit of code to convert from rows to batches; here is an example of the desired conversion:</p>
<pre><code># We need to convert this stream of rows...
1608081358001 f -1 ['Lockal', '4590']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Epidosis', '4595']
1608081358001 f -1 ['Matlin', '5220']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Matlin', '5221']
1608081359001 t \N ['\\N', '\\N']

# ...to this data structure.
timestamp = 1608081358001
inserted = [('Epidosis', '4595'), ('Matlin', '5221')]
deleted = [('Lockal', '4590'), ('Matlin', '5220')]
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at the code to subscribe to view updates and transform rows into batches.</p>
<h3>Subscribing to TAIL</h3>
<p>To process rows from <code>TAIL</code>, we must first declare a cursor object that will be used to indefinitely iterate over rows. To help with our code know when to broadcast an update, we ask for progress markers in the response:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view(self):
    """Spawn a coroutine that sets up a coroutine to process changes from TAIL."""
    async with await self.mzql_connection() as conn:
        async with await conn.cursor() as cursor:
            query = f"DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR TAIL {self.view_name} WITH (PROGRESS)"
            await cursor.execute(query)
            await self.tail_view_inner(cursor)
</code></pre>
<h3>Converting Rows to Batches</h3>
<p>We’ve now created a communication channel which can be used to await results from the tail query. Whenever our view changes, our application will be notified immediately and we can read the rows from our cursor object. <code>tail_view_inner</code> implements the logic to process rows and convert them to batches:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view_inner(self, cursor):
    """Read rows from TAIL, converting them to updates and broadcasting them."""
    inserted = []
    deleted = []
    while True:
        # Block until there are new results (FETCH is not buffered)
        await cursor.execute(f"FETCH ALL cur")

        async for (timestamp, progressed, diff, *columns) in cursor:
            # The progressed column serves as a synchronization primitive indicating that all
            # rows for an update have been read. We should publish this update.
            if progressed:
                self.update(deleted, inserted, timestamp)
                inserted = []
                deleted = []
                continue

            # Simplify our implementation by creating "diff" copies of each row instead
            # of tracking counts per row
            if diff &lt; 0: deleted.extend([columns] * abs(diff)) elif diff &gt; 0:
                inserted.extend([columns] * diff)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Bad data from TAIL: {row}")
</code></pre>
<h3>Updating Internal State and Broadcasting to Listeners</h3>
<p>Now that we have a batch object, we apply this change to our own internal <code>VIEW</code> and broadcast the change to all listeners:</p>
<pre><code>def update(self, deleted, inserted, timestamp):
    """Update our internal view based on this diff."""
    self.current_timestamp = timestamp￼

    # Remove any rows that have been deleted
    for r in deleted:
        self.current_rows.remove(r)

    # And add any rows that have been inserted
    self.current_rows.extend(inserted)

    # If we have listeners configured, broadcast this diff
    if self.listeners:
        payload = {"deleted": deleted, "inserted": inserted, "timestamp": timestamp}
        self.broadcast(payload)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>Design Decision</strong>:<br>
Experienced readers will note that by maintaining an internal copy of the view in our Python web server, we can reduce the number of connections to the materialize instance. This is a strictly optional design decision that I made when writing this code — materialized connections are very light-weight when compared to other databases. We expect that there will be use cases where you will want one or more materialized connection per user. Consider temporary materialized views feeding dashboards personalized to each user, for example.</p>
<p>In the case of this application, I opted to reduce the connections out of habit rather than necessity. It does also enable a larger degree of fan-out, if we wanted to serve millions of clients, for example.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Updating User Views</h3>
<p>Now that we have looked at the code for broadcasting an update, let’s show how our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/main/play/wikirecent/app/src/templates/index.html">JavaScript code</a> consumes these batches. Our application is showing two things: a <em>total edits counter</em> and a <em>top 10 chart</em>:</p>

        <section>
            <article>
                <p>In computer programming, Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm, discovered/invented by <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/index.html">J. Paul Rodker Morrison</a> in the late '60s, that uses a "data processing factory" metaphor for designing and building applications.  FBP defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which communicate via data chunks (called Information Packets) travelling across predefined connections (think "conveyor belts"), where the connections are specified externally to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component-oriented.</p>
                <p>FBP is a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow">dataflow</a> programming characterized by asynchronous, concurrent processes "under the covers", Information Packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, "bounded buffer" connections, and definition of connections external to the components - it has been found to support improved development time and maintainability, reusability, rapid prototyping, simulation, improved performance, and good communication among developers,  maintenance staff, users, systems people, and management - not to mention that FBP naturally takes advantage of multiple cores... without the programmer having to struggle with the intricacies of multitasking!</p>
               <p>FBP exhibits "data coupling", described in the article on coupling as the loosest type of coupling between components. The concept of loose coupling is in turn related to that of service-oriented architectures, and FBP fits a number of the criteria for such an architecture, albeit at a more fine-grained level than most examples of this architecture.</p>
					<p>FBP promotes high-level, functional style of specifications that simplify reasoning about system behavior. An example of this is the distributed data flow model for constructively specifying and analyzing the semantics of distributed multi-party protocols.</p>
                <p><img src="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/bottling_factory.png" alt="Bottling factory" height="400"> </p>
                
                <p>
                    FBP involves a significant "paradigm shift" from conventional programming, as it uses an "assembly line" image of data processing, which really has to be used to experience its advantages.  Not surprisingly given the hold that the so-called "von Neumann" paradigm has over programming technology, over the last 40+ years a number of companies have come out with FBP-like or "FBP-inspired" systems (to borrow a term coined by Joe Witt of Cloudera), which do not involve this paradigm shift, including some of the biggest and most successful companies in the industry, such as IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the New York Times (see <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/links_external.html">FBP External References</a>).  Unfortunately, without the FBP paradigm shift, these systems cannot fully achieve the advantages listed above, although most of them combine a visual notation with some degree of componentry.  We have therefore been forced to use the term "classical FBP" to refer to the FBP architecture described in this web site.  It is hard for someone reading documentation to tell whether a given product calling itself "FBP- like" is "classical" or not,  but, roughly, multiple input ports, "back pressure", and asynchronism, constitute a sort of litmus test to check whether systems should be classed as "classical" FBP systems. While the FBP paradigm shift may cause some trouble at first, given the prevalence of the older programming approaches, in fact it embodies a simple mental model (not "simple" as in easy but "simple" as in elegant, to quote Joe Witt), and has proven over several decades to result in applications that are more understandable and maintainable than those built using the conventional (von Neumann) paradigm.
                </p>
	    <p>If you <i>have</i> come across Flow-Based Programming by way of NoFlo, Flowhub, Node-RED, or similar packages, it is recommended that you read <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/fbp-inspired-vs-real-fbp.html"><i>FBP vs. FBP-inspired Systems</i></a>, which attempts to highlight the differences and similarities between FBP proper, or "classical" FBP, (the subject of this web site) on the one hand, and NoFlo and other similar "FBP-inspired" systems on the other. </p>
                <p>FBP is described in J. Paul Morrison's book, <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/book.html">Flow-Based Programming: A New Approach to Application Development"</a>, now in its 2nd edition, which can be obtained in paperback form from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-2nd-Application-Development/dp/1451542321">Amazon</a>, or in 2 e-book formats: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-J-Paul-Morrison-ebook/dp/B004PLO66O">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/j-paul-morrison/flow-based-programming-2nd-edition/ebook/product-21172063.html">epub</a>.</p>
                <p>Further down on this web page you will find a bunch of useful links, including some videos demonstrating the use of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp/blob/master/README.md">DrawFBP</a>.  During FBP's early days, networks were coded by hand, and initially we used pencil and paper, followed by more sophisticated graphical tools, whether or not they played well with FBP software.  However, with the advent of good graphical support, we now have a powerful graphical tool (<a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp">DrawFBP</a>), and in recent years the emphasis has been shifting to doing the diagramming on-line, and then generating the network code (we can see this progression with other flow tools on the market).  Now that compile and run functions (for Java and C#) have been added to DrawFBP, the developer can do much of the development graphically, and on-line.
                </p>    
                <p>We are in the process of "growing" a <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/fbp-tutorial-filter-file">tutorial</a> which will introduce the reader to the basic concepts of FBP by means of a series of "steps", which use the diagramming tool DrawFBP to progressively expand an application diagram and generate and run code at many of those steps.  </p>            
            <p>There is a Google group on FBP, with almost 800 members, and a Slack channel has recently been set up - here is the invitation link, if you are interested in joining: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/fbphq/shared_invite/enQtOTM4ODkzMTYyODE3LTJiMmNlZjhiMWY1MDY1ODA4Y2YzNDBlNDZlMTBkMDNlMjcwNzg2MGZhZjA2NjJjYTliYTM0OTIyYmM0Yzk0MDQ">Slack invitation</a>.</p>

                <!--<p>We know you are tired of Powerpoint presentations, but <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/FBPnew.ppt">this one</a> (from 2007) gives quite a good overview of FBP - as it was at that time.  There is also a <a href="http://player.vimeo.com/video/79329015">video</a> (not very professional, I'm afraid!), where I present this at a Meetup in Toronto in Sept. 2013 organized by Paul Tarvydas, CEO of Tarvydas-Sanford Controls Inc., and Dann Toliver. It has a few jokes and reminiscences, and may be more accessible than the straight Powerpoint presentation!   The Paul referred to in the video is Paul Tarvydas. Towards the end (at 40:12) there is a brief demo of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="..\graphicsstuff\index.shtml">DrawFBP</a>.</p>-->

                    <p>Even before the World Heath Organization (WHO) assigned Coronavirus pandemic status, people were already coming up with “creative” ways of avoiding infection, some more effective <a href="https://www.gatechecked.com/some-nervous-travelers-are-wearing-water-jugs-to-protect-themselves-against-coronavirus-2440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than others</a>.</p>
<p>Masks and face shields are still selling like hot cakes as hundreds of thousands of cases are recorded daily globally. Some companies have turned to more creative ways of capitalizing on the sudden demand for safety wear. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/biovyzr-venture-out-breathe-easy#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioVYZR</a>, for instance, is developing a consumer grade Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) and plans to introduce it to the market starting at $249. For reference, industrial PAPRs sell for well over $1,500.</p>
<p>For those who may not want to look like they’re suited up for a trip to the International Space Station, another startup company called MicroClimate has also developed their own smaller protective helmet, called the <a href="https://microclimate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AIR by MicroClimate</a>, which honestly looks like something from the dystopian future.</p>

<p>The AIR helmet tries to solve some of the problems faced when wearing masks. For starters, the unit features HEPA-filtered inlets and outlets, and has high-powered fans to keep air moving through the helmet, preventing stale air from collecting and fogging up the glass. According to the website, the battery provides the fans over 4 hours of life, and can be charged via the provided 6 foot long USB-C cable.</p>
<p>The big benefit here is the clear acrylic visor, taking away some of the “annoyances” of wearing traditional masks, like actually being able to see the person’s entire face and not having to struggle understanding what people say through those thicker cloth masks. Finally, the lower section has a washable cushion liner, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods.</p>

<p>With no mention about how sound travels through the device (maybe through the cloth lining at the back), I’m guessing the wearer would have to constantly be on the verge of a shouting match in order to be heard. Even though it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2XF4AsTtuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks relatively easy</a> to take off, I’m sorry for the folks out there who suffer from the regular runny nose.</p>
<p>Opinions about the helmet have been mixed, with some in favor and others out right mocking its design.</p>

January 20, 2021 | https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>You’re a software engineering leader, and you’re great at your job. You know that the optimal path for software development lies in figuring out which components of your design to implement from scratch and which have already been implemented by specialists and can be reused.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>You also know that these aren’t decisions that you can only make once – you have to keep reevaluating based on environment changes and the needs of new products.</p>

<p>Authentication is one of those components that you deal with all the time. Auth is a necessary part of any software product, but how you implement auth is not necessarily always the same. Careful consideration is needed, because your decision to outsource will not only impact speed of development, but also long-term product maintenance – you don’t want to slow down time to market because you re-implemented an entire auth system unnecessarily, but you also don’t want to use an auth system that is going to cause problems down the road.</p>

<p>So what are the primary considerations when making your decision?</p>

<h2 id="speed-to-market">Speed to market</h2>

<p>This is the most obvious consideration. Depending on the features you need, it could literally take months to implement auth in-house, whereas it could take less than a day to incorporate an outsourced solution.</p>

<p>You could say “but what if we only need a bare-bones implementation? Some salted hashes in a database and we’re good to go!” That’s a totally valid point, and if you don’t anticipate needing sophisticated auth features then your best bet might be to do a quick in-house implementation and move on.</p>

<p>However, time and time again I’ve seen product developers underestimate the sophistication of features that will be required when their userbases grow. Most of the time development organizations then fall prey to the sunk costs fallacy and double down on augmenting their in-house solution, even when it may be more efficient to abandon the home-grown effort and replace it with an outsourced solution. This will cause huge issues for maintainability, which I’ll talk about further below.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-breach">Consequences of an auth breach</h2>

<p>Planning for the worst possible case can prevent total financial ruin for your company or division. If a breach of security happens and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is leaked from your in-house auth system, it can not only cause your company reputational damage but also significant financial penalties (not to mention potential jail time if you try to cover up the breach).</p>

<p>If you outsource your auth system you can limit your liability, and also protect your reputation – if there is a breach on your auth provider’s side, it’s likely that the breach will extend beyond your company. A breach in an outsourced auth provider that is used by many different companies will be big news, and customers will be more likely to forgive you for making a mistake in your choice of auth provider than for implementing a poor auth system yourself.</p>

<p>A not-insignificant addendum is that I believe your in-house system is much more likely to suffer a breach than an outsourced provider who is an expert in security. I have no studies to support this claim, but I have never seen a major auth provider compromised, and I’ve definitely seen companies suffer breaches due to their own in-house auth implementations – <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/hacked-and-dumped-online-773-million-records-with-plaintext-passwords/">this article discusses a compilation of 21 million plaintext passwords collected from various breaches</a> wherein passwords were not hashed and salted by auth systems.</p>

<p>Properly storing passwords is an incredibly low bar, and yet companies that manage their own auth still do it incorrectly all the time.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-outage">Consequences of an auth outage</h2>

<p>While less damaging than breaches, outages can still cause reputational damage and liability issues if your SLAs make uptime guarantees. Similarly to breaches, if you outsource your auth system it’s likely that any auth outage will extend beyond your company.</p>

<p>As an example, when Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory (AAD) <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-azure-ad-authentication-outage-what-went-wrong/">went down for a good portion of the afternoon late last year</a>, logins for applications across the internet stopped working.</p>

<p>When your competitors’ authorization systems are down at the same time yours are, nobody blames you for it, but when you’re the only company having issues, you suffer reputationally. No matter what your outsourced auth system is (FusionAuth, Cognito, AAD, etc), you can be almost certain that you won’t be alone in the event of an outage.</p>

<h2 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h2>

<p>There are trade-offs here. The benefits to an in-house system include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your engineers can design the exact system to fit your needs, and you’ll have unrestricted ability to add very specific features if requirements change over time.</li>
  <li>If the same engineers who built the system are maintaining it, then they’ll have the context required to anticipate issues as they add features.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the drawbacks can be large:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex new features can take significant time to build. Outsourced auth systems likely have these features already built (things like multi-factor authentication, user management interfaces, analytics and audit logs, and brute force hack detection, among others).</li>
  <li>With an in-house solution, you’ll have to budget time to monitor new security threats and patch your system in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</li>
  <li>You won’t get the benefits of a dedicated team that are constantly improving your auth system. This is actually a bigger deal than it seems, because if you outsource auth then other companies will also be filing issue reports and feature requests on your behalf, so you reap the benefits of those extra eyes as well.</li>
  <li>In the case of mergers or acquisitions, an in-house solution is likely to be terrible at combining different databases of users and managing things like duplicates or incomplete data. Such enterprise identity unification efforts can founder on internal auth systems. FusionAuth, on the other hand, supports modeling different user bases with tenants.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost-of-in-house-vs-outsourced-auth">Cost of in-house vs outsourced auth</h2>

<p>When building an in-house auth system your costs are all ostensibly sunk (engineer salaries). However, if building your system in-house delays time to market or prevents creation of other features, the build could cost you a significant amount of real income. There will also be on-going maintenance costs with an in-house solution.</p>

<p>When making cost calculations, you should compare:</p>

<p><strong>Revenue lost by slower time-to-market PLUS engineering cost to implement in-house solution PLUS on-going maintenance costs of in-house solution PLUS increased risk of data breach PLUS increased risk of outage PLUS increased risk during a merger or acquisition</strong></p>

<p>vs</p>

<p><strong>The monthly cost incurred by an outsourced provider PLUS the lack of complete control</strong></p>

<p>When evaluating different auth providers, you’ll also want to consider whether an outsourced provider charges on a sliding scale based on number of users or if the cost is fixed. AWS Cognito, for instance, will continue to charge more as your application gains more users. FusionAuth, in contrast, has options that charge a single rate for unlimited users. If your app is small and you don’t expect it to grow much, a sliding scale may be better for you. If you don’t want a large unexpected bill as you gain more users, a provider that allows for fixed costs may be more appealing.</p>



<p>As a final consideration, you may want to evaluate if your engineers even have the ability to implement a secure in-house auth system without a significant investment in education. This is something that many leaders dismiss, since they have great faith in the intelligence and skill of their people.</p>

<p>However, knowledge and intelligence aren’t the same, and just because your engineers are capable of becoming auth experts doesn’t mean you want them to spend the time to do so.</p>

<p>As an engineering leader, you have a responsibility to ensure that your engineers are spending their time on efforts that will optimally contribute to the long-term success of your organization. Auth is a necessary component, but is it really a differentiator for your application?</p>

<p>Only you have the context to make the best decisions for your company, but I hope this article has helped you think through some of the considerations involved in outsourcing your auth.</p>

  <p>Jan 20, 2021</p>




&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<p>I moved this website “worldofmatthew.com” away from CloudFlare back in August 2020.</p>
<p>That should have been the end of the relation with CloudFlare for my website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while I was moving the L7 Anti-DDOS protection to path.net (via a reseller), I checked the SSL Transparency and noticed that CloudFlare still had a <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=3006080109&amp;opt=ocsp">vaild SSL certificate for this website</a>.</p>
<p>Even worse, this CloudFlare certificate lasts for a year, meaning they have a SSL certificate for this website, until June 2021.</p>
<h2 id="irrevocable-ssl-certificates-by-cloudflare">Irrevocable SSL Certificates by CloudFlare</h2>
<p>This website currently uses path.net for DDOS migration. Just like CloudFlare, they have their own SSL certificate for this website. As they require it to MITM website requests to block anyone trying to perform an L7 attack.</p>
<p>The difference is that path.net uses Let’s Encrypt, which would allow me to revoke their SSL certificate for this website. All I would have to do is to download the public key and present that with an Acme challenge and then I can revoke it.</p>
<p><strong>You would think that it would be possible to get a CloudFlare SSL certificate revoked?</strong></p>
<p>How about No?</p>


<center>
<picture>
	<img src="https://worldofmatthew.com/img/2021/01/cfupgrade.png" alt="Cloudflare charging $10 for a web master to have control over SSL.">
</picture>
</center>

<p>Well. Unless you want to pay CloudFlare $10 per month to gain access to the “<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/advanced-certificate-manager">Advanced Certificate Manager</a>”.</p>
<p>This would give access to use a custom Let’s Encrypt. This would also allow you to set your SSL certificate validity period to as low as 14 days, rather than a year on the free “Universal SSL”.</p>
<p>Basically, it is a case of pay CloudFlare $10 per month or they get 100% control over your SSL certificate and will deny your requests to revoke.</p>
<p>In fact, the official stance of the SSL team at CloudFlare is that they won’t revoke unless the team has “<a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/revoke-and-prevent-the-issuing-of-certificates/235478/28">determined the private key was compromised</a>.”</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t this sounding pretty corrupt?</strong></p>
<p>Yes….</p>
<p>You blindly trust that CloudFlare will delete the SSL certificate upon leaving. They will provide you zero evidence of them of actually deleting the certificate.</p>
<p>This is from a CDN who has a level of access unmatched by their rivals. CloudFlare are becoming the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/02/25/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/">defualt DNS for browsers</a> and have a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">VPN service</a>.</p>
<p>You have to trust them to never abuse that power.</p>
<p>Even worse, as they forcibly keep a working SSL certificate, they don’t even have to generate a new one. Meaning, SSL transparency <strong>WILL NOT</strong> show anything if CloudFlare ever decide to hijack and MITM traffic to your website.</p>
<p>If someone asks that a SSL certificate is revoked after leaving it, revoke it. The webmaster is no longer giving them permission to have a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>By not allowing for SSL certificates to be revoked, CloudFlare is in effect holding them hostage. It must not be the job of a Certificate authority to refuse such requests.</p>
<p>Most Certificate authorities would never lock a webmaster out of control of a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>They also would not tell people to pay of $10/month for get rights to revoke a Certificate.</p>
<p>This comes to a question of whether CloudFlare should even be in SSL chain-of-trust.</p>
<p>I requested for them to revoke, by not revoking Cloudflare are keeping an active SSL Certificate without my permission. I think such behavior should make browsers question if they can keep Cloudflare in their chain-of-trust.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>For the last two years, Mala Jadwani, a 31-year-old teacher, has received daily messages from her 60-year-old <em>chachi</em>. On their family WhatsApp group, her aunt, who started using a smartphone a few years ago, posts classic older-relative content: garden-variety motivational quotes, prayer emojis, home remedies for body aches, and “good morning,” “good afternoon,” and “good evening” greetings accompanied by pictures of babies and roses. On days when her chachi’s messages were particularly prolific, Jadwani’s phone would freeze, forcing her to disable WhatsApp’s automatic photo download setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But last week, her chachi’s<em> </em>WhatsApp messages suddenly stopped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worried, Jadwani called her aunt. It turned out that she had read a chain of viral messages on WhatsApp, which falsely said the platform’s messaging system was no longer private. She was one of millions of users who received a push notification from WhatsApp earlier this month, explaining that the company was updating its privacy policy, mostly in superficial ways. After February 8, 2021, “you’ll need to accept these changes to continue using WhatsApp,” <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/whatsapp_new_privacy_policy_facebook-news-47077.php">the update read</a>. The thought of her WhatsApp messages being exposed frightened Jadwani’s aunt so much, she said, that she stopped sending messages on WhatsApp altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India is WhatsApp’s largest consumer market by many measures, but backlash against the recent privacy policy change is now threatening its future in the country. Many people have debated the update with their friends and family, and it’s also been featured in nightly news shows and on the front page of local newspapers. Last week, Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, took <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90593913/whatsapp-facebook-privacy-outrage-newspaper-ads">out full-page advertisements</a> and plugged interviews <a href="https://twitter.com/digbijaymishra1/status/1349562056429641735?s=20">with the heads of WhatsApp</a> in newspapers, in an effort to mitigate the fallout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The change isn’t actually a departure from how WhatsApp has treated user data for years. The platform has shared metadata — phone numbers, how often the app is opened, and operating system information —&nbsp;with Facebook since <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/whatsapp-privacy-facebook/">2016</a>. The pop-up notification millions of users received on January 8 sought explicit permission to continue these existing practices. But unlike four years ago, “there was no opt-out option to refuse sharing information with Facebook companies,” said Apar Gupta, executive director of the nonprofit Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF).</p>



<p>The new changes are related to how businesses communicate with WhatsApp users. The update made it clearer that commercial activity on the messaging platform has the potential to spill over into other Facebook apps: “a handbag you browse on WhatsApp could pop up later in your Instagram app,” as <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/whatsapp-data.html">explained</a>. Over <a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660772483104769?s=20">175 million</a> people already message companies on WhatsApp, and the updated terms of service would make it “easier to chat with businesses who may use Facebook business products,” <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/about-new-business-features-and-whatsapps-privacy-policy-update">reads a blog post</a> from WhatsApp’s communications team. The post claims that the update would enable customer service features like purchase receipts.</p>



<p>The confusing change triggered a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/signals-downloads-skyrocketed-4200-after-whatsapp-announced-it-would-force-users-to-share-personal-data-with-facebook/articleshow/80232029.cms">mass exodus</a> of WhatsApp users, who moved to other messaging platforms like Signal and <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/terror-on-telegram/">Telegram</a>. After the disastrous rollout, Facebook later announced it was delaying updating its privacy policy by three months, but for loyal WhatsApp users, the damage has already been done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook’s privacy practices and <a href="https://thewire.in/business/facebook-is-misleading-indians-with-its-full-page-ads-about-free-basics">policy decisions</a> in India have long been criticized. What’s different this time are the demographics of the people who are outraged: uncles and aunties. For the first time, India’s most loyal and engaged users are questioning the intentions of an app that has grown to encompass nearly every aspect of their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WhatsApp groups are an indispensable part of South Asian families: they’re a forum for gossip, dodgy forwarded messages, boisterous political debates, and generally the primary way for relatives to stay in touch. Many of these WhatsApp family groups — including my own — erupted with anger and confusion in the days after the platform sent the pop-up message announcing its new policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sheshadri Narayanane, a friend from high school, is a part of two family groups. He said his 70-year-old aunt falsely believed WhatsApp had been granted access to her bank accounts. <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/whatsapp-pay-enters-india/">WhatsApp recently launched payments</a> in India, allowing users to send and receive money by connecting their bank accounts to the messaging app. The privacy update came shortly after WhatsApp Pay was launched, which might have caused some of the confusion. “Bad timing is my theory,” Narayanane speculated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On prime-time talk shows, news hosts likened the update to <em>digital dadagiri</em>, or “digital bullying,” by WhatsApp. “They want to sell your chats — your data from WhatsApp private chats — to business enterprises,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0F5T1Q0z5Y">declared</a> one news anchor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The debates often took on a political tone. Some TV hosts asked questions about the government’s ability to protect India’s sovereignty. Gaurav Bhatia, the national spokesperson of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">weighed in</a>, saying his party would go to any lengths necessary to protect the privacy of its citizens. On January 19, the Ministry of Electronics and Communication Technology (MeitY) sent a request to Facebook to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/govt-tells-whatsapp-to-respect-privacy-of-indians-withdraw-new-policy/articleshow/80344964.cms?from=mdr">withdraw the new changes made to its privacy policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why is it that these social media giants, who need the India market, are having two different policies for different countries?” Bhatia said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">nightly news show,</a> referencing the fact that WhatsApp’s policy update <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/why-whatsapp-s-privacy-rules-sparked-moves-to-rivals-quicktake">does not apply to the European Union</a>. Some accused WhatsApp of treating Indians as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18of5M6g2M&amp;t=1625s">second-rate citizens</a>.” Local technology entrepreneurs who compete with Big Tech companies like Facebook soon <a href="https://twitter.com/vijayshekhar/status/1349186007007023104?s=20">piled on</a>.</p>



<p>Facebook has repeatedly emphasized that WhatsApp can’t see the content of end-to-end encrypted messages, which can be viewed by only the sender and receiver. Alternatives like <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2021/01/11/whatsapp-telegram-signal-privacy-security-comparison/">Telegram don’t necessarily offer</a> the same protections as WhatsApp. Digital liberties activists and advocacy groups like IFF <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152?s=20">recommend</a> using Signal instead for sensitive communications, and the app quickly became the number one downloaded app in India earlier this month. Signal commemorated its victory on Twitter. “Look at what you’ve done,” read a <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1347693761044701186?s=20">tweet</a> from the app’s official account, accompanied by an emoji of the Indian flag.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though users are downloading Signal and other encrypted alternatives in high numbers, switching might not be as simple for aunties and uncles who spent years becoming proficient in using WhatsApp. Vivek K, a 28-year-old tech entrepreneur, tried making the case to his mother that she should switch over to Signal and was met with an unenthusiastic response: “She said, ‘Now, you’re making me learn one more app? I can’t do it; I’m too old for this<em>,</em>’” explained Vivek.</p>



<p>For now, with the privacy update postponed until at least May, WhatsApp is working to mitigate the backlash. But people like Jadwani’s chachi are still staying away from the messaging app. Jadwani said she hasn’t missed the lack of daily greetings. “No wonder my phone hasn’t had issues,” she said with a laugh.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><blockquote><p>This is an in-depth review of how Synyx GmbH &amp; Co building is using Turing Pi board in combination with GitLab CI and Ansible for their CI/CD needs</p><cite>Author: Karl-Ludwig Reinhard</cite></blockquote></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In my previous&nbsp;article,&nbsp;I explained some cloudy statements about Ansible and Gitlab CI and that we’re going to work with a Turing Pi for that purpose. I already talked about the capabilities of this amazing board and the first steps it takes to get it up and running. Today I’ll go a little bit into details on what benefits we are having when running Ansible scripts in a CI environment and most important where the Turing Pi helps us.</p><h3>What we’re going to build with it?</h3><p>In our project, we have a lot of Raspis and configure them all with Ansible. From time to time we are adding new features and fixing bugs in our Ansible scripts and that makes them more complex. We are using GitLab to review our code, but what is missing is a validation of the syntax and that the code will actually work on production’s hardware. Considering that our team continues to grow, this adds more complexity. So we put 4 Raspberry Pis into a rack and integrated them as a deploy target for our merge requests.</p><h4>When a user opens a merge request, we reboot the machine and run the OS via the network. With that, we can flash the SD card with a fresh Raspbian. After a reboot, we can start our Ansible scripts to test if the merge request is sane.</h4><figure><img src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>With just running an Ansible Playbook for setting up hosts from 0 to 100 we get the following benefits:</p><ol><li>Check if the syntax is correct</li><li>Ensure that all needed files are committed</li><li>Can different configuration flavors still be applied?</li></ol><h2>Why do we need netboot at all?</h2><p>Our goal is to run our Ansible script against a freshly installed Raspbian. We cannot be sure, that the last tested merge request was flawless. The idea is to reboot the node into an NFS based root file system. From there we can flash a Raspbian and reboot into a clean OS. After that, we can apply &amp; test our Ansible scripts. Following this process guarantees, that every merge request gets a clean system without any leftovers from a previous run.</p><h2>Setting up Gitlab CI/runner</h2><p>To be honest&nbsp; – we’re currently stuck with a shell runner. We weren’t able to find a proper working docker image with ansible that doesn’t lack some tooling/libs that are currently required. Building a custom docker image would be possible but for the sake of simplicity, we use a simple shell runner.</p><p>First of all, we need to set up one node as a DHCP/TFTP boot server. Here is a good <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tutorial</a> on how to do this. We recommend to run one of the Turing Pi nodes as a DHCP/TFTP boot server – it’s more reliable than a server placed outside of the board.</p><p>One thing to note: The DHCP server is located behind a NAT router so it does not interfere with DHCP servers in our company network.</p><p>When the server is up and running, we need to set up the Gitlab runner.</p><ol><li>Due to the fact we rely on a shell runner Ansible has to be installed by hand. This can be done with your package manger. Also, install all dependencies that are needed for a successful Ansible run.</li><li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Install</a> GitLab CI runner. When asked which kind of runner, choose shell runner.</li><li>Add a custom inventory.<br>You can use your regular inventory and add there your ci host. Then you have to limit your Ansible run with <code><mark>–limit</mark></code> option. If omitted you’ll most probably deploy your prod system with every merge request 🙂</li><li>Add or change <code><mark>.gitlab-ci.yml</mark></code> accordingly:</li></ol><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">stages:
  - test-on-pis
  
test-on-turing-pi:
  stage: test-on-pis 
  script:
    - export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
    - mkdir $HOME/.ssh || true 
    - echo -e "Host 192.168.2.*\nStrictHostKeyChecking no\nUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" &gt; $HOME/.ssh/config

    - ansible-playbook site.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=Bai9iZaetheeSee5" -e "http_proxy="
  except:
    - master</pre><p>We do some „dirty“ SSH tricks at the beginning. This ensures that Ansible can connect to the systems even when the host keys have changed. That will happen with our setup after we reflashed the system. We tried to do this during an ansible run but weren’t successful.</p><p>Reflashing your Pi is really straightforward when the PXE server is setup. Let’s have a look at some excerpt:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">--

  when: root_mnt.stdout_lines[0] != "nfs"

    delay: 60
    timeout: 120
  connection: local</pre><ul><li>• First of all, we check if the current system is already running on an NFS root filesystem. If so we can skip the next two steps. If not we destroy the current boot partition – just write some rubbish on the raw device.</li><li>• Next, we reboot the system.</li><li>• Then we flash the sd card/eMMC with the help of Zcat. We compress our images to save some HD space and be able to transfer them via a wan connection(if needed). The performance impact is negligible. One reboot later and that’s it. We have a freshly installed Raspbian and can apply our Ansible scripts to a fresh system.</li></ul><h3>Two things to note:</h3><ul><li>• We ignore errors when flashing. When the image is missing or similar, we just continue and reboot the system. In most cases, the system will be still accessible</li><li>• I couldn’t get the reboot module working properly. I think the newly flashed system does not have the same remote user and password as when we started the role. With this ugly part, it’s working 🙂</li></ul><p>Be aware that the above script is an excerpt from the main.yml of the corresponding role and is not complete!</p><h3>What we also do</h3><p>After a successful run, we apply some smoke tests. One flavor of our RPis is kiosk systems that start X11 and opens a chromium browser in fullscreen mode. With some „technical creativity“(aka mocking) we ensure that the browser is running. When this is not going to happen, the build fails. Another flavor is used for controlling an industrial actor and its basic functionality is also tested at the end. We do not test every aspect, it’s more of a kind of smoke tests or checks if certain TCP ports are open.</p><p>What we also want to know how our Ansible scripts affect a running system that is not flattened or rebooted on every run. We deploy two node continuously when a merge to master happens. With that, we can also monitor the memory usage on these systems and can identify possible memory leaks or stability issues when running a system longer time. It has served us well as an additional safety net.</p><h2>Why the Turing Pi is ideal for us</h2><p>Compared to our old setup we gained speed and stability of our builds. In the past, we had problems when booting multiple pis in parallel from the network. PIs were stuck in the boot process and didn’t get their kernel via TFTP or couldn’t mount the NFS root reliably. To this day, I’m not sure where I went wrong – I fixed it by throttling the reboots so that the Pis are booted one by one. That slowed down the „build“ significantly.</p><h4>With the Turing Pi we did not encounter any problems booting pis in parallel from the network at the same time. So after testing it a bit I removed the throttle and reduced the build time significantly</h4><p>Another thing we see a lot less stuck Ansible jobs because the network connection is flaky. I got the impression, that working with the network on the PCB is a lot more reliant. We use Turing Pi for two weeks as a replacement for our old „test cluster“ – can’t remember that I had to reset the cluster manually caused by a frozen job.</p><p>Currently, we work most of the time from home –&nbsp; Covid19 case numbers are rising in Germany and it looks like we’ll stay at home for some time. With some VPN and network magic, we can use some nodes as test devices from the remote. In the past, everybody got his „personal“ test pi, had to ensure proper network connection, flash the sd card manually, etc. Yes, you can use Raspbian X86 but some things like accessing Bluetooth or GPIOs cannot properly be tested in a virtual environment.</p><h2>What we’ve learned as a team?</h2><p>In our last review and retro, we talked also about our CI setup. We’ve agreed, that it helps us a lot in our day-to-day business and adds to the quality of our merge requests. For me personally, it is a very good incentive to use more merge requests so the CI pipeline is triggered and I am forced to work more in a clean way. But it takes time to set it up, stabilize some (ugly) parts – but after all the time investment is worth it. Additional tests and reviews improve the quality even in the context of configuring an OS and reduces the number of errors.</p><h2>What we miss with Turing Pi</h2><p>Not much to be honest. Two things would be really awesome:</p><ol><li>Switching the HDMI output from the first node to a different node via i2c</li><li>For flashing EMMc the first slot only can be used. It would be great if you could also use the other slots for flashing as well.</li></ol><p>I think achieving these two points isn’t easy and for us not really pain points 🙂</p><h2>Where we (maybe) want to go</h2><p>Currently, we are deploying our prod systems still from our workstations. Continuos delivery will be a topic for us. But something like „merge on master“ and deploy the prod system instantly is too risky for us. Our Pis are an integral part of our customers. And that’s not the definition for CD(for me :)). Our pis are not easily …</p></div></div>

    <p>I know a number of folks use <strong>The Great Suspender</strong> to automatically suspend
inactive browser tabs in Chrome. Apparently recent versions of this extension
have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleTaylor/comments/jowlt2/open_source_development_the_great_suspender_saga/">taken over by a shady anonymous entity</a> and is now
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/great-suspender-extension-now-flagged-malware-edge-has-built-replacement">flagged by Microsoft as malware</a>. Notably the most recent
version of the extension (v7.1.8) has added integrated analytics that can
track all of your browsing activity across all sites. Yikes.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for users of The Great Suspender (7.1.8):</strong></p>

<h3>Temporary easy fix</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable analytics tracking by opening the extension options for
The Great Suspender and checking the box
“Automatic deactivation of any kind of tracking”.</li>
<li>Pray that the shady developer doesn’t issue a malicious update to The Great Suspender later.
(There’s no sensible way to disable updates of an individual extension.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Permanent harder fix <small>(👈 <strong>Recommended!</strong>)</small></h3>

<ul>
<li>Close as many unneeded tabs as you can.</li>
<li>Unsuspend all remaining tabs. ⏳</li>
<li>Uninstall The Great Suspender.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.1.6">latest good version</a> of The Great Suspender (7.1.6) from GitHub,
and move it to some permanent location outside your Downloads folder.
(It should be commit 9730c09.)</li>
<li>Load your downloaded copy as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-you-can-still-download-chrome-extensions-without-us-1826796797">an unpacked extension</a>.
(This copy will not auto-update to future untrusted versions of the extension.)</li>
<li>All done! 🎉</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> My understanding is that installing an unpacked extension in this way
will cause Chrome to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25847171">issue a new kind of security prompt</a> every time it is
launched, which you’ll have to ignore. 😕</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>Other browser extensions for suspending tabs exist, as mentioned in the
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25846504">Hacker New discussion</a> for this article. However I have not conducted my own
security review on any of those other extensions, so buyer beware.</p>

      <article role="main">
        <p>In October, the popular and famous archivist tool <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a> was taken down by GitHub due to a DMCA request by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America#Criticism">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. I posted a <a href="https://assassinate-you.net/posts/2020/10/youtube-dl-takedown/">detailed analysis</a> explaining the relation between international, US, EU and German law, and showing why this request was very different from what most people know as the “classic” DMCA takedown request. I felt this was necessary since there were a lot of rumor and wrong claims out on the Internet (not just in forums or on the (anti)social media, but also on media offerings), which did not help the discussion at all. The repository is back now, thanks to the EFF and its team. They <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca">filed a counter-notice</a> on behalf of the youtube-dl maintainers, which allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository.</p>
<h2 id="eff-helps-out-by-writing-a-counter-notice">EFF helps out by writing a counter notice</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, a non-governmental organization based in the U.S. dedicated to defending civil liberties and especially digital rights, helped out the youtube-dl maintainers by filing a very informative <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">counter notice</a> with GitHub. This notice explained why the request itself is an abuse of the DMCA and the takedown was not justified at all. It allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository and, more importantly, all the metadata (for example, issues and pull requests) that was posted on the platform by users, developers and maintainers. Such information is invaluable to a project, and a takedown of the <em>entire</em> repository with all this data can hurt a project very badly.</p>
<p>The takedown was widely regarded as abuse of the DMCA by the RIAA, given that the youtube-dl code repository did not contain any infringing material. The argumentation was made up by claiming that the primary purpose was to infringe copyright of some songs whose artists are apparently represented by the RIAA. They cited some automated unit tests for this, which do not download the entire songs, and would not be seen or executed by regular users. The EFF argues that these are likely a form of “fair use” and thus allowed legally.</p>
<p>The request also cited an obscure German court decision which considered YouTube’s “rolling cipher” an “effective technological measure”, whose bypassing would be prohibited by copyright laws around the world. The EFF explains that the decision was “wrongly decided and is not binding nor even persuasive under U.S. law”.</p>
<p>The EFF further questions the effectivity of the algorithm in general, given that YouTube delivers the code for decryption in a readable form (and also, the code can be executed outside browsers, too). On top of that, the streams are freely accessible once you have the URLs. YouTube only hides the URLs, but not in an effective way. Therefore, this algorithm cannot be considered a “technological measure”, and thus, the RIAA request is baseless.</p>
<p>In the context of this debate, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS">DeCSS controversy</a> was mentioned a lot, as there’s been some similarities with how copyright holders reacted to the existence of software to bypass their (arguably not very secure) CSS protection. Their first actions focused on software hosting sites, pressurizing them to take down the software by threatening them with legal steps. This led to a mirroring campaign, due to what we call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> nowadays.
There’s been some litigation in the early 2000s, where judges ruled in favor of the copyright holders.
However, this has little relevance to the case of youtube-dl, as the EFF explains. Reverse-engineering YouTube’s code doesn’t enable users to save copies of the material, they already can do so in many other ways. Also, youtube-dl doesn’t bypass DRM technologies like Google’s Widevine. Also, there’s many resources under free licenses on the video platform, which users are explicitly allowed to download and share. And in the U.S., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress">Library of Congress</a> may even <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2018/10/new-exemptions-dmca-section-1201-are-welcome-dont-go-far-enough">issue exemptions of Section 1201</a> of the DMCA, under which bypassing anti-circumvention is fine legally.</p>
<p>EFF’s notice summarizes the situation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, youtube-dl does not violate either the Copyright Act or the DMCA. EFF  and  the  youtube-dl  maintainers  thank  GitHub  for  standing  up  for  the  rights  of developers whose projects it hosts. We hope this explanation will allow you to restore the youtube-dl repository so that GitHub can continue to be the home for development of this popular and important tool.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">EFF letter to GitHub on youtube-dl takedown</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, EFF! You did not just helped a tool that is crucial to journalists, activists, lawyers and so many other people. You also destroyed the RIAA’s wrong claims, which will hopefully prevent similar attacks on other tools in the future.</p>
<h2 id="githubs-reactions">GitHub’s reactions</h2>
<p>Regarding GitHub, it is sad that they took down the repository at all. It’s a well-known pattern: platforms rather comply with such requests than risking litigation, requiring projects to invest time and money to fund lawyers themselves (or hope for an association such as the EFF to pick up their case). The moment they published the request and took down the repositories, many experts immediately raised concerns that the request itself is illegal. It remains questionable why GitHub’s legal team didn’t recognize this. They likely were not prepared well enough for such a situation. GitHub did not stand up for the community that made them the most popular hosting platform for software in the world.</p>
<p>Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, later apparently reached out to the youtube-dl team personally, expressing his sympathy, and offering some support. However, the damage was already done then. The team lost its primary communication channel to their users and each other, as well as the entire history.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that their PR department recognized they are criticised heavily for taking down the project in the first place, putting their (actually pretty good) relation to the open-source community at risk, and thus creating a serious threat to their business.</p>
<p>At least this case prompted them to rethink their strategy on future lawsuits. They posted a <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">blog article</a>, excusing their takedown with compliance, as expected. They promised changes for the benefit of projects threatened by similar requests in the future at least, such as donating to a “developer defense fund” dedicated to helping out projects threatened by such anti-circumvention takedown requests.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they recognized that there is a strong need for maintainers to access the issues and pull requests. They promised to ensure that developers can export those after a takedown (even if requests are valid). The real question however is why they wouldn’t just keep showing them, and just hide the code repository. Introducing such an option globally for every repository would be an even bigger improvement, allowing developers to always create backups of those data.</p>
<p>As GitHub state themselves, among all DMCA takedown requests, these circumvention ones are quite rare. We will have to see whether it is going to have a lot of effect. It would be better if they just donated money to defend developers of projects for which they receive <em>any</em> kind of unwarranted takedown request, rather than limiting it to this edge case.</p>
<p>By the way: in the end, it’s up to the people to request better copyright laws from the politics. They tend to get worse, not better. Make sure your voice is heard. Call your representatives (that’s better than sending a mail, as a phone call can hardly be ignored). Go on the streets and protest against changes and for improvements <em>for you as a user</em>. Support campaigns of civil rights organizations trying to change the laws.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Maintainers who host their projects on large proprietary platforms like GitHub or GitLab’s cloud offering should always have a strategy for such situations. They should set up mirrors of the code proactively. Backing up metadata is significantly harder (especially if platforms don’t provide import/export tools, which most of the big ones do not). Some people use the project import features in tools like <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a>, but as those are one-off features, one would have to repeat the process every now and then. For the issues, there is an experimental tool called <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug">git-bug</a>, which allows offline backups and migrations, and comes with bridges to import and export to a variety of tools (and is <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug#help-needed">looking for contributors</a> to add new bridges and extend the functionality).</p>
<p>It looks like the free software community should prepare themselves better in the future. We should develop better tools to back up our metadata, also allowing us to move between platforms more easily.
If GitHub wants to remain the most popular hosting platform, they should consider adding such functionality out of the box (ideally in a standardized format). Offering such functionality doesn’t mean that projects would just leave for other platforms automatically. It would rather show that GitHub is really committed to the idea of open-source software, whose development can take place everywhere. After all, we are the ones who helped GitHub become the number one platform for software development in the world.</p>
<p>There is one thing that has been and is always going to be counterproductive, especially in such situations: blind actionism. Many people flooded the Internet (read: forums, Reddit, bug trackers of projects), inciting panic and suggesting to move to some other “free” hosted platform. This is clearly not a solution. Any hosting platform will sooner or later have to comply with such a request. It can become very expensive if you end up in court. The true solution, as we have seen in this situation, is to stay calm, analyze the situation, assess the threat to your own project and remove code and text that could be abused to justify such a request (e.g., if you are developing a similar project and also use such songs in a unit test, you can change your test to content under free licenses). Moving to another platform does not solve the root issue, and …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

Our Windows team was the frontrunner on this effort to the point where about 70% of 1Password 7 for Windows is written in Rust. We also ported the 1Password Brain – the engine that powers our browser filling logic – from Go to Rust at the end of 2019 so that we could take advantage of the speed and performance of deploying Rust to WebAssembly in our browser extension.</p><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p><h3 id="did-any-of-rust%E2%80%99s-advantages-like-speed-or-type%2Fmemory-safety-influence-the-choice-of-using-rust-for-1password%3F">Did any of Rust’s advantages like speed or type/memory-safety influence the choice of using Rust for 1Password?</h3><p>One of the main things that drew us to Rust initially was the memory safety; it definitely excites us knowing that Rust helps us maximize our confidence in the safety of our customers’ secrets. Beyond memory safety, though, there’s so much more we love about the Rust ecosystem. There is a significant performance benefit to the lack of a traditional runtime; we don’t have to worry about the overhead of a garbage collector, for instance. Rust offers a form of “program correctness” and many guarantees against undefined behaviour at runtime. The strong type system enforces these rules at compile-time. Carefully aligning application logic with Rust’s strong type rules makes APIs difficult to use incorrectly and results in simpler code that’s free from runtime checking of constraints and invariants; the compiler can guarantee there are no invalid runtime code paths that will lead your program astray before it executes. Having to perform less runtime state validation leads to cleaner, more efficient, more focused, and higher quality code. Rust requires very little runtime debugging compared to other languages. If it compiles, you can be fairly sure it won’t exhibit unexpected behaviour. It may not be what you <em>want</em> but it will be “correct”. 🙂</p><p>Another very powerful (and often overlooked) feature of Rust is its procedural macro system, which has allowed us to write a tool that automatically shares types defined in Rust with our client-side languages (Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript). The output from this tool handles the serialization/deserialization process automatically, meaning our client-side devs can continue to work in their language of choice while interacting with the Rust library and can be free from the concerns of JSON parsing over the foreign function interface (FFI). We get all of this while enjoying the benefits of compile-time type checking in every one of our target languages. We’ve integrated this tool into our continuous integration server as well, meaning that changes to the Rust models can result in compilation failures in the client applications that are caught during our review process.</p><p>This tool has been an integral component in our development process, allowing us to move much more quickly than ever before. Once our types are defined in Rust, we are able to immediately generate equivalent types in our client-side languages. This allows our devs to focus on solving problems without having to hand-roll boilerplate code to communicate over the FFI.</p><h3 id="how-good-is-rust%E2%80%99s-support-(library-and-otherwise)-for-developing-security-centric-applications-like-1password%3F">How good is Rust’s support (library and otherwise) for developing security-centric applications like 1Password?</h3><p>There is more than enough to build a majority of the base that security-centered applications require. There are two large, prominent cryptography platforms (<em><a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">ring</a></em> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">Rust Crypto</a> group) that together provide a wealth of functionality. As I mentioned above, writing with Rust itself gives you much greater confidence in your memory usage and makes it much harder to accidentally introduce a memory-related exploit into your application. There is also a wonderful system in place for keeping track of vulnerabilities that do show up from time to time in Rust crates: the <a href="https://rustsec.org/">RustSec</a> database, which is community-sourced by other Rust developers and is updated frequently with new information that can be consumed in CI audit scans. The batteries-included test framework that Rust and Cargo also include mean that you always have an easy way to write unit-test suites for correct behavior in critical code, like any cryptographic functions that you write.</p><p>While safe native Rust libraries for everything are the dream (and they will come in time), there is always the option to dip down and easily consume something in C or from native platform libraries. We use this to great effect in our Rust code for things like calling out to the native implementations of biometric unlock (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) and platform-specific settings implementations like NSUserDefaults on Apple platforms.</p><h3 id="any-particular-rust-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Any particular Rust libraries that you want to feature?</h3><p>Absolutely. Tokio, Hyper/Reqwest, Ring, and Neon all have a home in 1Password and are fundamental in allowing us to tackle this ambitious project at all. You should also check out our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/password-rules-parser">password-rules-parser</a> on <a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, which is based on a spec primarily being backed by Apple. Their tools and docs can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/">here</a>.</p><h3 id="where-is-rust-great-to-use%2C-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Rust great to use, and where does it fall short in your stack?</h3><p>Rust has fulfilled 90% of what we were hoping for when we started this project. We’ve been able to deploy it to nearly every one of our target platforms in some way shape or form (with the exception of Apple Watch). The language itself has been designed with modern sensibilities and is improving with every release. It has great documentation and an active community.</p><p>Although there are countless crates available for use, we did have to roll our own logging and tracing tools to ensure that they were safe to use in 1Password. Additionally, we constructed a substantial localization implementation to meet the requirements of our products.</p><p>It did fall short for us in one key area: We were hoping WebAssembly would take us further in the browser and our browser extension than it has. WebAssembly has been great as a function library, but attempting to stand up an entire runtime in WASM has been a challenge. Many of the issues we ran into, however, were not limitations of Rust but of WebAssembly as a deployment platform.</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-1password-with-rust%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing 1Password with Rust?</h3><p>Many of the folks on our team were new to Rust, and they experienced the typical learning curve that comes with its memory management and ownership model. We are also finding the compile times to be pretty beefy; our CPUs and fans are definitely getting a workout. 😄</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Absolutely.</p><p>If you’re new to Rust, start small and build on top of that. We ran a large number of experiments when we were getting started to try and find the edges of what a Rust-based solution could provide. When your experiments pan out, try to reimagine the ways you used to work with other languages and see if your code can benefit from Rust’s philosophy.</p><p>If you’re new to 1Password, you can <a href="https://start.1password.com/sign-up/plan?c=1PCORE2021">sign up today with this link</a> and save 50% off your first year for family and individual accounts.

      <h3 id="soul-a-new-language-now-in-v10-makes-audio-coding-vastly-more-accessible">SOUL, a new language now in V1.0, makes audio coding vastly more accessible</h3>

<h5 id="january-20-2021">January 20, 2021</h5>

<p>London — Today’s release of SOUL, the new universal language for audio applications, will dramatically lower barriers and expand access for developers creating any apps that depend on audio, as well as providing a more efficient architecture for audio processing.</p>

<p>SOUL has reached version 1.0 status with its language, compiler, and “SOUL patch” format all stable, tested, and ready to use in a wide variety of audio-related projects.. The team, led by JUCE and Tracktion creator Julian Storer, is already at work on an array of other SOUL tools including a visual editor and a developer portal.</p>

<p>“SOUL will revolutionize audio app development, eliminating challenges that have impeded developers for too long,” said Julian Storer, Head of Software Architecture at ROLI. “The need for a radical rethink of how audio apps are made has only become more urgent since I started the SOUL project in 2016. I’m tremendously excited about the V1.0 released today and the additional tools to come.”</p>

<p>Both a programming language and a platform for creating audio plugins and apps, SOUL will solve four fundamental problems facing audio developers today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easy to learn and use: C++, the standard language for audio app coding, is extremely difficult to learn. The SOUL language is much simpler and more intuitive. Browser-based tools and fast live testing make it even easier to use and master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More secure: Sandboxing untrusted third-party code adds performance overheads that are a particular problem for audio coding. SOUL uses an intermediate assembly language called HEART that is safe to run without sandboxing, making SOUL code far more secure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimized for power and performance: CPU-intensive power consumption is a constant problem for developers. The SOUL language is far more efficient. It is specifically designed for performance, with its JIT engine matching an equivalent program written in native C++.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Achieves lowest latency: Latency in audio apps is another deep-rooted issue that to date is solved by running audio on dedicated audio hardware. SOUL unlocks ultra-low latency on devices without the need for embedded CPUs and DSPs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since debuting SOUL at ADC 2018, the team has continuously welcomed feedback through the open-source repository at https://soul.dev. This feedback has helped SOUL reach its V1.0 state today.</p>

<p>The SOUL team encourages developers to explore the language on soul.dev, read the documentation on the SOUL repository on Github, and give more feedback as the SOUL toolset continues to grow this year.</p>

  <section>
    <p>One of the advantages of QWidgets when building a Qt application is
the ability to build in a simple way custom widgets with the QPainter
API. This gives the Qt developer almost total freedom to implement
complex geometries for their widgets.</p>
<p>On the other hands, QML contains by default only rectangles. These
rectangles can change the radius to create circles and rounded rectangles, but more
complex shapes are more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-custom-geometry-in-qtquick">The current state of custom geometry in QtQuick</h2>
<p>Fortunally, the Qt API provides multiple ways to implement custom shapes,
that depending on the needs might be enough.</p>
<p>There is the Canvas API using the same API as the <code>canvas</code> API on the web but
in QML. It’s easy to use but very slow and I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
<p>Instead of the Canvas API, from the QML side, there is the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-shapes-shape.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QtQuick Shapes module</a>.
This module allows creating more complex shapes directly from the QML
with a straightforward declarative API. In many cases, this is good enough
for the application developer but this module doesn’t offer a public C++
API.</p>
<p>If you need more controls, using C++ will be required to implement custom
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickitem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickItem</a>. Unfortunately drawing
on the GPU using QQuickItem is more
complex than the QPainter API. You can’t just use commands like <code>drawRect</code>,
but will need to convert all your shapes in triangles first. This involves
a lot of maths like it can be seen in the example from the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-scenegraph-customgeometry-example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official documentation</a> or from
<a href="https://www.kdab.com/efficient-custom-shapes-in-qt-quick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the KDAB tutorial (Efficient custom shapes in Qt Quick)</a>.</p>
<p>A QPainer way is also available with <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickpainteditem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickPaintedItem</a>,
but it is slow because it renders your shape in a textured rectangle in the
Scene Graph.</p>
<h2 id="the-rusty-way">The Rusty way</h2>
<p>What if we could transform arbitrary shapes into triangles? We would get a
high level API but still get great performance. This process is called tessellation
and there are a few libraries that implement it. For example in C++, we
have Skia and CGAL. Unfortunatelly, both aren’t easy to use, so I decided to look
at the Rust library ecosystem and in particular at <a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyon</a>,
which was designed with performance and compliance to the SVG standard in mind
since the goal is to use it in Servo in the future.</p>
<p>Lyon doesn’t have any C++ bindings but I got inspired by the recent
<a href="https://jbbgameich.github.io/misc/2020/12/21/rust-in-a-kde-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post from Jonah</a>
and I need to say the experience of writing bindings was a breeze.</p>
<p>The first step was creating wrapper <code>struct</code>s around the
Lyon primitives. <code>LyonPoint</code>, <code>LyonGeometry</code> and <code>LyonBuilder</code> will
later be directly usable from the C++ side.</p>

    <p>
      SymQEMU: Compilation-based symbolic execution for binaries
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the Network and Distributed System Symposium (NDSS 2021),
    San Diego, CA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software analysis and bug
      detection. Compilation-based symbolic execution is a recently proposed
      flavor that has been shown to improve the performance of symbolic
      execution significantly when source code is available. We demonstrate a
      novel technique to enable compilation-based symbolic execution of binaries
      (i.e., without the need for source code). Our system, SymQEMU, builds on
      top of QEMU, modifying the intermediate representation of the target
      program before translating it to the host architecture. This enables
      SymQEMU to compile symbolic-execution capabilities into binaries and reap
      the associated performance benefits while maintaining architecture
      independence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We present our approach and implementation, and we show that it
      outperforms the state-of-the-art binary symbolic executors S2E and QSYM
      with statistical significance; on some benchmarks, it even achieves better
      performance than the source-based SymCC. Moreover, our tool has found a
      previously unknown vulnerability in the well-tested libarchive library,
      demonstrating its utility in testing real-world software.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is a fast symbolic execution engine for binaries. On this page, we
    provide its source code, the raw results of the experiments described in the
    paper, and instructions how you can replicate those experiments yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symqemu">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe three sets of experiments: we first benchmark
    SymQEMU with Google FuzzBench, then we run it on real-world software, and
    finally we perform a benchmark comparison during concolic execution of fixed
    paths. This section describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides
    links to our results.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        FuzzBench (see the <a href="http://s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/2020-05-24-symqemu.zip">report</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We will share our integration scripts shortly; they're being cleaned up
        to obtain SymQEMU and its dependencies from the new public repository.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        For the analysis of real-world software we used the same setup as in the
        <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/symcc.html">evaluation of SymCC</a>. The binaries for SymQEMU,
        QSYM and S2E were plain builds without any instrumentation. SymQEMU was
        run via SymCC's fuzzing helper by prefixing the target command
        with <tt>/path/to/symqemu-x86_64</tt>. For the S2E analysis, we created
        a default project, then enabled the <tt>FunctionModels</tt> plugin and
        activated the option <tt>generateOnStateFork</tt> in
        the <tt>TestCaseGenerator</tt> plugin; coverage was evaluated
        with <tt>afl-showmap</tt> at the end of the analysis, using the same
        AFL-instrumented binaries as with the hybrid fuzzers.

<div id="introduction">
<h2><a href="#id8">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Back in 2018, we compared empirically the performance overheads of Go
and C++ with regards to the low-level calling convention: to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">pass
arguments</a>,
to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">return multiple values</a>, and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">when propagating exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>Those results were obtained with Go 1.10 and Clang 6.0. Since then,
compilers have evolved and we are now running with Go 1.15 and Clang
11.0. Have the findings changed since&nbsp;then?</p>
<p>The question of interest&nbsp;was:</p>
<blockquote>
What is cheaper: handling exceptions via <code>panic</code> / <code>recover</code>, or
passing and testing error results with <code>if err := <span>...;</span> err != nil {
return err }</code>?</blockquote>
<p>In fact, as we will see below, the conclusions are stronger today than
they were two years&nbsp;ago.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology">
<h2><a href="#id9">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>The reader is first invited to familiarize themselves with the
discussion of Go’s low-level calling convention as compared with C++’s
in the previous chapters of this series: <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64.html">as of 2018</a> and <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64-2020.html">as of 2020</a>. The 2018
analysis is still largely valid in 2020—the C++ calling convention did
not change, and Go introduced a few optimizations on the
implementation of <code>defer</code>.</p>
<p>There were three analyses&nbsp;previously:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to measure argument passing and returning multiple values, we will
use exactly the same methodology as the previous two analyses <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>These analyses contain their benchmark source code, which is also
provided at <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2018-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a>. The
derivation of plots was entirely automated via <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>,
which we can thus&nbsp;re-run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>for the <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">third analysis</a>,
which measures and compares the cost of error returns with that of
throwing and catching exceptions, we are going to reuse the same
methodology, but a diffence source code for the benchmark. The new
source code has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2020-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a> as
well. This difference is motivated&nbsp;below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also use an upgraded benchmark system, configured as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CPU</span>: <span>AMD</span> Ryzen 7 3950X 3700.07MHz Family=0x17 Model=0x71&nbsp;Stepping=0</li>
<li><span>OS</span>: FreeBSD 13.0-<span>CURRENT</span>&nbsp;r366805</li>
<li>go version 1.15.5&nbsp;freebsd/amd64</li>
<li>C++ FreeBSD clang version 11.0.0&nbsp;(llvmorg-11.0.0-0-g176249bd673)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="experimental-results">
<h2><a href="#id10">Experimental&nbsp;results</a></h2>
<p>All the generated data files and Jupyter notebooks <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/notebook.zip">can be downloaded
here</a>.</p>
<div id="findings-for-argument-passing-and-returning-multiple-values">
<h3><a href="#id11">Findings for argument passing and returning multiple&nbsp;values</a></h3>
<p>Here the findings are largely unchanged from 2018: for the selected
benchmark code, the code generation by our selected compilers has not
changed&nbsp;significantly.</p>
<p>Only the new hardware <span>CPU</span> influences the measurements: the new <span>CPU</span> has
a higher clock frequency than previously, so for an equivalent
mix of instructions we expect and observe a 10-40% raw performance
improvement. Additionally, the Ryzen 7 3950X architecture has a
somewhat more powerful superscalar execution unit than the 1800X, and
is able to detect inter-instruction dependencies across more memory
accesses. This causes more measurements artifacts when the workload is
extremely small, and erases the performance differences between 1 and
5 function arguments or return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>The main conclusions thus remain&nbsp;unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go uses memory to pass function arguments and return values. This
makes Go code perform about twice slower than equivalent C++ code on
function calls, where C++ compilers use register-based calling
conventions&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>The particular <span>CPU</span> we used this year uses a micro-architecture able
to more aggressively optimize memory-heavy code, and so the Go
performance overhead relative to C++ is erased for very small
functions; unfortunately, these optimizations become ineffective with
more realistic, wider function&nbsp;bodies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Go, memory is used for return values even when there is just one
or two words worth of data. In these cases, a C++ compiler also
typically uses registers. This choice in the Go compiler is
unfortunate, as it mandates copying the return values through memory
at every call level when functions return each other’s value in a
cascade. This cost thus multiplies the overhead of the memory-based
return by the call depth, in a way that does not occur, or much
less, with a typical C++ code&nbsp;generator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As previously, we can discuss what is the proportion of function
calls relative to other types of code. Arguably, in
computation-heavy algorithms, functions often get inlined so that calls
disappear. In that case, it is possible for the Go compiler,
assisted by the <span>CPU</span> micro-architecture, to reach similar instruction
throughputs as the equivalent C++&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>However, we can also point out that Go still promotes the use of
dynamic dispatch (via interface methods) as an idiomatic approach to
software design. For example, string composition via
<code>bytes.Buffer</code> interfaces with the <code>fmt</code> packages using
interface calls (<code>io.Writer</code>), and the proportion of
cross-interface calls is relatively high in that case compared to
the computation&nbsp;load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reader is invited to review the more detailed summaries from the
previous analyses, where the situation is presented in more&nbsp;detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="measuring-errors-vs-panics-reminder-and-code-tweak">
<h3><a href="#id12">Measuring errors vs panics: reminder and code&nbsp;tweak</a></h3>
<p>This analysis calls for a benchmark which performs a “unit of work” in
a loop, with the size of the loop configurable as&nbsp;“workload”.</p>
<p>We are modeling the extremely common case where any error inside a
unit of work aborts the entire workload: the error may or may not be
generated inside the unit of work, but needs only be detected once for
the entire outer workload&nbsp;loop.</p>
<p>In Go, we originally used the following code as&nbsp;benchmark:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this code, <code>leafErr</code> represents the “unit of work”, where errors
can originate. The <code>workErr</code> represents the main work computation,
where <code>leafErr</code> is called&nbsp;repeatedly.</p>
<p>(The <code>go:noinline</code> annotation is explained in more detail in the previous&nbsp;analysis.)</p>
<p>In the case where the <code>error</code> return is used, we need to check the
<code>err</code> return on every iteration of the loop. If we used exception
instead, we could factor the exception check out of the&nbsp;loop:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Exception check factored out of the loop:</span>
  <span>defer</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>recover</span><span>();</span> <span>r</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}()</span>
  <span>// Main workload follows:</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>errObj</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(The accompanying C++ code is implemented similarly, using
<code><span>std::tuple</span></code> for error returns and <code>try/catch/throw</code> for&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>Just looking at the shape of the source code, we can already suspect
the findings that follow: there is less work inside the workload loop
when using exceptions. So as the workload increases, the cost of
setting up the “catch” logic gets&nbsp;amortized.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is exactly what was observed in 2018. (<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html#summary-and-conclusions">Summary and
conclusions
here.</a>)</p>
<p>However, when running the same experiment in 2020 on our new test
machine, with Go 1.15, the measurements are all over the place, the
results appear chaotic, and the difference we observed last time is
nearly entirely erased. What&nbsp;happened?</p>
<p>It turns out that the new <span>CPU</span> used to run the benchmark really has a
much better micro-architecture. It is able to peek through the call
from the <code>work</code> function to the <code>leaf</code> function, analyze
inter-instruction dependencies across the call, and fully pipeline the
processing of the <code>leaf</code> function across multiple iterations of the
<code>work</code> loop. This effectively invalidates the model we used: in a
realistic application, there is enough complexity in the code inside
the “workload”, when it contains function calls, that the <span>CPU</span> cannot
pipeline loop&nbsp;iterations.</p>
<p>To restore a valid model, we should thus tweak the benchmark program
by adding just enough additional complexity in the “unit of
work”. Here, we achieve that by adding just one extra level of
intermediate&nbsp;call:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>intermediateErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(Likewise for the benchmark using&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>This program, at least on the <span>CPU</span> considered, is “complex” enough to
stop the superscalar unit from peeking across the function call. The
resulting code then behaves regularly in&nbsp;measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="findings-for-error-returns-vs-exceptions">
<h3><a href="#id13">Findings for error returns vs&nbsp;exceptions</a></h3>
<p>The Jupiter notebook for this experiment contains the data processing steps
and the logic to generate comparison plots, with some detailed analysis
of the intermediate&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>The key result is the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/err-comparison.png"></p><p>What we see&nbsp;here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For an equivalent workload (e.g. 1000 “units of work”), the Go code
is 40% slower than the equivalent C++ code. This is generally
expected as Go is much more memory-heavy than&nbsp;C++.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regardless of the language considered, the cost of setting up an
exception “catch” can be reliably amortized across an entire
workload: the performance of code using exception-based error
reporting asymptotically converges to become the same as code using
no error handling&nbsp;whatsoever.</p>
<p>In comparison, code that propagates errors as return values is
systematically slower as the workload increases; between 1-3% for
C++, up to 4-10% for&nbsp;Go.</p>
<p>This is one of the two main&nbsp;results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The cost of setting up an exception “catch” is not entirely
negligible. Back in 2018, the mandatory fixed cost of the <code>defer</code>
setup and testing <code>recover()</code> in the <code>work</code> function was 50ns;
such that it took about 500 nanoseconds worth of “workload” to fully
offset this one-time&nbsp;cost.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>
  <span>systemd</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale-autoconnect</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>

    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet.

A <a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2018/03/an-eleventh-century-chinese-coin.html">previous post</a> discussed a find of a Northern Song dynasty Chinese coin from England whose context suggested that it may have been a genuine ancient loss from the medieval period, along with a variety of textual and archaeological evidence for contact between England and East Asia in the Middle Ages. The following post returns briefly to this question, noting the recent discovery of a second Northern Song dynasty coin from England.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--3nBO7B5Iko/X-MjGm2QgBI/AAAAAAADOLE/kpvCKTVJ84Iwh3lK_qblI19FdkxzYk7fwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1200/HAMPC2BC79.jpg"><img data-original-height="571" data-original-width="1200" height="238" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--3nBO7B5Iko/X-MjGm2QgBI/AAAAAAADOLE/kpvCKTVJ84Iwh3lK_qblI19FdkxzYk7fwCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h190/HAMPC2BC79.jpg" width="500"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A copper-alloy Chinese coin of the Northern Song emperor Zhenzong, dated 1008–16, found near Petersfield, Hampshire (image: <a href="https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/924566">PAS</a>).</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p>The coin in question was issued between<i>&nbsp;</i>1008 and 1016 during the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Zhenzong">Emperor Zhenzong</a> of the Northern Song dynasty and was found at Buriton, Hampshire, around 9 miles from the coast. As was the case with the other eleventh-century Chinese coin discussed here <a href="https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/924566">previously</a>, the coin doesn't seem to be part of a 'suspicious' grouping of finds or deposited curated collection, and the field that it was recovered from has also produced a handful of medieval- and immediately post-medieval finds. These include a coin of King John minted at London in 1205–7, a medieval cut farthing of perhaps 1180–1247, two fragments of one or more medieval or early post-medieval vessels, and two mid-sixteenth-century coins. As such, it seems credible that this coin too could have been a medieval-era loss, and in this context it is worth noting that such Northern Song coins might quite credibly have arrived at any point up to perhaps the late fourteenth century, given that they continued to circulate in significant numbers well into that era.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Looking more generally, the fact that we now have two, rather than one, eleventh-century Northern Song dynasty coins from England, both recovered from what seem to be medieval to early modern sites, adds weight to the case for considering them genuinely ancient losses. Interestingly, this find was also made only around 20 miles away from the only confirmed medieval imported Chinese pottery from England, a sherd of blue-and-white porcelain from a small cup or bowl that was found in a late fourteenth-century context at Lower Brook Street, Winchester. As to the wider context for these coins, the evidence for the presence of people who had, or who may have, travelled from East Asia in England during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was surveyed in the <a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2018/03/an-eleventh-century-chinese-coin.html">previous post</a>, as was the evidence for people from Britain and Ireland in East Asia then. However, it is worth additionally drawing attention here to the 'global' distribution of medieval Chinese pottery and coins west of India, as mapped below, which demonstrates that finds of Chinese pottery and, to a lesser extent, coins outside of East Asia are by no means unknown.</p><p>With regard to the medieval Chinese pottery finds mapped below, substantial quantities have now been&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.openedition.org/afriques/1836">recognised</a>&nbsp;from around the Indian Ocean coast and in both the Persian Gulf and Red Sea areas into northern Egypt. Archaeological finds of Chinese porcelain&nbsp;<a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol16/16_063_078.pdf">from Europe</a>&nbsp;are much rarer, although definite examples are known from Winchester, Lucera (Italy) and Budapest (Hungary), along with a handful of surviving intact items that are believed to have entered Europe in the medieval era. The most famous of these are the so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317076925_A_Chinese_Porcelain_Jar_Associated_with_Marco_Polo_A_Discussion_from_an_Archaeological_Perspective">'Marco Polo jar'</a>, a thirteenth- or fourteenth-century Chinese Qingbai porcelain jar found in the&nbsp;Treasury of San Marco in Venice, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Collections-Research/Collection/Resilience/Artefact/Sponge/54194ae6-5acb-43c1-b2e8-e7c13feb508c">Gaignères-Fonthill vase</a>, an early fourteenth-century Chinese Qingbai&nbsp;porcelain vase that was&nbsp;<a href="https://jekely.blogspot.com/2010/12/note-on-fonthill-vase.html">almost certainly</a>&nbsp;present in Naples in the fifteenth century. In addition to these, there are a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol16/16_063_078.pdf">documentary references</a>&nbsp;to Chinese pottery from medieval Europe. So, the 1323 will of&nbsp;Queen Maria of Naples and Sicily is believed to mention Chinese pottery, as does a 1363 inventory of property belonging to the Duke of Normandy and a 1379–80 inventory of Louis I, duke of Anjou. It also appears in, for example, a document from late fourteenth-century Genoa listing merchandise including porcelain, lustre ware and glass, and a 1456 inventory of the property of&nbsp;Piero di Cosimo de' Medici of Florence. As such, it seems clear that Chinese pottery was present in the households of the wealthiest people in Europe during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Turning to the medieval Chinese coins mapped below, these are recorded much less frequently as archaeological finds and do not appear in documents from Europe at all, although this latter is hardly surprising. The only other certain find from Europe is a find of a tenth-century coin from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/37163357/%D0%9B_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D1%8F%D0%B4%D1%8A%D0%BA_%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%80_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%BE%D1%82_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE_%D0%A2%D1%8A%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE_Early_Medieval_chinese_bronze_coin_from_Veliko_Tarnovo_district_%D1%81%D0%BF_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9C%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B8_%D0%AE%D0%BB%D0%B8_%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B8_2017%D0%B3_%D0%A1%D1%84_2018%D0%B3_%D0%B1%D1%80_1_2_%D1%81_41_42">Bulgaria</a>, although a scattering are also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/5985193/J_Cribb_and_D_Potts_Chinese_coin_finds_from_Arabia_and_the_Arabian_Gulf_in_Arabian_Archaeology_and_Epigraphy_1996_no_7_pp_108_118">recorded</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/2566792/Northern_Song_coin_finds_in_Harla_Ethiopia_point_to_newly_found_silk_routes_from_China_to_the_Horn_of_Africa">East</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/5999530/Identification_of_a_Chinese_coin_found_in_Kuumbi_Cave_Zanzibar_by_prof_Felix_Chami">Africa</a>, the Persian Gulf, the coast of Arabia, India, and Sri Lanka, suggesting that it is not impossible that a handful of examples might have made their way to Red Sea or Persian Gulf ports and then into Europe.</p><p><b>The content of this post and page, including any original illustrations, is Copyright © Caitlin R.

  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>. Last updated on January 20, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Comirnaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment. I include links to online shops below, but note that they sell “for research use only” and will verify your affiliation with a research organization before taking your business.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation">electroporation</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides and polymerase, and in some cases special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>A method to protect the mRNA from degradation either co- or post-transcriptionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore.</p>

<p>To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added. To do so while the mRNA is transcribed (co-transcriptionally) a 5’ cap analogue is added to the reaction mixture and incorporated by the polymerase when it reads a specific initiator sequence. There is only one vendor for this analogue; <a href="https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cleancap-reagent-ag-3-ome.html">TriLink</a> and its partner <a href="https://www.tebu-bio.com/">tebu-bio</a> for the European market. Post-transcriptionally it can be done using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE).<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with these COVID vaccines.) The co-transcriptional method is generally more suitable for industrial processes as there is no need for an additional post-purification and it is faster since it works in one step. In their July 2020 investor update BioNTech refers to usings TriLinks trinucleotide cap and hence this is likely part of the production method of the approved vaccine.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Ultimately, the cap analogue or the VCE can drive cost and present bottlenecks if production is not increased accordingly.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message either by encoding it in the DNA template or using a Poly(A)Polymerase. Both <a href="https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics">BioNTech</a> and Moderna are using the faster and convenient DNA template approach.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is a key component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA

<h3 id="creators-of-the-hippocratic-license-establish-a-nonprofit-to-empower-developers-to-use-their-technology-talents-for-social-good-and-to-prevent-harm">Creators of the Hippocratic License establish a nonprofit to empower developers to use their technology talents for social good and to prevent harm</h3>

<p>Geneva, Switzerland, January 19, 2021 – The creator of the <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev/">Hippocratic License</a>, an ethical license for open source, and <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>, the first and most popular code of conduct for open source projects, today announced the establishment of a new nonprofit, the Organization for Ethical Source (OES).</p>

<p>Central to the philosophy of open source is the notion of software freedom, referred to as “Freedom Zero”: that open source software can be used for any purpose without restriction, <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#evil">even for explicitly “evil” purposes</a>. The world has changed since the Open Source Definition was created — open source has become ubiquitous, and is now being leveraged by bad actors for mass surveillance, racist policing, and other human rights abuses all over the world. The OES believes that the open source community must evolve to address the magnitude and complexity of today’s social, political and technological challenges.</p>

<p>Inspired by the work of Latinx and Chicanx activist organization <a href="https://twitter.com/conmijente">Mijente</a> and their #NoTechForICE campaign, the Ethical Source Movement <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/blog/ethical-source-six-month-retrospective/">launched in October 2019</a>. Its first milestone was the March 2020 release of the Hippocratic License 2.1, an ethical open source license tied to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and developed in collaboration with a pro-bono legal team from partner organization <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab</a>. The license has already been adopted by hundreds of open source projects including the Ruby library <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr/">VCR</a>, mobile app development tool <a href="https://github.com/vinivendra/Gryphon">Gryphon</a>, Javascript mapping library <a href="https://react-leaflet.js.org/">react-leaflet</a>, and the entire open source portfolio of the <a href="https://ideas.bywetransfer.com/story/ethical-source-at-wetransfer">WeTransfer</a> corporation. But the most significant impact of the license may be the <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/ethical-source-hippocratic-license">debate it sparked</a> between ethical-minded developers and open source traditionalists around the primacy of “Freedom Zero.”</p>

<p>“For too long we’ve been comforting ourselves with the myth that technology is inherently neutral. But there is nothing neutral about police using facial recognition algorithms to target legitimate protestors, or algorithms that perpetuate bias and sexism and racism, or any other of the dozens of kinds of human rights abuses we see technology playing a part in today,” said Coraline Ada Ehmke, president and founder of the Organization for Ethical Source. “As technologists we have to accept that our work has an outsized impact on society, and that means we have an outsized responsibility to minimize the harm it can cause. The Organization for Ethical Source was founded to help technologists accept these responsibilities, and learn how to center justice and equity in the work we do. We are united in our conviction that software freedom must not come before human freedom.”</p>

<p>With a founding grant from the <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network</a>, the Organization for Ethical Source is developing new programs that build on its initial work with the Hippocratic License — extending the reach of that effort while developing new tools and projects focusing on ethical governance, digital supply chain compliance, and other strategies. The organization’s leadership team includes founding members Coraline Ada Ehmke, Don Goodman-Wilson, and Tobie Langel. Elections for the Governing Committee are slated to take place in February 2021.</p>

<p>“There are so many ways that communities can come together today to tackle the tech industry’s biggest problems, and that is especially true about the open source community,” said Aniyia L. Williams, Principal, Responsible Technology, Omidyar Network. “We are excited to see the formation of the Organization for Ethical Source, and are thrilled to power the innovative, thoughtful, and courageous plans they have for creating accountability in building software.”</p>

<p>“Systemic change in the tech industry is long overdue, and the Organization for Ethical Source is a much-needed catalyst,” said Charity Ryerson, Executive Director of Corporate Accountability Lab. CAL is a nonprofit organization providing legal support to the new organization through developing ethical license offerings and providing free direct legal services to ethical license adopters. “We are excited to support this initiative, and hope to see tangible improvements for cobalt miners, Foxconn workers, immigrant detainees and others who have been harmed by Big Tech.”</p>

<p>The Organization for Ethical Source brings together open source maintainers and contributors, tech ethicists and advocates, licensing experts, human rights workers, academics, and more to strategize about ways to incorporate ethics into open source work. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">Learn more about the Organization for Ethical Source</a>, or <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/apply">apply to join</a>.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-organization-for-ethical-source">About the Organization for Ethical Source</h3>

<p>The movement to promote ethics and social responsibility in open source was founded in October 2019 by Coraline Ada Ehmke, and led to the establishment of the nonprofit Organization for Ethical Source under Swiss law in December 2020. The organization is dedicated to giving technologists tools and resources to ensure that their work is being used for social good and to minimize harm. It develops tools to promote fair, ethical, and pro-social outcomes for those who contribute to, or are affected by, open source technologies. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">https://ethicalsource.dev/</a></p>

<p>It was downloading a virtual private network that ultimately convinced Joe that he wanted to be a programmer. On the other side of China’s firewall three years ago, he stumbled across American journalist Steven Levy’s book <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, which describes hackers not as malicious actors but people who saw the potential of the internet to benefit all — visionaries who understood early on the revolutionary possibility of computers. This idea, that programming could be chaotic and creative, resonated with Joe while he explored the internet beyond the reach of China’s censors.</p>



<p>“I found myself attracted by the idea of open source and hacker culture, and interested in the challenging part of programming,” said Joe, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. He learned to program by joining free web development classes online and looking at existing code on the Microsoft-owned GitHub, the world’s largest open source code repository. Today, he is a software engineer in Shanghai.</p>



<p>Open source code has been <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/">essential</a> for the rapid growth of China’s tech sector. At Chinese tech companies, programmers like Joe have at their disposal foundational building blocks of code freely available on GitHub. This allows them to make their own rather than starting from scratch every time, meaning they can iterate and scale fast. With their code hosted in public for all to see, companies benefit from programmers around the world raking it over for errors; programmers learn from each other’s experiments and mistakes in real time. But while open source code has helped bolster China’s tech scene, the idea behind it — borderless exchange of information — contrasts with Beijing’s controlled approach to managing the internet.</p>



<p>Uncertainty hangs over GitHub’s future in China. Many fear that the site could be banned by China’s internet censors for hosting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-github-free-speech-covid-information/">a workers’ protest</a> or <a href="https://qz.com/1846277/china-arrests-users-behind-github-coronavirus-memories-page/">information about the coronavirus</a>. Developers have raised concerns that American regulators could pull the plug over the company’s business with Chinese firms, though <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/culture/article/3029385/github-says-chinese-developers-are-safe-export-restrictions">GitHub has said</a> the open source code itself is exempt from these export controls.</p>



<p>Amid the tensions, Beijing has embraced open source in the development of emerging technologies, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G. The goal is not only to position China on the global cutting edge of high-tech development but for Chinese companies to rely solely on homegrown talent and supply chains. In recent months, the Chinese government has championed domestic alternatives to widely used international open source institutions, particularly Gitee, a <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">direct parallel to GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But adopting open source technologies means embracing transparency, standardization, and a borderless philosophy — one that may sit uncomfortably with China’s push for technological self-reliance. “Basically, you cannot nationalize open source,” said Julian Sun, Beijing-based senior research director at tech industry analysis firm Gartner. “It’s already global.”</p>

<p>Rooted in the pioneering days of the early internet, the open source movement is founded on the concepts of iteration and reciprocal transparency. If one company’s developer wants to build a particular function into its software, they can go to a code repository like GitHub and see how others have solved the same problem. The more eyes there are on the code, the better it is; companies that make their code public benefit from developers combing it over, catching bugs, and submitting suggested fixes. GitHub has grown into the largest code repository in the world, with more than 40 million users and 206 million code repositories. Even the software behind <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/">F-16 fighter jets</a> runs on open source technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China is home to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">fastest-growing number</a> of GitHub users outside of the U.S. Through the site, programmers in China don’t just learn new code — they are exposed to what they describe as the “open source way of thinking,” based on a philosophy of free exchange of ideas and information, without government interference or regulation. Despite the discordance of these principles with China’s approach to controlling the internet, code hosted on GitHub has been essential for the country’s tech sector. If it is blocked, developers know they need an alternative.</p>



<p>Developers’ concern the code hosted on GitHub could be a casualty of the escalating tensions with the U.S. was among the reasons for the Chinese government’s move to promote homegrown platforms, said Yik Chan Chin, a computer scientist and associate professor of communications at Beijing Normal University. “The technical community started to reflect on what the strategy is to protect information technology companies in the future. People started to worry. … What will happen to all the open source software and apps stored in that platform?”</p>



<p>In July, one of China’s top tech policymaking bodies, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, joined Huawei, Tencent, and a handful of top universities in a high-tech consortium <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">endorsing Gitee</a> as the official hub for China’s open source community. Shortly after, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and other tech companies announced <a href="https://www.openatom.org/#/projectList">the launch</a> of the OpenAtom Foundation, China’s answer to The Linux Foundation, a long-standing pillar of the international open-source community.</p>



<p>The foundation’s flagship project is Huawei’s mobile operating system, HarmonyOS, intended to rival the dominance of Android and Apple’s operating systems, with the code hosted on Gitee.</p>



<p>Huawei has previously relied on Google’s Android operating system, but the Chinese company’s inclusion on the Entity List has meant that Google can no longer support the partnership. Android is not only the most widely used mobile operating system in China, it’s also the basis for China’s varied, inventive, and well-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17988564/chinese-phone-software-android-iphone-copy-ui">app ecosystem</a>. The odds of success for HarmonyOS hinge on whether Huawei can encourage developers to build apps for the platform.</p>



<p>There are an estimated 780 million smartphone users in China, and Huawei accounts for <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-share/">more than 40%</a> of the smartphone market in the country. Huawei has said it’s aiming to get HarmonyOS onto <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3117573/huawei-aims-deploy-harmony-os-400-million-devices-2021-going-beyond">400 million</a> devices this year, including smartphones, wearables, and TVs. It could create an enormous market for developers to make products for Harmony in China alone. Developers have criticized the company for not yet releasing enough information to determine how truly independent the operating system is.</p>

<p>“Gitee’s future depends on attracting quality open source projects onto its platform, from both in and outside of China, which in turn attracts developers from both China and elsewhere to collaborate and contribute,” Kevin Xu, venture investor and founder of newsletter <a href="https://interconnected.blog/">Interconnected</a>, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>“It takes years to build that kind of network effect among developers that GitHub has currently,” said Xu over email. “It’s impossible to know what will be the catalyst for Gitee. Having a central government ministry’s support does not help in either attracting top-tier projects or developers from inside and outside of China; it only helps with getting business from highly regulated or government customers.”</p>



<p>Gitee does have advantages over GitHub, which requires a baseline level of English to use. Many programmers in China either access the U.S. site through mirrors or through Chinese-language blogs, which can be outdated. GitHub’s leadership has expressed interest in opening a dedicated China operation, and authorities have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b">reportedly encouraged</a> the company to expand, but that has yet to materialize. A more widely used Chinese-language environment could allow more programmers to join in on open source coding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Beijing’s push for a vibrant open source ecosystem based in China could be hamstrung by its own, long-standing objections to the environment that birthed the movement — the free and open exchange of information. The controlled internet behind the Great Firewall is not as rich with information as the unfettered web beyond it.</p>



<p>“There are differences in how people access knowledge in China versus how people access this information outside of China,” said Joe. “Because of the Great Firewall, there are huge quality differences between the knowledge and information you can get from Google and Wikipedia [vs] Baidu.”</p>

		<p>Real time, text communications are not the invention of email. In the 1960’s and 1970’s, long distance was expensive and fax very slow. Vulcan needed an alternate method to communicate in real time for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The two offices needed written communications on production schedules and preparation of quotations. For example, the factory was required to send a periodic telex to inform the executive office of the status of every back order in the system.</li>
<li>Since a third of Vulcan’s sales volume was international, it needed to communicate rapidly with its customers, both during the sales process and to respond rapidly during breakdowns.</li>
<li>Its field service force needed a way to obtain quick answers, especially when in places like Southeast Asia where the time difference made voice telephone difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>Telex was the obvious answer. A more general description of the technology and its history is given below; here we will concentrate on Vulcan’s use of telex as a business tool.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://vulcanhammer.info/32asr/" data-orig-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif" data-orig-size="213,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="32asr" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=213" data-large-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=213" src="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=1040" alt="32asr">During the years the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/vulcan-florida-executive-office/">Australian Avenue office</a> was in operation, both that office and the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/vulcans-chattanooga-factory/">Chattanooga facility</a> possessed telex machines similar to the one shown on the right. These were basically electromechanical terminals using roll paper printed on by a cylindrical drum with the letters on it (typewriters with a ball printer used the same idea, but the results looked better.) On the left was the paper tape punch. For most telexes, one composed them recording the telex on the paper tape, which encoded the data with a system of punched holes, similar to a player piano roll. When the telex was sent, once the connection was made, the paper tape was played back to the receiving telex. In this way the message would not be hindered by slow typing with mistakes. It was also possible to leave the tape punch on to record receiving telexes as well for retransmission. (<em>A fictional enactment of using the telex–and the possible result–is found in the novel <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/633941">The Ten Weeks</a>.</em>)&nbsp; A telex machine similar to Vulcan’s is shown in action below.</p>

<p>Telex could also be used in a “dialogue” mode similar to instant messaging or IRC chat, but Vulcan seldom used it in this way. With this, the initiator of the dialogue could ring the bell at the recipient’s end to get their attention.</p>

All of the telexes here went to Belgium, so they were probably for the Vulcan’s business associate in Vilvorde, Nilens. Since they were around Christmastime, somebody hopefully put in a “Joyeux Noel” somewhere in there.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Telexes were identified by the telex number and the answerback. In the example above, when Straits Engineers sent the “Who are you?” our machine responded with its answerback, VULCAN WPB. The sending machine then replied with its own before going into the message, generally adding its telex number as well. Thus, “STREL RS” was the sender’s answerback and “23644” was the telex number. (The “RS” identified the telex as from Singapore; this is the <a title="direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rfc1394.pdf">direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier</a>. The answerback is the key feature; it verifies to the sender that the recipient is actually receiving what’s sent. Once the recipient’s number is dialled, the cross (<a href="https://www.vulcanhammer.org/what-is-the-gospel/">the usual sign of getting access</a>) appeared with the “who are you?” request. If connected, the recipient’s answerback came up. This enabled telexes to have legal standing.</p>
<p>A little figuring for inflation with the bill shown, however, will show that the messages, generally not very long, were rather expensive. This led to a lot of people using abbreviations in telexes (such as “u” for “you”, very similar to what you see in text messaging today.) Vulcan’s people never quite got the hang of this. Still, telexes were received in real time, or at least greeted their recipients when they arrived the next morning, which is more than “snail mail” could do then or now.</p>
<p>Telex machines were virtually universal with Vulcan’s international business associates. One Vulcan agent boasted of his own status by informing us that he had his own machine, while some of his competitors used “the public telex!”</p>
<p>One of the more intensive uses of telex took place in 1981 with the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/a-fistful-of-yuan-vulcan-in-china-1981-3/">negotiations and sale of the 560 package to the Petroleum Corporation of the People’s Republic of China</a>. The Chinese were as detailed in their demands of quotation presentation as they were in those for technical information. After a day of negotiations, we composed and sent a telex with our requests back to the U.S., where the day was just started. The next morning we would have our reply and resumed our negotiations. (Telephone calls in and out of China at that time were very difficult, and with a long list of spare parts and prices, would not have done the job.)</p>
<p>After that Vulcan replaced its telex machine (the Florida office was closed) with a newer model, with a dot matrix printer (still on a roll) and a screen terminal for composition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless throughout the 1980’s Vulcan’s use of the telex was in decline for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The collapse of the oil industry in the early 1980’s shrunk Vulcan’s international business considerably.</li>
<li>Vulcan obtained CCITT Group 4 faxes in the mid 1980’s, as did its customers. Combined with new economies in long distance service (domestic and international,) fax proved a more practical way to communicate with its customers, both within and outside of the U.S.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the early 1990’s telex was pretty much a thing of the past at Vulcan. In 1995, Vulcan obtained its first email address, and the cycle of sending text electronically started all over again. But telex had paved the way.</p>

Donald E. Kimberlin 1996</h4>
<p><a title="(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/haynes-notes.pdf">(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)</a></p>
<p>Telex certainly should be called the original form of E-Mail. Far from “dead” on a global basis, UN reports published in the “Britannica Book of the Year” indicate there are about three million Telex lines around the globe. Contrary to the impression international telephone people like to create, direct, immediate access via Telex still exists to more of the world’s political entities than does telephone. This has been the case for many years. (Totalitarian governments must like Telex; they have been known to shut down telephone service, but not Telex. The suspected reason: It can be monitored with hard copy easily, and has often been done, too. Of course, they themselves use it for military messages.)</p>
<p>Telex sprang from the same source as the Volkswagon automobile: The creative growth era of the early Third Reich. It was devised as a means to distribute military command and control messages and data in a time before we even had a structure for data processing machinery. What existed at that point in time was 45.5 bps Baudot automatic telegraphy and dial-pulsing telephone exchanges. The original Telex was essentially (director-controlled; yes, the Europeans were doing that then) rotary telephone switches modified to carry DC telegraph lines, providing a switched service for teletypewriters in the same way as was done for telephones.</p>
<p>There was one major difference: Intercity transmission facilities were expensive and in short supply, and one analog telephone circuit between cities could carry 24 (and in some applications, 25) telegraph channels bearing Telex. The economics are obvious, and probably are what keep Telex important in the Third World today.</p>
<p>In that era of transparent analog transmission lines, Telex was easily able to use telephone dial-pulsing on the local telegraph loops followed by Baudot teletype for the messages … and it did. Hence, this form of Telex operation became known as “type A Telex signaling.” It is still used that way in many nations. In those you will see a teleprinter with a control box that has a telephone dial. When Western Union decided it had should enter into Telex in the U.S., it adopted the original style and Type A signaling. Similarly, many other Europeans adopted Type A operations, among them the U.K., France and Belgium as well as others. Meantime, (I think it was L. M. Ericsson leading the move for) others saw an opportunity to simply use the numerics on the keyboard for call set-up, thus some nations adopted what became known as “Type B” Telex. By this time, the CCITT had taken charge and was setting international agreements, one of which was to set the speed of international Baudot circuits at 50 Baud, instead of 45.5. Some few nations were many years behind in upspeeding. In this writer’s experience, Cuba and Pakistan are remembered as still running 45.5 Baud Telex trunks even into the 1970’s.</p>
<p>Telex grew around the world very rapidly … long before automatic telephony, again most likely due to its economics of channel usage. Considerable networks of Telex on HF (shortwave) radio to then-remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia were established by the government-owned PTTs, operating non-stop with …</p></div></article></div>

    <p id="desc">Why pretrained machine learning models are often unusable and irreproducible — and
      what we can do about it.</p>
    <p id="by_who">By <a href="https://www.twitter.com/abidlabs/">Abubakar Abid</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    
    
  
    <p>In this paper from Google, the authors release a model that decomposes images of objects into a set of images, each of which contain one individual object. They train models on a specific dataset, CLEVR, which contains synthetic images of simple geometric objects and release the models. Here we run their pretrained model on an example image from the CLEVR dataset:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*n7JkSFvi99vIVEQ8biBDkA.gif">

    <p>So far so good. But how general is this model? Can we use it to segment other kinds of objects? Here’s the result when we use an image of furniture: the model does not throw any errors, but it fails horribly:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*q0GwW-jP5NvIn5TrupGfJw.gif">

    <p>Okay, so perhaps the model only works with geometric objects. Let’s make a slight adjustment to the original image we used, and increase the brightness of its background. As a user, we would reasonably expect the model to be fairly robust to such simple transformations — certainly our human ability to decompose objects is. However, the model is anything but robust:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*WC7TAORpQdbTm8HRzx2v8A.gif">

    <p>I should be clear here — I don’t think that the model is at fault, nor the authors. The model works very well on the task that it was trained and tested on: decomposing objects in the original CLEVR dataset. However, as a user of the pretrained model, I do not know a priori whether the model will handle other kinds of images. There is no contract that tells me the model should only be used with the original images from the CLEVR dataset.</p>

    You might be thinking that these models are designed for very specific datasets; they are not meant to be generally used with real-world images. However, the situation can be even worse for models designed to work with natural images…

    <h3>3. When input data needs to satisfy other hard-to-define constraints</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Unfolding the Alternating Optimization for Blind Super Resolution
    </p>
    
    

    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.
    </p>

							<p>One of the biggest challenges of internet investigation is preserving data once you’ve found it. We have access to more information than ever before, but so much of it can be easily lost if we don’t take steps to archive it. If you’ve ever bookmarked an important resource only to come back later and see that it’s no longer available, you’ll know how frustrating it can be. I wrote about this problem last year in <a href="https://nixintel.info/osint/the-attrition-of-information-in-osint-why-acting-quickly-matters-and-how-to-recover-when-you-dont/">this post about the Attrition of Information In OSINT</a> along with some suggestions about how to preserve internet material as well as how to recover data when it has been removed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> is probably the most familiar tool for preserving web pages but it is not without its limitations. It can’t capture Facebook pages for instance, and even if you instruct it to begin archiving a site then it can easily fail if that site’s robots.txt prevents crawling. The increasing use of Javascript and embedded video content also makes scraping and archiving webpages more difficult. The preserved site you find on the Internet Archive is often missing much of the original content and features.</p>
<p>To counter this it is necessary to use several types of tool to preserve web content for your investigations rather than just relying on one. Hunchly is excellent for capturing web pages, but I still like to supplement it with YouTube-dl for grabbing video content. Recently I’ve also started using <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Quickstart">Archive Box</a> to build offline archives of web content that I want to keep. It wasn’t designed with OSINT work in mind but it is perfectly suited to the task of preserving and archiving web pages in multiple formats, including JavaScript-based websites and PDF/PNG screenshots. Video and audio content can also been downloaded and preserved.</p>
<p>Archive Box can build full archives of the websites listed in your bookmarks, browser history, or from a list of custom URLs that you provide. In the rest of this post I’ll show you how you can set up and install Archive Box and start to archive your own pages.</p>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>Archive Box is written in Python and runs on Linux and Mac OS. It makes use of the native Linux/Mac programs like curl and wget to grab a lot of data so unlike many other Python tools it won’t run in Windows. If you want to use Archive Box in a Windows environment then you’ll need to install and run it with Docker as per these instructions <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker">here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest version (0.4.21) of Archive Box is available via Pypi, so that’s what we’ll install in this guide. It requires Python 3.7 or higher to run. I use Linux or MacOS for most tools like this but Archive Box will also run on Windows provided that you have <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows">already installed Python/Pip</a>.</p>
<p>To check your current version of Python 3 enter the console and type:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ python3 -V</code></p>
<p>If the version is less than 3.7, you’ll need to install a more up to date version of Python.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed Python 3.7 (or higher), you can install Archive Box directly from PyPi with the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ pip install archivebox</code></p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Python and Pip, have a read of <a href="https://nixintel.info/linux/build-your-own-custom-osint-machine-part-4/">this post</a> I wrote last year. If you’re using MacOS you can install Archive Box with Brew:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ brew install archivebox</code></p>
<p>There’s also a Docker image available for Archive Box which means you can also run it on Windows, you’ll just need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nX8U8Fz5S0">set up Docker first</a>. These days I prefer to use Docker images for OSINT tools but that’s for a future blog post.</p>
<p>Next you need to create a directory where your archive will be stored and complete the Archive Box setup there:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ mkdir myarchive &amp;&amp; cd myarchive 
$ archivebox init</pre>
<p>Once installation has finished, you’ll be ready to start building your archive.</p>
<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>All commands take the following format:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox [command] [argument]</code></p>
<p>To archive a single webpage, use the following command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info'</pre>
<p>It’s also possible to add recursion to your request, so not only do you archive the page you specify, but Archive Box will also follow every link on the page and archive that too. The greater the depth, the further it will follow the links. Recursion can be added with the following option:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info' --depth=1</pre>
<p>This will now archive the site and follow all the links within it to a depth of 1, and then archive all those pages too.</p>
<h3>Viewing The Archive</h3>
<p>Here’s the start of my new archive:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png" alt="" width="1458" height="295" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-300x61.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-768x155.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-1536x311.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></p>
<p>To view your archive, open your browser and navigate to the index.html file in archive folder you created. It’ll be something like /home/username/myarchive/index.html. The archive records the time you created it, the link that was saved, and the original URL. Clicking on “Files” will show just how powerful Archive Box is:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png" alt="" width="1145" height="592" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-300x155.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-768x397.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-1536x794.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1145px) 100vw, 1145px"></p>
<p>The front page of my website has been saved as an offline local archive (complete with all necessary JavaScript so the appearance is identical to the live version), as pure HTML/CSS, as a PDF, a PNG screenshot, and you’ll also notice that Archive Box has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811201133/https://nixintel.info/">even archived a copy on the WayBack Machine too</a>. So now I have a full working archive of my site saved locally on my machine. This is a much better way to preserve a webpage than with simple screenshots, and even if the original site were to disappear (I hope not) I’d still have a full offline copy to work with.</p>
<h3>Archiving Multiple Websites</h3>
<p>An archive with one site in it isn’t much fun. Fortunately Archive Box also makes it easy to archive multiple sites at once, either from a list of URLs, or from your browser’s saved bookmarks. To archive multiple websites, create a text file like this, with one URL on each line.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">https://osintcurio.us
https://bbc.co.uk/football 
https://theguardian.com</pre>
<p>Then we enter the following command (assuming your URL list is in the same directory as your archive):</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ cat url_list.txt | archivebox add</code></p>
<p>After a few minutes, all the listed websites have been added to my offline archive in the same range of formats as before:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png" alt="" width="1974" height="390" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png 1974w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-300x59.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-768x152.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-1536x303.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1974px) 100vw, 1974px"></p>
<p>The archive of the BBC Football page shows the advantage of saving in multiple formats. The site features a lot of custom video streams that can’t really be archived offline, so the local archive looks a little odd:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png" alt="" width="1063" height="500" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-300x141.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-768x361.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-1536x722.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1063px) 100vw, 1063px"></p>
<p>Despite this the fact that PDF and PNG versions of the site are also created means we can still see what the site was like at the time it was archived. You’ll also notice a limitation of the Wayback Machine that I mentioned earlier. If a site doesn’t want to be crawled by the Wayback Machine, the only thing that will be preserved is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811204518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/football/">301 error</a>. Archiving in multiple formats means that the chances of material being lost is significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Video Content</h3>
<p>Archive Box uses YouTube-dl so that it can archive video content too. Let’s say that you want to add <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be">this OSINTCurious Ten Minute Tip</a> to your archive. You can run the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be</code></p>
<p>The entire 10 Minute Tip will now saved to your archive, including the video and audio files.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png" alt="" width="1098" height="290" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-300x79.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-768x203.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-1536x406.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"></p>
<p>To access the archived video/audio, click on the “Media” link on the right. You’ll see that the video, audio and thumbnail content have all been archived and preserved offline:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png" alt="" width="933" height="238" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png 933w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-300x77.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-768x196.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<h3>Archiving Your Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Archive Box also allows you to create archives of websites saved in your bookmarks. Simply export a list of bookmarks from your browser (see instructions <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en">here</a> for Chrome and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer">here</a> for Firefox) as an HTML file and point Archive Box at it:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add /path/to/bookmarks.html</code></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Being able to capture and preserve web content is a core skill for OSINT investigators. There are several technical challenges that make this difficult but Archive Box is a very effective way of gathering and preserving the information that you need.</p>
<p>Archive Box is in active development and it continues to receive new features and updates, so some elements of this post might become outdated in time. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveBoxApp">@ArchiveBoxApp</a> on Twitter for the latest updates.</p>

                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/6fcaac97-a79b-4d89-982d-fe0823edb7e0/ColSanders.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""><br><em>"It's not his fault he doesn't know mal Bogle" says Col. Sanders</em></p>
<p>"I was once cursed by a warlock," says Col. Harlan Sanders, in not even his most unhinged piece of dialogue on this General Hospital episode.</p>
<p>Sanders is visiting character Maxie Jones to request she secure his secret recipe (all 11 herbs and spices), which had been threatened by a bomb Sanders himself defused using the classic esolang Malbolge. Unfortunately, this all happens offscreen.</p>
<p>Damian Spinelli, mentioned by Sanders, is a private investigator / hacker who General Hospital's casting describes as a mix between Seth Green and Sean Penn's Spicoli. Spinelli is unable to defuse the bomb, not knowing Malbolge, but Sanders had picked up a little of the Turing Tarpit as one randomly does (apparently without learning how to pronounce it) and saves the (only copy of this?) recipe from being incinerated.</p>
<p>Sanders feels no reservations about then asking Jones to then hide this recipe which has attracted this violence, which she does without question.</p>
<p>The full scene is here in two parts:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO8tIMQHFig" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J3bI261tBQ" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>For those who suspect this is created by a prankster, here it is tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/generalhospital/status/1015384908192190464?lang=en" target="">the show's account</a>.</p>

<p>Why, once again, is the esolang Malbolge chosen for an absurd tv storyline?</p>
<p>It is almost certainly tied to Malbolge's explicit connection with encryption; Malbolge programs self-encrypt as they run and writing Malbolge programs is a matter of finding "weaknesses" in the system that can be exploited in order to write working programs. While brainfuck is by far the widest-known esolang among programmers, Malbolge occasionally, and quite randomly, appears in a wider cultural context, always in terms of leetness, encryption, and mystery. Most likely, the General Hospital writers picked it up watching <em>Elementary</em>, which <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-ben-olmstead" target="">included a Malbolge program left as a clue</a> from a killer.</p>
<p>Malbolge is the focus of the "weird internet," most notably in the <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/a-malbolge-mystery-c0d3-attorney" target="">still-unexplained site c0d3.attorney</a>. While c0d3.attorney does not offer any insight into Malbolge—the "programs" it lists don't work—it, like General Hospital, affirms Malbolge's status as <em>the</em> weird esolang. Ben Olmstead, Malbolge's creator, comments on the appearance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything, I think it illustrates how random culture can be: a weird throwaway thing—made in an afternoon—gets referenced on popular TV shows, has academic papers written about it, and still gets mentions on Twitter, 20 something years later. Meanwhile, people put in years or decades of work to create things that just... disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is how things work when your work of art or code helps inspire so much that comes after it.</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-networking-is-simple/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-networking-is-simple/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
Working with containers always feels like magic. In a good way for those who understand the internals and in a terrifying - for those who don't. Luckily, we've been looking under the hood of the containerization technology for quite some time already and even managed to uncover that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/not-every-container-has-an-operating-system-inside/#container-is-just-a-processes">containers are just isolated and restricted Linux processes</a>, that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-dont-need-an-image-to-run-a-container/">images aren't really needed to run containers</a>, and on the contrary - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-need-containers-to-build-an-image/">to build an image we need to run some containers</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes a time to tackle the container networking problem. Or, more precisely, a single-host container networking problem. In this article, we are going to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to virtualize network resources to make containers think each of them has a dedicated network stack?</li>
<li>How to turn containers into friendly neighbors, prevent them from interfering, and teach to communicate well?</li>
<li>How to reach the outside world (e.g. the Internet) from inside the container?</li>
<li>How to reach containers running on a machine from the outside world (<em>aka</em> port publishing)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it'll become apparent that the single-host container networking is nothing more than a simple combination of the well-known Linux facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespaces;</li>
<li>virtual Ethernet devices (veth);</li>
<li>virtual network switches (bridge);</li>
<li>IP routing and network address translation (NAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>And for better or worse, no code is required to make the networking magic happen...
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Any decent Linux distribution would probably suffice. All the examples in the article have been made on a fresh <em>vagrant</em> CentOS 8 virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant init centos/8
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.0-147.3.1.el8_1.x86_64</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of simplicity of the examples, in this article, we are not going to rely on any fully-fledged containerization solution (e.g. <em>docker</em> or <em>podman</em>). Instead, we'll focus on the basic concepts and use the bare minimum tooling to achieve our learning goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-namenetnsaisolating-containers-with-network-namespaces"><a name="netns"></a>Isolating containers with network namespaces</h2>
<p>What constitutes a Linux network stack? Well, obviously, the set of network devices. What else? Probably, the set of routing rules. And not to forget, the set of netfilter hooks, including defined by iptables rules.</p>
<p>We can quickly forge a non-comprehensive <code>inspect-net-stack.sh</code> script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "&gt; Network devices"
ip link

echo -e "\n&gt; Route table"
ip route

echo -e "\n&gt; Iptables rules"
iptables --list-rules</code></pre>
<p>Before running it, let's taint the iptables rules a bit to make them recognizable:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo iptables -N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>After that, execution of the inspect script on my machine produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

&gt; Route table
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>We are interested in that output because we want to make sure that each of the containers we are going to create soon will get a separate network stack.</p>
<p>Well, you might have heard already, that one of the Linux namespaces used for containers isolation is called <em>network namespace</em>. From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html"><code>man ip-netns</code></a>, <em>"network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices."</em> For the sake of simplicity, this is the only namespace we're going to use in this article. Instead of creating fully-isolated containers, we'd rather restrict the scope to only the network stack.</p>
<p>One of the ways to create a network namespace is the <code>ip</code> tool - part of the de facto standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip netns add netns0
$ ip netns
netns0</code></pre>
<p>How to start using the just created namespace? There is a lovely Linux command called <code>nsenter</code>. It enters one or more of the specified namespaces and then executes the given program:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0 bash
# The newly created bash process lives in netns0

$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

&gt; Route table

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p>From the output above it's clear that the <em>bash</em> process running inside <code>netns0</code> namespace sees a totally different network stack. There is no routing rules at all, no custom iptables chain, and only one loopback network device. So far, so good...</p>

<h2 id="a-namevethaconnecting-containers-to-host-with-virtual-ethernet-devices-veth"><a name="veth"></a>Connecting containers to host with virtual Ethernet devices (veth)</h2>
<p>A dedicated network stack would be not so useful if we could not communicate with it. Luckily, Linux provides a suitable facility for that - a virtual Ethernet device! From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html"><code>man veth</code></a>, <em>"veth devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."</em></p>
<p>Virtual Ethernet devices always go in pairs. No worries, it'll be clear when we take a look at the creation command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0</code></pre>
<p>With this single command, we just created a pair of <em>interconnected</em> virtual Ethernet devices. The names <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> have been chosen arbitrarily:</p>
<pre><code>$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: ceth0@veth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@ceth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> after creation resides on the host's network stack (also called root network namespace). To connect the root namespace with the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we need to keep one of the devices in the root namespace and move another one into the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0

# List all the devices to make sure one of them disappeared from the root stack
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

January 19, 2021 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We recently announced a license change: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">FAQ</a>. We posted some <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification">additional guidance</a> on the license change this morning. I wanted to share why we had to make this change.
</p><p>This was an incredibly hard decision, especially with my background and history around Open Source. I take our responsibility very seriously. And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. It has no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises. Its goal, hopefully, is pretty clear.
</p><p>So why the change? AWS and Amazon Elasticsearch Service. They have been doing things that we think are just NOT OK since 2015 and it has only gotten worse. If we don’t stand up to them now, as a successful company and leader in the market, who will?
</p><p>Our license change is aimed at preventing companies from taking our Elasticsearch and Kibana products and providing them directly as a service without collaborating with us.
</p><p>Our license change comes after years of what we believe to be Amazon/AWS misleading and confusing the community - enough is enough.
</p><p>We’ve tried every avenue available including going through the courts, but with AWS’s  ongoing behavior, we have decided to change our license so that we can focus on building products and innovating rather than litigating.
</p><p>AWS’s behavior has forced us to take this step and we do not do so lightly. If they had not acted as they have, we would not be having this discussion today.
</p><p>We think that Amazon’s behavior is inconsistent with the norms and values that are especially important in the open source ecosystem. Our hope is to take our presence in the market and use it to stand up to this now so others don’t face these same issues in the future.
</p><p>In the open source world, trademarks are considered a great and positive way to protect product reputation. Trademarks have been used and enforced broadly. They are considered sacred by the open source community, from small projects to foundations like Apache to companies like RedHat. So imagine our surprise when Amazon launched their service in 2015 based on Elasticsearch and called it Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We consider this to be a pretty obvious trademark violation. NOT OK.
</p><p>I took a personal loan to register the Elasticsearch trademark in 2011 believing in this norm in the open source ecosystem. Seeing the trademark so blatantly misused was especially painful to me. Our efforts to resolve the problem with Amazon failed, forcing us to file a lawsuit. NOT OK.
</p><p>We have seen that this trademark issue drives confusion with users thinking Amazon Elasticsearch Service is actually a service provided jointly with Elastic, with our blessing and collaboration. This is just not true. NOT OK.
</p><p>When the service launched, imagine our surprise when the Amazon CTO tweeted that the service was released in collaboration with us. It was not. And over the years, we have heard repeatedly that this confusion persists. NOT OK.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc3e3a971d3b695d3/6006e46a0069f70f7771dab5/amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltc3e3a971d3b695d3" alt="amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg"></p><p>When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.
</p><p>More on this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">here</a>. NOT OK.
</p><p>Recently, we found more examples of what we consider to be ethically challenged behavior. We have differentiated with proprietary features, and now we see these feature designs serving as "inspiration" for Amazon, telling us their behavior continues and is more brazen. NOT OK.
</p><p>We collaborate with cloud service providers, including Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Clever Cloud, and others. We have shown we can find a way to do it. We even work with other parts of Amazon. We are always open to doing that; it just needs to be OK.
</p><p>I believe in the core values of the Open Source Community: transparency, collaboration, openness. Building great products to the benefit of users across the world. Amazing things have been built and will continue to be built using Elasticsearch and Kibana.
</p><p>And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. And no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises.
</p><p>We created Elasticsearch; we care about it more than anyone else. It is our life’s work. We will wake up every day and do more to move the technology forward and innovate on your behalf.
</p><p>Thanks for listening. If you have more questions or you want more clarification please read <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">here</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:elastic_license@elastic.co">elastic_license@elastic.co</a>.
</p><p>Thank you. It is a privilege to be on this journey with you.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <section>
    <p><img src="https://www.lffl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/microsoft-powershell.jpg" alt="Linux and powershell"></p>
<h2 id="what-powershell">What powershell?</h2>
<p><strong>Powershell</strong> is an object-based shell born in Microsoft in 2006, made open source 10 years later. It is characterized by commands, called <em>cmdlets</em>, which respect a certain pattern. An example cmdlet is as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>value</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The pattern in question is <code>Verb-Noun -Option argument</code>, where <em>Verb</em> is a list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.1">verbs</a>. <em>Noun</em> is a description of what impacts the command verb. The <em>Option</em> instead are preceded by a dash and its name; to follow, all the <em>arguments</em> of the option.</p>
<p>This pattern guarantees two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>readability</strong>: if you read the command, you know what it does. For example, the previous command shows that: I get all the child objects of a given path (files and folders).</li>
<li><strong>standard</strong>: following such a strict standard, it is possible to introduce various new commands already knowing (thanks to readability) what they do.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-powershell-on-linux">Why powershell on Linux?</h2>
<p>Linux has a great scripting tool: <em>bash</em> . Bash is a shell that provides us with a very simple but effective scripting language to write various automatisms. The only problem with bash is that any output is a string and must be treated as such; therefore, we use the same task we took as an example in powershell; we list the files and directories in a given path:</p>
<p>The output produced by this command is a string, so if we need to search for something we have to pass the output as the input of another command, through the pipeline.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ls -l path <span>|</span> grep whatever
</code></pre></div><p>Each powershell output is an object. Each object has its own properties that can be used through other cmdlets. For example, the above command will output a <strong>System.Array</strong> type. This type of object can be used by an iterator (such as the <code>for</code> loop) or by a filter cmdlet, such as <code>Where-Object</code>.</p>
<p>Powershell is an excellent tool for a linux distribution because it offers a series of commands useful for developing tools and automatisms that are very difficult to implement with simple strings.</p>
<h2 id="installation-on-linux">Installation on Linux</h2>
<p>Depending on your distribution, installing powershell on Linux is a fairly simple task. If you have Debian or Ubuntu, we can install it thanks to <em>snapd</em> , like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ sudo apt install snapd
$ snap install powershell
</code></pre><p>Instead on Red Hat based distributions, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft.repo
$ sudo yum install -y powershell
</code></pre><p>To activate powershell, just type <code>pwsh</code>.</p>
<h3 id="other-distribution">Other distribution</h3>
<p>For installation on other distributions refer to the official Microsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1">installation page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scripts-and-modules-automations">Scripts and modules: automations</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of powershell is that you can save commands and various code parts in script and module files.</p>
<h3 id="scripts">Scripts</h3>
<p>To create a script file, just write powershell to a file with the <em>.ps1</em> extension, and parse it to the <code>pwsh</code> interpreter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span># file myscript.ps1</span>

<span># Get all file modified in the last 3 days</span>
<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We have created a script that tells us all files changed in the last 3 days. Fantastic. Now let’s call it from the command line: <code>pwsh myscript.ps1</code></p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Not all tasks are sequential commands and not all tasks can be contained in a single powershell file. For this, we will use module to collect our functions.</p>
<p>Let’s take the script from earlier. Let’s turn it into a function and put it into a module. The module consists of a module file with the extension <code>.psm1</code> and a module manifest file with the extension<code> .psd1</code>. First, let’s create the module.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mkdir mymodule
$ touch mymodule/mymodule.psm1
$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.1.1
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS &gt; New-ModuleManifest -Path mymodule/mymodule.psd1 -ModuleVersion "0.0.1" -Author "YourNameHere"
</code></pre><p>We have created the structure of the module. Now, let’s do a function called <code>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</code> containing the above script.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psm1</span>

<span>New-Alias</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>"ls3"</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span><span>(</span><span>$Path</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>$Path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  		<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now edit our <em>mymodule.psd1</em> manifest file to add our function and alias for export. Find these two variables and edit them as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psd1</span>
<span>$FunctionsToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles'</span><span>)</span>
<span>$AliasesToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'ls3'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now copy our module folder <code>mymodule</code> to the following path (for all users) <code>/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules</code> or <code>~/.local/share/powershell/Modules</code> (for your user), and open new powershell session:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ls3</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="most-used-modules">Most used modules</h2>
<p>Of course it is possible to install modules from the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">official repository</a>, for various uses. On a Linux distribution, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/PSCouchDB">PSCouchDB module</a> is useful if you are an administrator of a no-sql database such as CouchDB.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Install-Module</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>PSCouchDB</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-CouchDBDatabase</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This module simplifies the management of the databases and documents that define the characteristic structure of CouchDB. Alternatively, you can use <code>curl</code> but commands for complex tasks will be very long.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, the goal of powershell in general is to facilitate the end user in scripting simple and complex tasks. Bash is a great tool for many tasks, but powershell can help solve some problems like filtering complex output, thanks to its object-oriented structure. Definitely a great choice for many activities.</p>

            <strong>Figure: Finding the words to say</strong><br>
            After a language model generates a sentence, we can visualize a view of how the model came by each word (column).  Each row is a model layer. The value and color indicate the ranking of the output token at that layer. The darker the color, the higher the ranking. Layer 0 is at the top. Layer 47 is at the bottom.<br>

<p>Part 2: Continuing the pursuit of making Transformer language models more transparent, this article showcases a collection of visualizations to uncover mechanics of language generation inside a pre-trained language model. These visualizations are all created using <a href="https://www.eccox.io/">Ecco</a>, the open-source package we're releasing

</p><p>In the first part of this series, <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/explaining-transformers/">Interfaces for Explaining Transformer Language Models</a>, we showcased interactive interfaces for input saliency and neuron activations. In this article, we will focus on the hidden state as it evolves from model layer to the next. By looking at the hidden states produced by every transformer decoder block, we aim to gleam information about how a language model arrived at a specific output token. This method is explored by Voita et al.<cite key="voita2019bottom"></cite>. Nostalgebraist <cite key="nostalgebraist2020"></cite>
        presents compelling visual treatments showcasing the evolution of token rankings, logit scores, and softmax
        probabilities for the evolving hidden state through the various layers of the model.

<h2>Recap: Transformer Hidden States</h2>
<p>The following figure recaps how a transformer language model works. How the layers result in a final hidden state. And how that final state is then projected to the output vocabulary which results in a score assigned to each token in
        the model's vocabulary. We can see here the top scoring tokens when DistilGPT2 is fed the input sequence " 1, 1,
        ":</p>
<figure>
        <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/transformer-language-model-steps.png">
        <figcaption>
            <strong>Figure: Recap of transformer language models.</strong><br>
            This figure shows how the model arrives at the top five output token candidates and their probability scores. This shows us that at the final layer, the
            model is 59% sure the next token is ' 1', and that would be chosen as the output token by greedy decoding.
            Other probable outputs include ' 2' with 18% probability (maybe we are counting) and ' 0' with 5%
            probability (maybe we are counting down).
        </figcaption>
    </figure><p>

Ecco provides a view of the model's top scoring tokens and their probability scores.


</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="py"><span># Generate one token to complete this input string
</span><span>output</span> <span>=</span> <span>lm</span><span>.</span><span>generate</span><span>(</span><span>" 1, 1, 1,"</span><span>,</span> <span>generate</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

Which would show the following breakdown of candidate output tokens and their probability scores:

            <strong>Figure: Ten tokens with highest probabilities at the final layer of the model.</strong><br>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

<h2>Scores after each layer</h2>
<p>Applying the same projection to internal hidden states of the model gives us a view of how the model's conviction
        for the output scoring developed over the processing of the inputs. This projection of internal hidden states
        gives us a sense of which layer contributed the most to elevating the scores (and hence ranking) of a certain
        potential output token.</p>

<p>Viewing the evolution of the hidden states means that instead of looking only at the candidates output tokens from
        projecting the final model state, we can look at the top scoring tokens after projecting the hidden state
        resulting from each of the model's six layers.</p><p>


This visualization is created using the same method above with omitting the 'layer' argument (which we set to the final layer in the previous example, layer #5):

Resulting in:

        <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure: Top scoring tokens after each of the model's six layers.</strong>
        <br>
            Each row shows the top ten predicted tokens obtained by projecting each hidden state to the output
            vocabulary. The probability scores are shown in pink (obtained by passing logit scores through softmax). We
            can see that <strong>Layer 0</strong> has no digits in its top ten predictions. <strong>Layer 1</strong>
            gives the token ' 1' a 0.03%, probability which, while low, still ranks the token as the seventh highest
            ranking token. Subsequent layers keep elevating the probability and ranking of ' 1', until <strong>the final
            layer</strong> injects a bit more caution by reducing the probability from 100% to ~60%, still retaining the
            token as the highest ranked in the model's output.<br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> This figure is incorrect in showing 0 probability assigned to some tokens due to rounding. The current version of Ecco fixes this by showing '&lt;0.01%'.

<h3>Evolution of the selected token</h3>

        <figcaption>
            <strong>The ranking of the token ' 1' after each layer</strong><br>
            <strong>Layer 0</strong> elevated the token ' 1' to be the 31st highest scored token in the hidden state it
            produced. <strong>Layers 1 and 2</strong> kept increasing the ranking (to 7 then 5 respectively). All the
            <strong>following layers</strong> were sure this is the best token and gave it the top ranking spot.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>Another visual perspective on the evolving hidden states is to re-examine the hidden states after selecting an output
        token to see how the hidden state after each layer ranked that token. This is one of the many perspectives
        explored by Nostalgebraist <cite key="nostalgebraist2020"></cite>
        and the one we think is a great first approach. In the figure on the side, we can see the ranking (out of
        +50,0000 tokens in the model's vocabulary) of the token ' 1' where each row
        indicates a layer's output.
    </p>

<p>The same visualization can then be plotted for an entire generated sequence, where each column indicates a
        generation step (and its output token), and each row the ranking of
        the output token at each layer:
    </p>

        <figcaption>
            <strong>Evolution of the rankings of the output sequence ' 1 , 1'</strong><br>
            We can see that <strong>Layer 3</strong> is the point at which the model started to be certain of
            the digit ' 1' as the output. <br><strong>When the output is to be a comma</strong>, Layer 0 usually ranks
            the comma as 5. <br>
            <strong>When the output is to be a ' 1'</strong>, Layer 0 is less certain, but still ranks the ' 1' token at
            31 or 32.
            Notice that every output token is ranked #1 after Layer 5. That is the definition of <strong>greedy
            sampling</strong> -- the reason we selected this token is because it was ranked first.

<p>Visualizaing the evolution of the hidden states sheds light on how various layers contribute to generating this sequence as we can see in the following figure:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Columns of solid pink corresponding to newlines and periods. Starting from Layer #0 and onwards, the model is certain early on of these tokens, indicating Layer #0's awareness of certain syntactic properties (and that later layers raise no objections).</li>
                <li>
                    Columns where country names are predicted are very bright at the top and it's up to the last five layers to really come up with the appropriate token.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Columns tracking the incrementing number tend to be resolved at layer #9.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The model erroneously lists Chile in the list, not a EU country. But notice that the ranking of that token is 43 -- indicating the error is better attributed to our token sampling method rather than to the model itself. In the case of all other countries they were correct and in the top 3.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Aside from Chile, the rest of the countries are correct, but also follow the alphabetical order followed in the input sequence.

            While the final output succeeds in assigning the correct number, the first five layers surprisingly fail at
            identifying the correct number (by giving " is" a higher ranking than " are", which is the correct answer).

<p>We are not limited to watching the evolution of only one (the selected) token for a specific position. There are
        cases where we want to compare the rankings of multiple tokens <i>in the same position</i> regardless if the model selected them or not. </p>
 <p>One such case is the number prediction task described by Linzen et al.<cite key="linzen2016assessing"></cite>
        which arises from the English language phenomenon of subject-verb agreement. In that task, we want to analyze the
        model's capacity to encode <i>syntactic number</i> (whether the subject we're addressing is singular or plural)
        and <i>syntactic subjecthood</i> (which subject in the sentence we're addressing).

    <div>
      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I started working on getting Racket CS to
compile and run on iOS and, with a lot of guidance from Matthew Flatt,
I managed to get it working (with some <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/351c0047d6371e36cf422b4627e020d14e8853fe/racket/src/ChezScheme/c/segment.c#L578-L587">caveats</a>).  <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3607">Those
changes</a> have now been merged, so I figured I’d write another <a href="https://defn.io/2020/01/05/racket-on-ios/">one
of these guides</a> while the information is still fresh in my head.</p>
<h2 id="compile-racket-for-macos-and-for-ios">Compile Racket for macOS and for iOS</h2>
<p>You need a recent version of Racket and it’s associated fork of Chez
Scheme built for your host machine in order to cross-compile things.
To build both of them, clone the <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket">Racket repository</a> and follow the
<a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/08fa24304ebf80a21ade32e8e59bb51b27af1dae/build.md#1-building-racket-from-source">build instructions</a>.  If you use the default <code>make</code> target, then
you’ll end up with a host Racket installation overlayed on top of the
<code>racket/</code> directory in the repository and with a build of Chez Scheme
at <code>racket/src/build/cs/c/</code>.</p>
<p>Next, you can cross-compile Racket CS for iOS by making a new build
directory within <code>racket/src/</code> and configuring a cross build by
specifying a custom prefix (so that the <code>make install</code> step won’t
overwrite the host Racket installation), the target <code>host</code>
architecture, a path to the iOS SDK (or the shorthand name “iPhoneOS”)
and the paths to the host Racket and Chez Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-xcode-project">Set up your XCode project</h2>
<p>To link against and use Racket CS within an XCode project, copy
<code>racketcs.h</code>, <code>racketcsboot.h</code> and <code>chezscheme.h</code> from
<code>racket-ios/include/</code> into a sub-directory of your project, then add
that sub-directory to the “Header Search Paths” section under your
project’s “Build Settings” tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-headers.png" alt="Headers"></p>
<p>Then, disable Bitcode from the same section.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-bitcode.png" alt="Bitcode"></p>
<p>Next, copy <code>libracketcs.a</code>, <code>petite.boot</code>, <code>scheme.boot</code> and
<code>racket.boot</code> from <code>racket-ios/lib</code> into a sub-directory of your
project called <code>vendor/</code> and drag-and-drop the <code>vendor/</code> directory
into your XCode project.  Then, instruct XCode to link <code>libracketcs.a</code>
and <code>libiconv.tbd</code> with your code from the “Build Phases” tab.  You’ll
have to add <code>libracketcs.a</code> to your project using the “Add Other…”
sub-menu.</p>

<p>Next, add a new C source file called <code>vendor.c</code> and answer “yes” if
prompted to create a bridging header for Swift.  I tend to re-name the
bridging header to plain <code>bridge.h</code> because I don’t like the name that
XCode generates by default.  If you do this, you’ll have to update the
“Objective-C Bridging Header” setting in your “Build Settings” tab.

January 19, 2021 | https://sin-ack.github.io/posts/morphic-intro/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sin-ack.github.io/posts/morphic-intro/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In my previous two posts, I talked about Self as the language, and the system
which allows it to serialize objects into text format. Now let’s talk about
another big part of Self, which is the programming environment and the UI
toolkit that it is created from: Morphic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-morphic">What is Morphic?</h2>
<p>Morphic is an abstract UI toolkit built for Self. It has backends for X11 and
Quartz, for GNU/Linux and macOS respectively. It is based on the idea of
<em>morphs</em>, which are known as widgets in modern UI toolkits. The difference here,
obviously, is the prototypical approach; it is after all written entirely in
Self, and so employs a prototypical-inheritance programming paradigm. All morphs
have a family tree that can be traced back to the original <code>morph</code> which
provides the building blocks for implementing your own morphs.</p>
<p>Now, consider this scenario: an update to Morphic is made (this scenario is
hypothetical), and a new field is added to the root <code>morph</code> object which must
propagate to all other morphs and is needed to display the morphs. Or a simpler
scenario; you want to change a default for all morphs and you want this change
to propagate to all other morphs. However, you might remember that we previously
talked about how instances in Self work and specifically, how they work by
<em>copying a prototype</em>. So how can we easily propagate new slot information from
parents to copied children? The answer is <strong>copy-downs</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="copy-downs">Copy-downs</h2>
<p>“Copy-down” is what Self calls replicating slots that exist in another object,
and updating those slots when that object changes. You may remember in the
previous post that an object had a few slots related to copy-down in its
annotation section.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self2/object_annotations.png" alt="The annotations that are available on an object."> <figcaption>
            <p>The annotations that are available on an object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the previous post we ignored these, but when programming in Morphic
copy-downs are important, so I’ll go into detail here. Copy-downs work by
sending the “copy-down selector” as a message to the “copy-down parent” (which
is an object), and then copying down the slots (except the ones listed in “slots
to omit”). This allows changes to parent objects to propagate as long as the
change is not omitted. This is similar to “sub-classing” in that it “inherits”
slots from a parent.</p>
<p>Copy-down is not a part of the Self language, but instead of the programming
environment that comes with it, and its implementation is done entirely within
annotations and the mirror system (we’ll look into mirrors later, just know that
mirrors are Self’s reflection system).</p>
<p><a href="https://handbook.selflanguage.org/2017.1/howtoprg.html#copy-down">The handbook section about
copy-down</a>
gives some important information about copy-downs, but nothing that is really
omitted here. At the end it mentions this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The least convenient aspect of using copy-downs is that to do the moral equivalent of creating a subclass, the programmer has to create two objects: a new traits object, and a new prototype, and then set the object annotation of the new prototype. Perhaps someday there will be a button to do this, or perhaps other styles of programming will emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out this document is outdated, as we <em>do</em> have a way to do this in Self
now which we will take advantage of in a short bit, when we start building our
own morph. For now, let’s take a look at what a morph actually is.</p>
<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-a-morph">The anatomy of a morph</h2>
<p>When we get the root morph prototype by typing <code>morph</code> in the shell and then
“Get it”, we get this object:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/morph_prototype.png" alt="The prototype morph."> <figcaption>
            <p>The prototype
<code>morph</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most of the slots here isn’t of concern to us, because they are managed
automatically by Morphic when we send it messages (either directly with an
evaluator, or by interacting with the morph directly). A few points that might
be interesting are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hResizing</code>/<code>vResizing</code>: These determine how the object sizes itself
according to its parent or its children. There are three modes of resizing in
Morphic, which are:
<ul>
<li>Rigid: The object stays at its defined width and height and does not change
its size based on its surroundings, parents or children.</li>
<li>Shrink-wrap: The object resizes to wrap around its contents, and does not
grow larger.</li>
<li>Flexible (or space-filling): The object enlarges to fill available space.
If multiple sibling objects have this property, they all distribute the
width/height equally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>noStickOuts</code>: Morphic optimizes drawing if the morph is a simple rectangle
with nothing sticking out of it.</li>
<li><code>velcroFlag</code>: Kind of a weirdly named one. If this is <code>true</code> then the
submorphs of this morph cannot be yanked from the morph, and you cannot
drag-and-drop new submorphs to this morph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different “subclasses” of <code>morph</code> have their own unique slots. Thankfully,
the authors of Morphic have categorized each morph’s slots such that a morph
that is copied down from another will have its unique slots under a separate
category, which makes it a lot easier to see what belongs to which morph.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/morph_categories.png" alt="The frameMorph is copied down from rowMorph, which was itself copied down from morph. Each link in the chain categorizes its own slots separately."> <figcaption>
            <p>The
<code>frameMorph</code> is copied down from <code>rowMorph</code>, which was
itself copied down from <code>morph</code>. Each link in the chain categorizes
its own slots separately.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each morph may only appear once. If you use “Show Morph” on an outliner for a
morph that already exists somewhere else, it will remove itself from there and
attach it to your hand (similar to the Javascript DOM in this respect).</p>

<p>As it stands, a complex morph with many submorphs in it is hard to inspect. The
submorphs of a morph are hidden inside a <code>vector</code> called <code>rawMorphs</code> and there’s
no easy way to display a tree of what submorphs are available in a morph.
Luckily, there is a tool in the Self programming environment that allows us to
easily inspect a submorph and its parents: the <em>core sampler</em>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/core_sampler_idle.png" alt="Core sampler in
the idle state."> <figcaption>
            <p>Core sampler in
the idle state.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The core sampler will list all the morphs under its “magnifying glass” (the
crosshair), starting from the innermost one up to the outermost. Each entry in
the list allows you to see its color, and to see and modify its resizing mode.
You can also middle-click an entry to access the morph’s properties panel and
also get an outliner for the morph.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/core_sampler_list.png" alt="A core sampler
listing the submorphs in an outliner, with their colors (on the left) and their
resize modes (two buttons on the right)."> <figcaption>
            <p>A core sampler
listing the submorphs in an outliner, with their colors (on the left) and their
resize modes (two buttons on the right).</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To access the core sampler, simply right-click any existing morph and select
<code>Core sampler...</code>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/core_sampler_open.png" alt="Opening the core
sampler."> <figcaption>
            <p>Opening the core
sampler.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The core sampler is extremely helpful to figure out why a submorph is
misbehaving, because you can directly see its hierarchy and open an outliner for
it, debugging the morph as it operates. This is one of my favorite parts of
Self, because you interact with the system while it’s running, having all
debugging info at hand.</p>
<p>Now that we looked into Morphic, let’s build something with it.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-application-with-morphic">Building an application with Morphic</h2>
<p>Let’s build a desktop calculator. It’s better than a toy example (because it
actually does something) while being simple enough that this post won’t become
too long (longer than it already is, anyway). The hierarchy of the final
<code>calculatorMorph</code> is presented below.</p>
<pre><code>calculatorMorph
    columnMorph (layout)
        rowMorph (titleBar)
            labelMorph (title)
        uglyTextEditorMorph (editor)
        rowMorph (buttonRows at: 0)
            buttonMorph ('(')
            buttonMorph (')')
            buttonMorph ('CE')
            buttonMorph ('+')
        rowMorph (buttonRows at: 1)
            buttonMorph ('7')
            buttonMorph ('8')
            buttonMorph ('9')
            buttonMorph ('-')
        rowMorph (buttonRows at: 2)
            buttonMorph ('4')
            buttonMorph ('5')
            buttonMorph ('6')
            buttonMorph ('*')
        rowMorph (buttonRows at: 3)
            buttonMorph ('1')
            buttonMorph ('2')
            buttonMorph ('3')
            buttonMorph ('/')
        rowMorph (buttonRows at: 4)
            buttonMorph ('.')
            buttonMorph ('0')
            buttonMorph ('BS')
            buttonMorph ('=')
</code></pre><figure>

</figure>

<p>Let’s start out by copying <code>frameMorph</code>, which provides a rectangular frame
around its contents. Open a shell with <code>New shell...</code> from the background menu,
and type in <code>frameMorph</code> then “Get it” to get the <code>frameMorph</code> prototype.</p>

            <p>The
<code>frameMorph</code> prototype as we saw it earlier.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Earlier we talked about copy-downs and said this is how we create “sub-classes”
of morphs. We will now copy-down <code>frameMorph</code> as the basis of our
<code>calculatorMorph</code>. Middle-click <code>frameMorph</code>’s header and click <code>"Subclass" Me</code>
(this is the easy method of copying down we talked about earlier). When asked
for a copydown selector, leave it as the default and click “Okay”.</p>

            <p>Our
<code>frameMorph</code> “subclass”. Notice the “a” before the name.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can now dismiss the original <code>frameMorph</code> either with right-click &gt;
“Dismiss” or with the <code>X</code> on the top right.</p>
<p>Now that we have the basis for our calculator, we can display it! Middle-click
the header of our newly created morph, and click “Show Morph”. A little blue
square should be attached to the cursor, which we can simply drop to any empty
spot.</p>

&amp;ldquo;calculator&amp;rdquo;."> <figcaption>
            <p>Our
“calculator”.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course, we want it to look like a part of our Morphic system, so let’s pick a
better color for it than blue<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Open the evaluator on our morph’s outliner,
and enter <code>color: paint named: 'lightGray'.</code> and then “Do it”.</p>

<p><code>color:</code> is a message that is provided to us by <code>traits morph</code>. You can evaluate
<code>traits morph</code> in the shell to see what functions are available. Be warned, the
<code>traits morph</code> object is quite large and it can be hard to find a specific thing
you’re looking for, but it is categorized like most other standard library
objects.</p>
<p>Now let’s define a few slots that we will be using (under a new category, so we
don’t get confused later down the line). Above in the …</p></div></div>

		<p>
			Unicode has superscript versions of numerical characters. These are however not
			always rendered correctly (e.g. they are currently broken on MacOSX and iOS
			with the default font). The reason is because the superscript character 1-3
			are defined in separate code blocks from characters 0, 4-9. On Apple products,
			the default font has superscript characters 1-3 but falls back to a different
			font for the other numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			A simple fix would be for Apple to add the other superscript characters to
			the default font (or remove 1-3 and fallback for all superscript characters, but
			that might break software which doesn't implemenent font fallback).
		</p>
		<p>This is a test page. You can compare how your browser renders with the
			default font vs screenshots of what I'm getting.</p>

		<p>Some superscript numbers don't line up:</p>
		<p>Your browser: x⁰, x¹, x², x³, x⁴, x⁵, x⁶, x⁷, x⁸, x⁹.</p>
		<p>Screenshot of mine: <img srcset="https://www.quaxio.com/unicode_superscript1.png 2x" src="https://www.quaxio.com/unicode_superscript1.png"></p>

		<p>As a result, some of the following lines look like x^(ab), others look like x^a^b, and
		others just look broken.</p>
		<p>Your browser:</p>
    <p>x⁰⁰, x⁰¹, x⁰², x⁰³, x⁰⁴, x⁰⁵, x⁰⁶, x⁰⁷, x⁰⁸, x⁰⁹</p>
    <p>x¹⁰, x¹¹, x¹², x¹³, x¹⁴, x¹⁵, x¹⁶, x¹⁷, x¹⁸, x¹⁹</p>
    <p>x²⁰, x²¹, x²², x²³, x²⁴, x²⁵, x²⁶, x²⁷, x²⁸, x²⁹</p>
    <p>x³⁰, x³¹, x³², x³³, x³⁴, x³⁵, x³⁶, x³⁷, x³⁸, x³⁹</p>
    <p>x⁴⁰, x⁴¹, x⁴², x⁴³, x⁴⁴, x⁴⁵, x⁴⁶, x⁴⁷, x⁴⁸, x⁴⁹</p>

        <p>
          You should already know how big tech companies like
          <i>Google</i> or <i>Facebook</i> are using your private data to make
          revenue from targeted ads (and sometimes maybe
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46618582">sell it under the hood</a>
          without your knowledge). There is no secret about
          <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">data being the most valuable asset on earth now</a>
          - even exceeding the oil.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Some people say "I have nothing to hide, I don't care" which is
          essentialy ignoring basic human right and making this right worthless
          to you and very precious to others. We are already living in
          <i>Cyberpunk</i> era and the world is starting to be led by big
          organizations rather than governments so let's try to prepare
          ourselves and start to care about our data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think <i>Google</i> and <i>Facebook</i> are particulary bad when it
          comes to the data - we all heard about <i>Cambridge Analytica</i> and
          lately about <i>Whatsapp scandal</i>. Removing <i>Facebook</i> account
          is slightly easier than moving away from your <i>Google</i> account.
          It's impossible to just toggle some settings and let go your gmail
          address, google search, photos, youtube - pretty much your entire
          digital life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently <i>Google</i> changed their policy for storing photos.
          Starting from July 2021 you won't have unlimited High Quality storage
          as before rather than 15GB limit. This is still okay in terms of space
          but the politics behind it is just disgusting. <i>Google</i> was
          effectively feeding it's photo AI algorithms for face detection and
          tagging for years now using user data obtained by giving up the
          service for free. Now when these algorithms got so good and it's
          almost impossible to make them better and <i>Google</i> don't need
          users anymore they switched to make some money from the service.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To download and backup all your data it's best to use
          <a href="https://takeout.google.com/"><i>Google Takeout</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the intructions and soon you'll get an email with links to your
          data. After you safely obtain it, start clearing your
          <i>Google</i> account.
        </p>

        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Google Photos</i>
            <p>
              To remove all photos and videos you need to go to
              <a href="https://photos.google.com/">photos.google.com</a> and
              remove them from there. This might not be as quick as clicking a
              button.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Youtube, Gmail, Google One</i>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account">Delete services or account</a>
              page and choose what services to remove.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Meet &amp; Calendar</i>
            <p>
              Hard one. People often invite you for online meetings using both
              services. You can't force them to not use those but you can always
              use private browser mode.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Search</i>
            <p>
              Hardest one. Google's core product and definetely the best one on
              the market. You can switch to
              <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> which is okay
              and does the job.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I know it's really hard to remove <i>Youtube</i> and <i>Gmail</i> for
          example. There is no other place than <i>Youtube</i> where all my
          favourite creators are and many people already have my
          <i>Gmail</i> address and contacting me via this one. What I did is
          setup an email forwarding (yes I know Google can still track messages)
          and start using <i>Youtube</i> only via iOS App to avoid auto-logging
          in browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are really hardcore about this you can always go and
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount">Delete account completely</a>
          🤫

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><p>I’ve often heard that writing a compiler is hard, and different than writing other kinds of software.
Some recent experience hsa provided me insight as to why this is the case and proved quite interesting!</p><p>I recently completed work on a new big feature in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a>. I’d been working on it for ~2 months and it ended up being the hardest code that I’d ever written in my life.
I’ve been coding for decades and have worked on so many different projects, and for some very big organisations;
I tell you this for context. When I say this is the hardest code I’ve <em>ever written</em>, it had a lot of competition.
Concurrent systems usually has the reputation of being very difficult and I’ve designed and written a massively concurrent project
from the ground up in my OO days, included writing all the scheduling and concurrency primitives, and managing all the thread-safety myself (those were different times).
I found this piece of work an order of magnitude harder than that.</p><p>I say in the ShipReq <a href="https://blog.shipreq.com/about">About</a> page that <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> is like a compiler.
The big feature that I completed recently was the most compiler-like feature yet, and to my surprise it’s specifically that property that made it so deceptively hard.
What is the feature?
Basically when you have a bunch of requirements / issues / design documents / whatever,
this feature adds automation to populate certain fields according to their relationships and related fields so that
users don’t have to manually edit or maintain it all themselves, which is both tedious and error-prone.
An example would be if someone raises a bug which requires a few dev tasks to fix, one could setup their project so that when all those dev marks are marked as
“complete” the bug itself automatically changes to “ready for testing”.
This feature doesn’t have any knowledge of “completion” or “testing”, but allows users to define whatever states and rules they want.
That might not sound like it relates to writing a compiler.
(It probably doesn’t even sound hard.)
Nor do requirements, bug reports, project documents seem very relatable to code.
But there are surprising similarities. Let’s take a look…</p><h2>Similarity #1: Relationships</h2><p>Nearly all data relationships in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> are many-to-many / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAGs</a>.
Some views in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> present data as flat lists but under-the-hood it’s very rare that anything is stored as a flat list,
and there’s nearly always a way to view the same data as a graph or tree.</p><p>If you squint a bit, source code is kind of like that too.
Packages have multiple classes / objects which have multiple methods / fields / inner classes that have multiple statements that have multiple clauses, etc.
In terms of declaration, it’s more one-to-many than many-to-many but it’s still all a big DAG.
When we start considering relationships like imports and methods calling other methods, then it becomes many-to-many too and we get a cyclic graph.</p><h2>Similarity #2: Interactions</h2><p>Secondly, this new feature in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> is very configurable by users.
It’s a major goal of <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> to avoid hardcoding implicit assumptions and find appropriate and configurable abstractions.
Obviously having users need to reconfigure everything all the time would be a terrible burden so we provide pre-configured
complete setups with best-practices which users can (optionally) use, and can reconfigure without restriction to best serve their needs.
What that means from a coding point of view, is that we never know the automation rules at compile-time.
The code needs to understand and apply all the rules at runtime, and it needs to be able to
recognise and handle data and logic combinations that invalidate invariants. That might not sound like a big deal but there are
many invariants in a complex system and invariants don’t stop at their immediate domain boundary - they propagate
though all relevant graphs and compose, with various levels of complexity, with other invariants.</p><p>For example you may have 10 simple invariants in 10 isolated domains, but when they’re all combined the number of states
to consider becomes 10,000,000,000 and there’s going to be a very significant percentage of those states that you’d consider
illegal (i.e. bugs).</p><p>This too is like writing a compiler.
For example, the Java compiler doesn’t hardcode the privacy level of your classes; it allows you to set it yourself.
Where as <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> might have a UI page for config, in Java you have modifier keywords such that <code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span></code> is different than <code><span>private</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span></code>.
From the perspective of writing a compiler, these are runtime values with runtime rules.
When we consider additional keywords like <code>final</code> and <code>abstract</code> we start getting into what I meant about combinational explosions.
The Java compiler, at runtime, has to ensure all possible combinations are valid. For example, it will reject the following code:</p><div data-language="java"><pre><code><span>final</span> <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>abstract</span> <span>void</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>and</p><div data-language="java"><pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>private</span> <span>abstract</span> <span>void</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Imagine you were writing your own Java compiler.
It’s entirely up to you to think about those illegal combinations and then write the code to catch them.
I think we all take for granted things like marking a method as private and then knowing it’s impossible to
call externally, but under-the-hood that it’s not impossible at all. You’re literally relying on someone’s
<code>if</code> statement in the right place. Just like my <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> example, it’s all value inspection at runtime,
with no guarantees about how all the features will interact. The class/method privacy feature interacting
with <code>final</code> and <code>abstract</code> features is mentally easy enough but every single feature has the ability to
interact badly with something else and it’s not always easy to identify those combinations.</p><p>I recently saw <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a PR to Scala</a> that’s a great
demonstration of exactly this.
The <code>private</code> and <code>sealed</code> keywords have been in Scala forever and someone only <em>just</em> recently
came up with the realisation that private classes are effectively sealed.
Scala’s been in existence for 16 years!
When you have hundreds of features it doesn’t seem feasible to manually consider each possible combination.
100 features yields 4950 unique pairs. There’s nothing special about pairs though, some issues may only
manifest when three specific features intersect. For 100 features there are:</p><ul><li>4950 unique sets of 2</li><li>161,700 unique sets of 3</li><li>3,921,225 unique sets of 4</li><li>…</li><li>17,310,309,456,440 unique sets of 10</li></ul><p>It’s not unlikely to have a bad interaction between 10 features out of a possible 100.
It’s just impossible to manually consider.</p><h2>Similarity #3: Type-Unsafety</h2><p>Type-safety is a pillar that I depend on all the time. And no please don’t think of Java’s type system
when you think type-safety, that’s not really what I mean, although it’s a start.
I mean more the type systems in languages like <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scala</a> and <a href="https://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haskell</a>, think features like existential and dependent types.
Type systems like Java’s and Typescript’s are great! They add value! But you can be an order of magnitude or two
more safe with more advanced type systems and it’s profoundly beneficial when you learn how to make good use of them.</p><p>Unfortunately, type-safety didn’t help me very much when developing my big feature.
Say you’ve got one data location than can accept a set of values. At compile-time, every runtime value is acceptable
because there always exists a configuration that would allow each possible value to be legal.
It’s like having a ‘Name’ field of type <code>String</code>, and then a runtime rule dictating the required first letter of the name.
<em>(Unrealistic but it’s the concept I’m highlighting.)</em>
The configuration might be <code>firstNameLetter<span>:</span> Option<span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span></code>. In such a case you <em>have to</em> have the name field
be something accommodating of all possibilities, like <code>name<span>:</span> <span>String</span></code>.
You could be tricky an create a type that encodes a proof of the name such that it adheres to the rule, but that’s only
a derivation of <code><span>(</span>name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> firstNameLetter<span>:</span> Option<span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code>.
Unless the name and the configuration and atomically modifiable as a single, composite value, you still need to
store both values independently before such a derivation.
The first-letter of a name restriction is a toy example but it demonstrates the fact that you have runtime configuration
in one location, runtime data in the other, and no type-safety at compile-time to enforce that the right thing happens at runtime.</p><p>Compilers have the same problem. They maintain a huge repository of runtime data, and it’s entirely up to the compiler authors
to apply all of the rules, move data in and out of scope depending on other runtime-only conditions, etc, etc.
And unlike us compiler <em>users</em>, they don’t have the benefit of being able to rely on (much of) a type system.
They’re on their own and can only use type safety to guard the bottom layers of their very-complex domain.</p><h2>Similarity #4: Feedback</h2><p>It’s a necessary part of the process that things will go wrong, and users need to be provided meaningful feedback.</p><p>In the case of <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a>, it will…</p><ul><li>detect changes that are always wrong, and prevent the user from making those changes. These are errors.</li><li>detect data/config that has become wrong, modify derivation accordingly, and present them to users in a fully-comprehensible manner. These are warnings.</li><li>collect all info required to explain to users exactly how, why and from where, derived data came to be.
Automatedly populating/amending users’ data is one thing, but I believe users should be able to inspect and understand things like
what steps were performed, and what data were factors.
This is provenance.
It doesn’t sound that hard but in practice it was surprisingly challenging to implement.</li></ul><p>Compilers do the same thing. They…</p><ul><li>detect illegal data and combinations of data at runtime, and explain them to users. Those are errors.</li><li>detect data that is acceptably or potentially wrong, handle them, maybe by ignoring the statement, or modifying the generated code somehow,
and then finally, they flag this to users. These are warnings.</li><li>some compilers calculate how something has come to be and …</li></ul></section></article></div></div>

<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>Here’s the keyboard board without the keys, after being cleaned:</p>

<p>The next picture shows the detail of the key.</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png" alt="Digital VT100 - key exploded view" width="800" height="997" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png 800w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-300x374.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-241x300.png 241w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-624x778.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - teardown" width="1248" height="5816" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-300x1398.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-220x1024.jpg 220w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-624x2908.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png" alt="Digital VT100 - setup" width="1248" height="593" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-300x143.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-1024x487.png 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-624x297.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - back" width="1248" height="858" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-624x429.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>

<p>The power supply unit:</p>

<p>The main processor is an Intel 8080.</p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The side view of the terminal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - side" width="1248" height="866" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362-1024x711.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362-624x433.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>You can immediately recognize the VT100 on the manual cover:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png" alt="Digital VT100 - technical manual" width="312" height="431" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png 624w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-300x414.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px"></a></p>
<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<p>Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Edward Snowden are just 3 of the influential advocates for Signal—a messaging app that’s like WhatsApp, but with more of a focus on privacy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="b34b288" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>And when WhatsApp announced changes to their data-sharing policy, Signal exploded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="3f0d7d8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>But this rapid growth has introduced a UX complexity: the app is now being used by a much broader group of people.</p>

<div data-id="0d4a615" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>Signal <em>may</em> be more private than WhatsApp, but if they ever want to rival their 2 billion users (yes, you read that correctly), then they’ll need a product that’s <strong>just as easy to use</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="7066953" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>The golden question is this: when the hype dies, will people be able to convince their lazy friends, who don’t care about internet privacy, to sign up?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="6777d1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>The answer to that depends on a number of factors, one being how easy the experience of migrating from WhatsApp to Signal is. So let’s take a look.</p>

<p><em>Guest Author</em>: <a href="https://github.com/sreekarsr">Sreekar</a></p>

<p>As part of a course on <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/2019b-EE2025/index.html">Engineering Electromagnetics</a> in the Fall 2019 semester, we had to make a poster on a topic of our interest which involved electromagnetics, which we had to present at our department, on a fine Saturday afternoon (19.10.2019).</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">How did we come up with this topic?<a href="#how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">#</a></h2>

<p>With my exams of the course having gone really bad (I still have nightmares about it :( ), I was determined to make my group’s poster one of the best that will be put up on poster day. The three of us, Sreekar, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nithin-varma-17ba3b174">Nithin Varma</a> and I searched the internet for a topic that was “unconventional” and interesting. After a week or so of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game">following links on Wikipedia</a>, I came across this article - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio)">Whistler (radio)</a>, which caught my eye. It was a topic that most would have not heard about and would be very much interested in learning about it. Bazinga!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sreekar had come up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence">Birefringence</a>, which also seemed interesting. None of us had heard about it before. With these two topics in mind, we asked our instructor, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ee.iitm.ac.in/deepav/">Dr. Deepa Venkitesh</a> for her opinion and she asked us to go with the former.</p>

<p>Before I start explaining the technical details of the poster, do take a look at the poster we made (click on it for a PDF).

<p>In World War I, soldiers used long communication lines to maintain contact with their base. The people on the receiving side of the line, often could hear sounds that were very similar to that of <em>“falling grenades”</em>, when there were none falling. One keen observation was that this particular sound was heard during the times of lightning strikes.</p>

<p>Here’s a short sound clip of what they heard:</p>

<p>The first one, in which you would have noticed a tone of descending frequency, is called a <strong>Whistler</strong>, while the second, which consists of rising and falling tones of frequency is a <strong>Chorus</strong>. This post will talk more on whistlers as they are more extensively studied among the two.</p>

<p><strong>Whistlers</strong> are Very Low Frequency (VLF) emissions in the atmosphere that are characterised by a <em>tone of rapidly descending frequencies</em>.</p>

<p>Being long-wavelength (~ 100 km!!) <em>EM Waves</em>, it’s understandable that they couple into communication lines that are as long as 100 km. This explains the strange noises heard by soldiers in WWI.</p>

<h3 id="sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">Sources and generation of whistlers<a href="#sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>A natural question to ask is how these waves are generated in the first place. The literature on this is limited, but there is considerable evidence to say that the source of whistlers must be not very different from lightning.</p>

<p>The only known characteristic of whistlers that distinguishes it from ordinary lightning is their relatively high energy content. After accounting for attenuation losses, the estimated electromagnetic energy in a whistler producing stroke is about ten times as great as that in the average lightning flash. A sufficiently strong lightning flash should be able to produce whistler-mode signals.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing - we also detect these waves at locations where there may be no lightning at all. In fact, these waves can also be detected at places whose <em>magnetically conjugate point</em> has experienced a lightning strike. That means that there must be some <em>mode of propagation</em> that is making this possible. The theory behind it’s propagation can be intuitively understood using the basic concepts of a waveguide.</p>

<h3 id="waveguides">Waveguides<a href="#waveguides">#</a></h3>

<p>To the uninitiated, here’s the wikipedia definition of a waveguide:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A waveguide is a structure that guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or sound, with minimal loss of energy by restricting expansion to one dimension or two. Without the physical constraint of a waveguide, wave amplitudes decrease according to the inverse square law as they expand into three dimensional space.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- pic of waveguide -->

<p>It literally is in the name - It “guides” waves, sort of like a tunnel (over-simplified). One very popular waveguide is the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_Fibre">optical fibre</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest idealised case of a waveguide is a <em>parallel plate waveguide</em>, in which the wave is constrained between <em>two conductors</em>. Solving Maxwell’s equations and applying boundary conditions will give us a solution which has a wave that propagates in a direction tangential to the plates.</p>

<p>Now, consider the earth and the ionosphere. The earth is a good conductor, in the sense that at the frequencies we are talking about (KHz), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_loss#Loss_tangent">loss tangent</a>, is about 600.</p>

<p>The ionosphere, as its name suggests, has a lot of ions, making it a good conductor as well. What we now have is a waveguide through which EM waves, more specifically VLF waves, can be guided through.</p>

<h3 id="propagation-of-whistlers">Propagation of Whistlers<a href="#propagation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>Energy from a lightning source near the earth’s surface travels in the earth-ionosphere waveguide and enters the ionosphere continuously along the lower surface of the ionosphere. Wave components that enter the ionosphere at the location of a duct are then trapped and “conveyed” to the opposite hemisphere along the same magnetic line of force, which are aligned exactly along the duct, where they emerge from the ionosphere and re-enter the earth-ionosphere waveguide.</p>

<p>So…, a bunch of frequencies is generated by a lightning strike at a location, <em>at the same time</em>. All of them take the same path and reach another location. So, ideally we should be receiving all the frequencies at the same time. But we hear a tone of descending frequency. <strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>The reason lies in the ionosphere. The velocity of propagation of a wave through the ionosphere is dependent on it’s frequency. This leads to a dispersion of waves, with each frequency traveling at a different speed.</p>

<p>Graph of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}$ vs $t$ (time of arrival)</p>
<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>Due to the dispersion of waves in the ionosphere depending on their frequencies, different frequencies are received at different times, with the higher frequencies being received first, as seen from the above graph. This is why a whistler is a tone of descending frequency.</p>

<p>The theory’s great. But how do we practically detect and hear these sounds?</p>

<p>Since these are electromagnetic waves, we have to first “capture” these EM waves, then transduce them, i.e. convert them to audio to actually hear the audio clips you heard before.</p>

<p>The wavelength of these waves are extremely huge (100 km for a 3KHz wave). This means that it is not possible to have a <a href="http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/dipole.php">full-wavelength antenna</a>, for capturing the wave accurately. A typical VLF receiver is about 60ft long - there is very little signal current for reception. Using a cascaded combination of high gain, high input impedance (for better sensitivity) amplifiers and low pass filters, we can make up for the difference.</p>

<p>What’s a <em>spectrogram</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically it is a graph, with x-axis as time (usually), y-axis as frequency and the intensity/amplitude at a point $(f, t)$ is given by it’s color.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201.jpg">

<p>Source: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio</a>)</i></p>

<p>This is a real-life spectrogram of a whistler. At around <strong>0355:29</strong>, you can a see a band of frequencies being generated. This is called a <em>tweek</em>.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201-mark-tweek.jpg">
</p><p>Tweek in a spectrogram</p>

<p>At near <strong>0355:31</strong>, you see that the “tone of descending frequencies” has started. Notice how there’s a time delay between the tweek and the start of the whistler. This tells us that it is detected elsewhere (remember the magnetically conjugate point?), meaning it has travelled (or the whistler has been detected at the same place as the tweek.)</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Helliwell">Robert A. Helliwell</a>, in his book <em>Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena</em>, the idealised spectrogram for a whistler is:
<img title="ideal-spectrogram" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202.png"></p>

<p>Ideal whistler spectrograms</p>
<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>There’s a lot more in the above diagram than just ideal spectrograms. The figure shows us a wealth of information.</p>

<p>If you look closely, we can see the ideal spectrogram containing all the “<em>reflections</em>” of the whistler.</p>

<p><strong>Hold On!</strong> Where did reflections come from?
Well, as I had mentioned that it propagates, I had mentioned that the tweek generated would travel into an ionospheric duct, then come back into the earth-ionosphere waveguide. Well, EM waves, in fact any wave, simply don’t do nothing when they travel from one medium to another.</p>

<p>Because of the change in refractive indices of the media, some of the energy carried by the waves will be reflected into the first medium, and the rest will be transmitted into the second (there’s also absorption of energy, but I’m ignoring that as it is very less compared to the other two).</p>

<p>In this part of the above figure,
<img title="box1" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box1.png">
we can see the tweek, and also a number of whistlers, each dragged out more than the previous. Such whistlers are detected at the same place of origin of the tweek. They are called as <em><strong>Odd-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, since they have “hopped” or “jumped” (i.e. reflected) an odd number of times.</p>

<p><em>Why are they getting dragged out more?</em> Because, each undergoes a greater amount of dispersion than the previous as they travel a lot more distance after each reflection before detecting them.</p>

<p>Similarly, in this part of the figure,
<img title="box2" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box2.png">
we can see all the <em><strong>Even-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, and these are detected at the magnetically conjugate point to the point of origin of the tweek.</p>

<p>I had mentioned that the waves get dispersed in the ionosphere, right? Well, later studies showed that according to dispersion theory, every whistler should have a characteristic frequency (not necessarily the maximum frequency detected), that has the minimum time delay. This frequency is called <em>the nose …</em></p></article></div>

<p>Björn Ottosson recenty published a blog post introducing <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>. The blog claimed that Oklab is a better perceptual color space than what came before. It piqued my interest, and I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>In exploring perceptual color spaces, I find an interactive gradient tool to be invaluable, so I’ve reproduced one here:</p>





<!--Jerry-rigged color picker-->




<h2 id="why-and-when-a-perceptual-color-space">Why (and when) a perceptual color space?</h2>

<p>Most image processing is done using a device color space (most often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>), and most libraries and interfaces expose that color space. Even when an image editing tool or a standard (such as CSS) exposes other color spaces, it’s still most common to use the device color space. But for some use cases, a perceptual color space can give better results.</p>

<p>Basically <em>the</em> central question of color theory is how colors (in the physical sense) are perceived. The trichromacy assumption basically groups colors into equivalence classes in a three-dimensional space, and display devices generally produce colors by mixing three additive primaries: the familiar red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>In an ideal perceptual color space, the distance of two points in the space would correlate strongly with the <em>perception</em> of color difference. Put another way, all pairs separated by a “just noticeable difference” would be separated by an equal distance.</p>

<p>As it turns out, such a thing is no more possible than flattening an orange peel, because color perception is inherently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900785_Non-Euclidean_Structure_of_Spectral_Color_Space">non-Euclidean</a>. To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Even so, like map projections, it is possible to make a color space that approximates perceptual uniformity and is useful for various tasks. One of these, a primary focus of this blog post, is smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Gradients are of course very similar to color scales, and a good perceptual color space can be used as the basis for those. An even better approach is to use a real color appearance model, as was done in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>, and is well explained and motivated in that video (it contains a brief introduction to color science as well).</p>

<p>A major application of perceptual color spaces is image manipulation, especially changing the color saturation of an image. This is a particular place where hue uniformity is important, as you don’t want hues to shift. Also, prediction of lightness is especially important when transforming a color image to black and white.</p>

<p>Perceptual color spaces are also a good basis for programmatic manipulation of color palettes, for example to create sets of colors in particular relation to each other, or to derive one of dark and light mode from the other. For example, the normal/hover/active/disabled states of a button may be different lightness and saturation values of the same hue, so hue shift would be undesirable. In particular, I think a future evolution of the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Blend modes</a> should have at least the option to do the blending in a high quality perceptual color space.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned by Björn, a color picker widget can benefit from a good perceptual space. It should be possible to adjust lightness and saturation without affecting hue, in particular.</p>

<p>Much of the literature on perceptual color spaces is geared to image compression, with two primary motivations. First, as compression adds errors, you generally want those errors distributed evenly in perceptual space; it wouldn’t be good at all to have artifacts that appear more prominently in areas of a particular shade. Second, good compression depends on a clean separation of lightness and chroma information, as the latter can be compressed better.</p>

<p>All that said, there are definitely cases where you do <em>not</em> want to use a perceptual space. Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-gradients">Focus on gradients</h2>

<p>This blog post will use gradients as the primary lens to study perceptual color spaces. They are a very sensitive instrument for certain flaws (especially lack of hue uniformity), and a useful goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-true-gamma">No one true gamma</h2>

<p>The transfer function for neutral colors is the literal backbone of any color space. Commonly referred to as “gamma,” it is one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in computer graphics. <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a> is a definitive account, and I refer the interested reader there, but will try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>An ideal transfer function for gradients will have perceptually equal steps from black to white. In <em>general,</em> the transfer function in CIELAB is considered close to perceptually uniform, but as always in color perception, the truth is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, perception depends on viewing conditions. That includes the ambient light, but also the surround; the same gradient surrounded by white will appear darker than when surrounded by black. For an extremely compelling demonstration of the power of surround to affect the perception of lightness, see <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi’s illusion pages</a>, for example <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/light2e.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Another complication is that the light received by the eye includes so-called “veiling glare,” a fraction of ambient light reflected by the monitor because its black is not a perfect absorber (veiling glare is much less of a problem in movie-like conditions).</p>

<p>The actual CIELAB transfer function is not a perfect cube-root rule, but rather contains a linear segment in the near-black region (the sRGB transfer function is similar but has different parameters). This segment increases perceptual uniformity of ramps in the presence of veiling glare, and also makes the transform robustly invertible using lookup tables.</p>

<p>There is good science on how perception varies with viewing conditions, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM</a> color appearance model has parameters that can fine-tune it when these are known. But in practice, viewing conditions are not known, and the best approach is to adopt a best guess or compromise.</p>

<h3 id="hdr">HDR</h3>

<p>HDR is a different story, and I need to go into it to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp">ICtCp</a> color space.</p>

<p>In standard dynamic range, you basically assume the visual system is adapted to a particular set of viewing conditions (in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> specifies an exact set of viewing conditions, including monitor brightness, white point, and room lighting). A perceptually uniform gradient from black to white is also useful for image coding, because if you set number of steps so that each individual step is <em>just</em> imperceptible, it uses a minimum number of bits for each sample while faithfully rendering the image without artifacts. And in sRGB, 256 level is just barely enough for most uses, though steps are often visible when displaying gradients, the case where the eye is most sensitive to quantization errors.</p>

<p>In HDR, however, this approach doesn’t quite work. Because of the wider range of brightness values from the display device, and also weaker assumptions about the viewing conditions (darkened rooms are common for movie viewing), the human visual system might at any time be adapted to quite light or quite dark viewing conditions. In the latter case, it would be sensitive to much finer gradations in near-black shades than when adapted to lighter conditions, and a similar situation is true the other way around. If tuned for any one single brightness level, results will be good when adaptation matches, but poor otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, HDR uses a different approach. It uses a model (known as the Barten model, and shown in Figure 4.6 of <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a>) of the minimum contrast step perceptible at each brightness level, over all possible adaptation conditions. The goal is to determine a sequence of steps so that each step is just under the threshold of what’s perceptible under <em>any</em> viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The SMPTE ST 2084 transfer function is basically a mathematical curve-fit to the empirical Barten model, and has the property that with 12 bits of code words, each step is just under 0.9 of the minimum perceptual difference as predicted by the Barten model, across a range from 0.001 to 10,000 nits of brightness (7 orders of magnitude). There’s lots more detail and context in the presentation <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/smpte-2014-05-06-eotf-miller-1-2-handout-pdf.1347114/">A Perceptual EOTF for Extended
Dynamic Range Imagery</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That said, though it’s sophisticated and an excellent fit to the empirical Barten curve, it is <em>not</em> perceptually uniform at any one particular viewing condition. In particular, a ramp of the ST 2084 curve will dwell far too long near-black (representing a range that would be more visible in dark viewing conditions). To see this for yourself, try the black+white button in the interactive explorer above.</p>

<h3 id="a-comparison-of-curves">A comparison of curves</h3>

<p>We can basically place curves on a scale from “way too dark” (ST 2084) to “way too light” (linear light), with all the others in between. CIELAB is a pretty good median (though this may express my personal preference), with IPT a bit lighter and Oklab a bit darker.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/colorspace_transfer_functions.png" width="575"></p>

<p>I found Björn’s arguments in favor of pure cube root to be not entirely compelling, but this is perhaps an open question. Both CIELAB and sRGB use a finite-derivative region near black. Is it important to limit derivatives for more accurate LUT-based calculation? Perhaps in 2021, we will almost always prefer ALU to LUT. The conditional part is also not ideal, especially on GPUs, where branches can hurt performance. I personally would explore transfer functions of the form $f(x) = a + (b + cx)^\gamma$, constrained so $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, as these are GPU-friendly and have smooth derivatives. The XYB color space used in JPEG XL apparently uses a bias rather than a piecewise linear region, as well.

<p>The foundation of a CNC router is some sort of rigid frame. On top of the frame you attach linear guides which allow your axes to move. You actuate that movement with belts or screws, whose rotation is powered by motors. Those motors are controlled by a pulse generator attached to a gcode intepreter, which gets its commands from a gcode sender. I'll cover all your major options below.</p>
<hr>

<p>The frame is the main body of your machine. You should use the most rigid material you are able to work with.</p>
<h2 id="wood">Wood</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/wooden_frame.jpg" alt="Wooden Frame Router" title="Example Wooden Frame Router"></p>
<p>If you only have access to woodworking equipment, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjdXpp77MdU">wood is your only choice</a>. The main advantages of wood are that it is cheap and easy to work with. The main disadvantage is that wood is not rigid enough to resist cutting forces, leading to chatter and low-quality surface finishes. A secondary concern is that wood is very dimensionally unstable, easily fluctuating with temperature and humidity changes.</p>
<p>If you never intend to cut any material harder than wood and you are comfortable never achieving tight tolerances or repeatable dimensions, a wooden frame can be a very economical choice. If you are primarily making art pieces rather than functional mechanical parts subject to tolerances, this might be a good choice for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/mpcnc.jpg" alt="Mostly Printed CNC" title="The Mostly Printed CNC"></p>
<p>The Mostly Printed CNC and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs0FU6PfPg">others</a> like it make use of cheap extruded metal tube to serve as bones and 3D printed parts to serve as joints. Many of these designs don't require metalworking skills of any kind except to cut metal tubes to length. Given the ubiquity of 3D printers nowadays, these designs are extremely accessible, maybe moreso than wooden designs.</p>
<p>Their primary weakness is that 3D printed parts aren't very rigid, so the precision, repeatability, and surface finish of parts created on these machines is limited. Another common weakness in these designs is to use the extruded metal surface as the linear guide. Extruded metal is not a precision surface so any surface imperfections in the metal will translate to imperfections in the finished work. This limits the usefulness to hobby and art projects.</p>
<p>I should mention that "low-precision" for a CNC router might mean give or take 30 thousandths of an inch. If you are a woodworker used to table saws and pencil-drawn lines, tolerances that tight are fantastic and either a wooden frame or mostly printed frame will likely exceed your needs.</p>
<h2 id="extruded-aluminum-aka-8020">Extruded Aluminum aka 8020</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/avidcnc.jpg" alt="Avid CNC" title="Avid CNC"></p>
<p>A very popular choice for router frames is aluminum 8020. The extruded profiles can be ordered in many dimensions and some providers like <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501010000/?searchFlow=results2category&amp;KWSearch=Aluminum%20extrusions">Misumi</a> will not only cut them to length for you, they will drill and countersink holes, they will tap ends, and perform many other operations for you right in their factory.</p>
<p>The ease of working with 8020 cannot be overstated. If you have a miter saw you can easily cut it to length yourself to produce whatever design you like. The main advantages are that you get the rigidity of metal-on-metal joints and the infinite reworkability of a lego set without the difficulty of more traditional metalworking.</p>
<p>Some providers can even mill precision surfaces onto your extrusion, allowing it to play double duty as a structural member and a linear guide.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of 8020 are that it is more costly than extruded aluminum tube and that it isn't as rigid as steel. Still, it is a very popular choice because it is the cheapest, easiest way to produce a machine capable of hitting tolerances and producing great surface finishes.</p>
<h2 id="steel-beams">Steel Beams</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/steel_frame_router.jpg" alt="Steel Frame Router" title="Steel Frame Router"></p>
<p>A Steel frame is a fantastic choice for its high mass and high rigidity. The biggest downsides are that metalworking requires tools that many hobbyists don't have access to, and that steel frames do not damp vibration well.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable cutting, welding, and powder coating steel then you should probably go ahead and build the frame out of steel. Some large surfaces will need to be milled flat to hold linear guides, so make sure you plan everything out before you start welding.</p>
<p>With a steel frame you can hit tight tolerances and cut almost any material. Your machine's primary limitation won't be its frame. See This Old Tony's excellent steel-framed CNC router build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9UA9ZRFwWU">here</a></p>
<h2 id="cast-iron">Cast Iron</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/cast_iron.jpg" alt="Cast Iron Frame" title="A CNC machine with cast iron frame"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes very often have frames made of cast iron for its superior vibration damping, extreme rigidity, and reduced part count by combining many parts together into a single casting.</p>
<p>This technique requires a tremendous amount of pre-planning, experience, and access to a metal foundry. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult for most hobbyists, but it produces some of the finest CNC machines that can be produced.</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are that cast iron parts can easily rust in open air or corrode if attacked with solvents. Cast parts generally need to be sand blasted and painted to survive industrial environments.</p>
<p>The casting process does not leave you with precision surfaces, so surface machining will be required on any parts that must be within a specified tolerance.</p>
<p>There is significant upfront engineering cost to produce the required molds, but once you have molds the per-unit cost of casting can be cost competitive. If you are designing an extremely high quality CNC router specifically to be mass produced and sold to others, consider cast iron for your frame.</p>
<h2 id="epoxy-granite">Epoxy Granite</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/epoxy_granite.webp" alt="Epoxy Granite Frame" title="A CNC machine with epoxy granite frame"></p>
<p>An exotic choice for frame building is epoxy granite--crushed up natural granite suspended in an epoxy binder that you cast into whatever shape you want, at room temperature.</p>
<p>The advantages of epoxy granite are that it is very dimensionally stable, it is resistent to chemical solvents, it does not require painting, and it can damp vibrations up to 30 times better than an equivalent steel frame, or 10 times better than cast iron. Epoxy granite can be cast into any shape you like using only at-home equipment and techniques. Pre-made threaded inserts and linear guides can be inserted at casting time, greatly reducing the need for machine finishing the final cast parts. For ultra high precision builds, epoxy granite is a fantastic choice.</p>
<p>The disdvantages are that epoxy granite has low tensile strength, and generally needs to be quite thick in all parts of the frame.</p>
<p>Epoxy granite is a rare choice among hobbyists, but I believe it is mostly because the design and build process are so foreign. Frames made from steel beams are easy to visualize and intuitive to link together. Frames made from cast material require a very different design approach that is just not well understood by most hobbyists.</p>
<p>If you are really looking to build an incredibly high performance machine, especially if you plan to make many machines, epoxy granite might be a good choice for you.</p>
<hr>

<p>The role of the linear guide is to constrain movement onto a single axis, preventing any unwanted rotation or deflection. These are often some of the most expensive parts on a CNC router.</p>
<h2 id="box-ways-or-dovetail-ways">Box Ways or Dovetail Ways</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/dovetail_ways.jpg" alt="Dovetail Ways" title="Dovetail ways"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes generally use box ways or dovetail ways, which are precision machined surfaces floating over each other on a microscopically thin film of oil, kept tight with a small insert called a gibbs. When kept clean of damaging debris and maintained properly with oil, ways <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdoUjynpEk&amp;t=125">do not wear whatsoever</a> and will last longer than every other part of the machine.</p>
<p>Ways have the advantage of a huge contact area, allowing vibrations to couple very effectively across the linear guide and into the frame. This allows vibrational energy to spread out through the entire machine body where it can be dampened effectively.</p>
<p>They carry the secondary advantage of being extremely massive, which helps reduce the amplitude of vibrations. Ways are the most rigid linear guides available. In mills or lathes the ways can be ground directly into the body of the machine, reducing assembly complexity and part count.</p>
<p>Despite all these advantages they are almost never incorporated into CNC routers because they are too expensive per unit length, their large mass makes them unweildy, and their wear patterns are not a good match for computer controlled machining.</p>
<p>The issue with wear is that if a small problem does develop on the ways, it can quickly cascade into a serious issue that causes further damage. Repairing ways, especially in situ, is a tremendously tedious and therefore expensive process. A human machinist is likely to notice such problems developing on a manual mill, but the computer operating a CNC mill will not notice.</p>
<p>In contrast all following linear guides are cheap and easy to replace when worn.</p>
<h2 id="supported-shafts">Supported Shafts</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/supported_shafts.jpg" alt="Supported Shaft linear guides" title="Supported Shafts"></p>
<p>Supported shafts are precision ground steel with aluminum support structure underneath that allows you to fix the shaft firmly to the frame of the CNC machine. The linear bearings that run on the shaft are free to rotate about 20 degrees back and forth on the long axis of the shaft, meaning they actually offer two distinct degrees of freedom, one of which must be further …</p></div></div>

			<h2>What is Colorize?</h2>
			<p>Colorize is a website that turns any word or phrase into a hex color.  It works by using a search engine to find image results for the word or phrase, and then finding the average color across the approximately 25 image results.  Because of this, there's usually a small delay when a word is searched for the first time.</p>

			<h2>What would I use it for?</h2>
			<p>If you've ever been drawing in Photoshop and thought 'What color is the sky', or have been designing a website and looking for that perfect 'purple' color, or just wanted to know what color sand is, Colorize is the tool for you.</p>
