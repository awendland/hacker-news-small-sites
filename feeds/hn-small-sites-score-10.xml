<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>After our team successfully <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/T8012#Bootrom_Exploits">ported</a> the <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit">checkm8</a> exploit to the AppleSilicon T2 chip, we began exploring methods for closed-case hardware debugging, or CCD, as found on other iDevices. On such devices, the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/debug-visibility-and-trace/coresight-architecture/serial-wire-debug">Serial Wire Debug</a> protocol can be muxed out across the Lightning connector, which we presumed was replicable across the USB Type-C connector. With some assistance from easily obtainable schematics for our MacBook models, we have determined that muxing is handled by an Apple/TI co-designed <a href="https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-port-controller-interface-specification">USB Type-C Port Controller</a>, colloquially known as "ACE". The following details our findings and the vendor defined protocol, termed AppleVDM, Apple has implemented over the USB Power Delivery standard for muxing out various internal peripherals.</p><p>A member of our team, @h0m3us3r has dumped the ACE firmware by attaching a SWD probe onto exposed test points on the logic board of a MacBook Pro. Thanks to this we were able to obtain both the ROM and the firmware payload patch applied over it and discover that the ACE chip contains a <code><a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0">Cortex-M0 r0p1</a></code> ARM core. Most of the static analysis was later conducted by @mrarm.</p><pre><code>Connecting to target via SWD

<center>Segger J-Link Probe output when attached to ACE2 (CD3217).</center><h2 id="ace-overview">ACE Overview</h2><p>To better understand the inner-workings of ACE, we began looking for identifying information within the dumped firmware. We found the string <code>CD3217 &nbsp; HW0022 FW002.032.00 ZACE2-J213</code> and upon searching <code>CD3217</code> online resulted in the similar <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65986.pdf">TI TPS65986</a>. Based on how similar the functional description of the aforementioned TI USB Type-C Controller is to ACE, and considering that TI co-designed ACE with Apple, it was reasonable to assume most of the technical information applies to ACE.</p><p>TI's USB Type-C Controllers expose an I²C interface for host management, for which we found the excellent <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slvuan1a/slvuan1a.pdf">Host Interface Technical Reference Manual</a>, documenting a multitude of public I²C registers and commands.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image.png 1000w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TPS65986 Functional Block Diagram</figcaption></figure><p>The primary component of focus based on the above block diagram is the digital core, which communicates directly with the host and runs the firmware we dumped previously. As mentioned, the core is based on a <code>Cortex-M0 r0p1</code>. Unfortunately, we were unable to create a complete memory map with peripherals as TI does not release public information on the core itself. Regardless, we have the basic memory layout as follows:</p><p>Since we weren't sure whether the code for muxing out things lives in the ACE or somewhere else (there are registers for receiving vendor messages and processing them on another chip), we also investigated the firmware of chips that can directly communicate with the ACE, the SMC, part of T2 SoC, and the Thunderbolt controller. While we obtained and analyzed the I2C usages in the SMC firmware and found no suspicious code whatsoever, we had issues with analyzing the Thunderbolt controller firmware and decided to only reverse engineer it as a last resort. We initially thought that the only way that we could talk with the ACE from Mac OS (Intel) was by modifying the SMC firmware to relay commands to the ACE. While we have successfully managed to edit the SMC firmware and talk with the ACE, it turned out that this effort wasn't needed. Later we stumbled upon the following project: <a href="https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher">https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher</a>, which uses the AppleHPM kext in order to communicate with the ACE.</p><p>The AppleHPM KEXT allows a user space program running as root to read and write ACE registers. It also has several interesting methods that seem to be intended for reading and writing registers on ACEs connected using a USB Type-C cable to the DUT. Unfortunately, while we tried invoking them, we didn't manage to get these methods working, suggesting that either they have been disabled on production hardware or need some more preparation work in order to work. We also discovered that there exists an EFI mode firmware updater for the ACE called <code>HPMUtil.efi</code>, which we also partially reverse engineered. There seems to be several methods of updating the ACEs depending on the hardware revision; the EFI program also seems to have an argument that makes it update externally connected ACEs, however at least for recent ACEs it seems to be broken; the only update route that would work on the firmware dump we obtained from our Mac (based on available commands) seems to be hardcoded in a few places to run commands on the local ACE.</p><p>There are at least 3 known revisions of the ACE chip. Based on hardware available to us, the first variant, ACE1, is known to be used in 2018 and older T2 models, the second, ACE2, in 2019 and newer T2 models, and the third in 2020 M1 enabled laptops. The software update method differs significantly between ACE1 and ACE2. At the time of writing the article, we have only successfully dumped a single ACE firmware (ACE2) and all the analysis here is based on that version.</p><h2 id="usb-pd">USB PD</h2><p>The logical channel for telling the Mac to mux out something other than USB from the chip would be USB PD, since ACE's main communication vector with external devices is USB PD and because controlling data lines using USB PD is a widespread practice (see: MIPI debug interface as well as this article on getting UART off an Samsung phone: <a href="https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf">https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf</a>). This TI-derived controller can be configured to support some variant of MIPI debug mode by default (and the MIPI debug ID is present in the Apple ACE firmware as well), however as we discovered later it is disabled in Apple's configuration and can not be used. As such, we decided to look for other Vendor Defined Messages that the ACE understands.</p><p>In the USB PD protocol, entering a vendor mode begins by sending a SVID (Standard ID or Vendor ID, usually the vendor's USB VID) and object position (think of it as a sub mode that the vendor can define). By analyzing the ACE firmware we found at least 3 possible object positions under the Apple SVID, however their availability is dynamic and by default only a single SVID and object position is available. This primary mode is, for example, used when the Apple's charger is connected. We are not sure when the other modes are activated and plan to do further work related to figuring out what the purpose of these other modes is.</p><p>Since it would be logical if there was a reply for the command for entering a mode and also because reverse engineering an embedded firmware with no context whatsoever is hard, we decided to look into the <code>VDMs</code> command, which can be used to send a VDM PD message. This allowed us to gather important information about the firmware's inner workings and also to find a few functions that sent a message with Apple's vendor ID. We investigated several of these, some of them were indeed related to the protocol used with the charger (which we aren't sure what the purpose of is; however from what it seems it can be only used to read some memory sections from the external device), but we also found another procedure that had three cases, two of which replied with 16-bit values (created from information from a particular memory area) in a similar way to the Discover SVIDs VDM, and one of them was complex and handled additional logic. We investigated it further and eventually managed to use it to mux things out of the controller.</p><p>Another possible use of the <code>VDMs</code> command can be found in the AppleHPM KEXT and the <code>HPLUtil.efi</code> program, which is reading registers from externally connected devices. Since we haven't given much attention to it as it was not our goal and our experiments were a failure, we are not going to describe it in this article.</p><p>Note that since SWD can also be muxed from the ACE, further reverse engineering ACE modes is not that interesting; you should be able to use the ACE's SWD to trigger any mux choice of your choosing and directly talk to all peripherals ACE has access to.</p><h2 id="dive-into-the-code">Dive into the code</h2><p>With @h0m3us3r's dump of ROM and RAM memory, we started by loading the ACE firmware in IDA. The reset handler address is present at <code>0x00000004</code> and can be used to get the address of the entrypoint.</p><p>The command table can be trivially found by looking for the 4 character codes. Register table requires a bit more effort but is also not hard to find (since there is a register that is a string, you can find what references it). In comparison to the public TI documentation, there are substantially more commands and registers available, some of which are Apple-specific additions. Since the firmware has barely any strings or debug information, the command list has been very helpful.</p><p>After initially exploring the firmware we quickly stumbled upon cursed looking trampolines such as the following:</p><pre><code>ROM:000266C2 _Command_HRST                           ; DATA XREF: ROM:commandsâ†“o

In Scenario A as you make more money you allow your expenses to increase by 4% per year. In Scenario B as you make more money you allow your expenses to increase by only 1% per year. By allowing your costs to inflate by 3% less, the result is you end up with $1.5M additional in the bank by age 65 (and this is assuming you aren't investing any of these savings over the years).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->

        <p>
          Did you ever wonder how 3D engines render objects on the screen? Or how graphics APIs such as OpenGL or DirectX are written? This course is a complete immersion on how CPU-based 3D engines work. We will use C to develop a complete 3D engine from scratch, pixel by pixel, triangle per triangle. This is a basic course that requires no prior knowledge, but you will probably make the most of it if you know already the basics of programming.

        <p>
          This course is a complete journey into the world of 3D rendering. We will learn how to represent and display 3D objects without any graphics API. No OpenGL. No DirectX. No GPU. Just you, your C compiler, a smoking processor, and an array of pixel colors willing to dance 90's style. You will learn how to draw pixels, rasterize lines, triangles, complex 3D models, and understand the theory and the math behind computer graphics programming. If you want to understand how computer graphics really work, join us now!

                  <p>Been waiting for a course like this for years.  A lot of the theory of 3d graphics is availablein books and online , but none that put it into practice in such a clear way (if at all) . Also using C which I am more comfortable using than OOP (i'm a bit old school) .  It is a great refresher on C too, its a big project so far (only a bout 1/3 of the way through), but loving it so far.  </p>

                  <p>This course going into details which are usually if not always omitted by other courses in this category. I liked that the math and actual algorithms were discussed before implementing them and student own problem solving opportunity was encouraged throughout. This course has enabled me to fill in the critical gaps in some of the most important fundamental concepts in 3d graphics programming. Hope to see more!! Thank you.</p>

I bought it because I want to support those kind of materials! I basically learned all this stuff by myself through books and articles, but this course is a all in one place to learn them all at once, in a fun/approachable and motivating way that will make you save some precious time. Even if this is a good refresher for me and I already had the "clicks" before, I'll recommend it for anyone wanting to become a graphics/game/programmer !</p>

<h3 id="keyword-arguments-are-now-fully-separated-from-positional-arguments">Keyword arguments are now fully separated from positional arguments<a href="#keyword-arguments-are-now-fully-separated-from-positional-arguments"></a></h3>

<p>The separation which <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes">started in 2.7</a> with deprecations, is now fully finished. It means  keyword arguments are not a “syntax sugar” on top of hashes, and they never converted into each other implicitly:</p>

<h3 id="arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments">Arguments forwarding (<code>...</code>) supports leading arguments<a href="#arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments"></a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Argument forwarding, when <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes">introduced in 2.7</a>, was able to forward only all-or-nothing. It turned out to be not enough. One of the important usages for leading arguments are cases like <code>method_missing</code> and other DSL-defined methods that need to pass to the nested method <code>:some_symbol</code> + all of the original arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16378">Feature #16378</a></li>
  <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/doc/syntax/methods_rdoc.html#label-Argument+forwarding"><code>doc/syntax/methods.rdoc</code></a> <em><small>(the link is to a <code>master</code> version, docs were merged post 3.0 release)</small></em></li>
  <li><strong>Code:</strong>
    <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>request</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>headers: </span><span>{})</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>#{</span><span>method</span><span>.</span><span>upcase</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>#{</span><span>url</span><span>}</span><span> (headers=</span><span>#{</span><span>headers</span><span>}</span><span>)"</span>

<span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'https://example.com'</span><span>,</span> <span>headers: </span><span>{</span><span>content_type: </span><span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
<span># GET https://example.com (headers={:content_type=&gt;"json"})</span>

<span># Leading arguments may be present both in the call and in the definition:</span>
<span>def</span> <span>logged_get</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>message</span>

</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Notes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>“all arguments splat” <code>...</code> should be the last statement in the argument list (both on a declaration and a call)</li>
      <li>on a method declaration, arguments before <code>...</code> can only be positional (not keyword) arguments, and can’t have default values (it would be <code>SyntaxError</code>);</li>
      <li>on a method call, arguments passed before <code>...</code> can’t be keyword arguments (it would be <code>SyntaxError</code>);</li>
      <li>make sure to check your punctuation thoroughly, because <code>anything ...</code> is a syntax for endless range, those constructs are valid syntax, but would do not what is expected:
        <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>delegates</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>

<h3 id="endless-method-definition">“Endless” method definition<a href="#endless-method-definition"></a></h3>

<p>Methods of exactly one statement now can be defined with syntax <code>def method() = statement</code>. (The syntax doesn’t need <code>end</code>, hence the “endless definition” moniker.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Ruby’s <code>end</code>s (unlike C-like languages’ <code>{}</code>) are generally OK for Rubyists, but make small utility methods look more heavy than they should. For small utility methods with body containing just one short statement like:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>available?</span>
  <span>!</span><span>@internal</span><span>.</span><span>empty?</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>…the “proper” definition might look so heavy that one will decide against it to leave the class more readable (and instead make class’ clients to just do <code>obj.internal.empty?</code> themselves, making it less semantical). For such cases, a shortcut one-line definition may change the perceiving of utility method creation:</p>
    <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>available?</span> <span>=</span> <span>!</span><span>@internal</span><span>.</span><span>any?</span>
<span>def</span> <span>finished?</span> <span>=</span> <span>available?</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>@internal</span><span>.</span><span>all?</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:finished?</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>clear</span> <span>=</span> <span>@internal</span><span>.</span><span>clear</span>

<h3 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching<a href="#pattern-matching"></a></h3>

<p><strong>Pattern matching, <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#pattern-matching">introduced in 2.7</a>, is no longer experimental.</strong> Discussion: <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17260">Feature #17260</a>.</p>

<h4 id="one-line-pattern-matching-with-">One-line pattern matching with <code>=&gt;</code><a href="#one-line-pattern-matching-with-"></a></h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reason:</strong> This is an interesting one. Two facts were discussed between 2.7 and 3.0: the fact that in most of the other languages one-line pattern matching has a different order (<code>&lt;pattern&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;data&gt;</code>) than introduced in Ruby 2.7 (<code>&lt;data&gt; in &lt;pattern&gt;</code>); and the idea of “rightward assignment operator” <code>=&gt;</code> for more natural chaining. And then, at some point, ideas converged most fruitfully.</li>
  <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17260">Feature #17260</a>  (main pattern matching tracking ticket), <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16670">Feature #16670</a>  (reverse order), <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15921">Feature #15921</a>  (standalone rightward assignment operator), <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15799">Feature #15799</a>  (abandoned “pipeline operator” idea, in discussion of which “rightward assignment” was born)</li>

      <li>One quirk that might be non-obvious: pattern matching can desconstruct-assign only to local variables, so when using <code>=&gt;</code> as an assignment operator, you will see those are syntax errors:

	<div>
		<p>Let’s come back, more directly, to a theme in my writing — what happens when something small becomes a tipping point for change. <strong>When the seemingly innocuous becomes unpredictable.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve only casually followed the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/why-are-there-so-many-protests-in-hong-kong/">Hong Kong protests</a> and reaction from the Chinese mainland and overseas Chinese communities, you might wonder about the importance and meaning of the covered eye. Specifically, the right eye.</p>
<p>Hong Kong protesters found one of their many symbols (and there are many) when police shot and injured the right eye of a protesting woman in August. The injured eye is a more powerful symbol than even that of the man police shot on October 1 (Chinese National Day) in the chest (that is, <em>the heart</em>).</p>
<p>But since the now famous protester’s eye injury we’ve seen company ad campaign apologies and even an individual arrest all because of missing eyes.</p>
<p>But the eye I was reminded of was none of these. It was a different eye — also a right eye and in China — that over 40 years ago had results reminiscent to those eyes of today.</p>

<p>If you are a student of Chinese Cultural Revolution artwork, you might recognize this painting of an owl by Huang Yongyu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl.jpg" alt="Huang Yongyu's owl with one closed eye" width="400" height="607" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Huang served three and a half years in a labor camp for it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/huang-yongyu/owl-1973">painting was interpreted</a> as a “portrayal of public officials turning a blind eye to wrong doings.” It’s not clear if he meant it as such.</p>
<p>Huang’s owl was one of many works of art gathered for a “black painting” (meaning counter-revolutionary) <a href="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6w1007nt&amp;chunk.id=d0e11683&amp;toc.id=d0e10324&amp;toc.depth=100&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;anchor.id=bkd0e11803#X">exhibition and criticism</a> meeting in the 1970s. In some cases, officials had to scrounge around to find more “black painters” to have enough art to criticize. If you read some of the art descriptions, it seems like at least some of the artists were just unlucky rather than counter-revolutionary.</p>
<p>And while I haven’t seen anyone publicly connect Huang’s winking owl with the protests of today, I imagine people with longer memories think about it.</p>
<p>Next in chronology we have of course the event from this summer in Hong Kong. A woman attending a protest was shot in her right eye. Covering one’s <a href="https://www.thelily.com/an-eye-for-an-eye-how-one-womans-eye-patch-became-the-symbol-of-the-hong-kong-protests/">right eye</a> soon became a symbol.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1496" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1496"><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hong-Kong-eye-e1572126020800.png" alt="Covering the right eye" width="600" height="309"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1496">from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/13/how-bloody-eye-patches-became-latest-symbol-escalating-hong-kong-protests/">Washington Post</a> article</figcaption></figure>
<p>And as a good symbol, it is impossible to ignore (you can’t look away from someone’s eyes and still talk). As a good symbol it also brings the eye-patch wearers themselves into some discomfort.</p>
<p>The eye symbol became even better known when a foreign company felt pressure to remove and apologize for an old ad that predated the Hong Kong protests, but which happened to include a covered right eye.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/742601426037240952/">Tiffany ad</a> (since removed) that pre-dates the protests.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1.jpg" alt="Tiffany ad - one covered eye" width="474" height="554" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1.jpg 474w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></p>
<p>And here’s <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/08/tiffany-removes-advert-hong-kong-controversy/">another Tiffany ad</a>, also removed following complaints to the company for stirring up social disorder.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-1024x532.jpg" alt="Tiffany ad - covered right eye" width="525" height="273" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-300x156.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-768x399.jpg 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>And to compare, here’s another picture of Sun Feifei (the same model in the second Tiffany ad) covering her right eye in another photo shoot, also months before the protests in Hong Kong. And actually shown on a <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/photos/2010-04/20/content_19863707.htm">government-run website, even today</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye.jpg" alt="Tiffany model covering her right eye" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye.jpg 400w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>So eye covering can look like a matter of intent. The china.org.cn right eye picture can obviously have no connection to the Hong Kong protests. But a foreign company is different, even with ads shot months before the covered eye became a protest symbol.</p>
<p>Of course, the covered eye — again, the right eye — has been used famously before in an ad campaign: “The Man in the Hathaway Shirt.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-595x800.jpg" alt="Man in the Hathaway shirt" width="525" height="706" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-595x800.jpg 595w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-223x300.jpg 223w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>No political meaning. Just an Ogilvy ad with the eyepatch used as a gimmick.</p>
<p>But there’s more again.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://shanghaiist.com/2019/10/08/houston-rockets-fan-detained-for-posting-photo-of-himself-about-to-burn-chinese-flag/">Houston Rockets fan in China</a> (the same team whose manager posted a “Stand with Hong Kong” tweet) was much too cynical on the ability of his government to track him down.</p>
<p>The first line (after the hashtag) says: “I live and die with my team.” The second line: “Come and catch me.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-1024x546.jpg" alt="Covered right eye, now in jail" width="525" height="280" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest.jpg 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-300x160.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-768x410.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>They caught him, just a few hours later. And it appears he covered an eye to make facial identification more difficult. But again, what if he hadn’t covered his eye?</p>
<p>The apology from Tiffany strikes an international audience as the exportation of anti-protester values. The above picture of the NBA fan chained in a “tiger chair” strikes an international audience as not the future they want for themselves. <strong>Has the visual symbol of the eye — uncontrollable once the injury and advertisements happened — helped spread this message further?</strong></p>
<h2>Wearing of Masks</h2>
<p>Should protesters anywhere be allowed to wear masks? While a number of US states already had <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/10/22/boston-and-hong-kong-debate-over-masks/JYajFCkul7UMw7PaXyZ5vL/story.html">mask bans in public spaces</a>, general public opinion seemed even more in support of the bans after a number of mask wearing Antifa members beat up a reporter in Portland earlier this year. The argument against masks was that covering one’s face minimize the feeling of social disapproval and led to worse behavior.</p>
<p>The US has at times overturned mask bans, famously after the Iranian Revolution as a way to protect Iranian protesters in California. But those masked were protesting a government from which they had fled to the US. It’s a different story when the protesters are domestic.</p>
<p>But a different explanation emerged in the Hong Kong protests now that we have <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/emergence-of-omniscience-part-1-images/">identity at scale</a>. Protesters had already taken cautions to avoid identification by using single-use MTR (metro) transit cards and paying in cash. But faces could be identified at scale either live or in the near future by capturing records of protest attendance, assessing behavior, and following up with repercussions.</p>
<p>Hong Kong protesters also try to take down eyes on the crowd in the form of smart lampposts. There are a number of videos of them <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/24/tear-gas-kwun-tong-hong-kong-protesters-surround-police-station-dismantle-surveillance-lampposts/">dismantling these lampposts</a> out of fear of surveillance.</p>
<p>For me it’s interesting to reflect on the news from Hong Kong because Hong Kong is a place I have visited over almost 30 years. During that time, I also lived there for around six years. Five of the visits and about one year of the living there was pre-Handover. In the time leading up to 1997, I observed (can’t really say I demonstrated) in a few events. These fell into a few types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marches, often along Queen’s Road, in crowds in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.</li>
<li>Sit-down demonstrations outside of the New China News Agency (the NCNA was the de facto Chinese embassy pre-Handover).</li>
<li>June 4th remembrances in Victoria Park (including the last pre-Handover one), often culminating in the crowd holding lit candles. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYwsPt854Xo">Cui Jian’s <em>Nothing To My Name</em></a> would always be played (a song popular at 1989 Tiananmen).</li>
</ul>
<p>No one wore a mask, because there wasn’t any need to do so. The protest leaders were already known. The crowd was safe in numbers. I never heard anyone fear identification, even post-Handover.</p>
<p>If you contrast the protesters of back then with those of the last six months, they are unrecognizable.</p>
<p>That protesters hide their faces and cut down smart lampposts makes sense. Like the eyes in the advertisements above, the lampposts may not have any intent to use facial recognition to identify protesters, but there is no trust. Anything can look suspicious. If the capability is there to help your adversary, then you assume they use it. Especially if there are examples of mass surveillance already in place, for example in the Chinese province of <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/uyghurs-xinjiang-onward-to-the-inevitable/">Xinjiang</a>.</p>
<h2>Consider</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identity at scale can weaken trust.</li>
<li>Visual symbols can spread a message.</li>
<li>Huang Yongyu’s owl paintings now sell at auction.</li>
</ul>

    <p>An agora, in its broadest sense, is a conceptual space where people attempt to bring an increased level of intentionality, explicitness, and mutual agreement to the principles and protocols for interacting in that space. A further aspect of the idea of an Agora is that it is a space which enables collaboration. In particular, it is a space that allows for collaboration guided by specific shared interests, without requiring the co-consitutients of the agora to be aligned more fully or generally in terms of their intentions, values, etc. </p>
<p>Some topics that the idea of an Agora is related to: <a href="http://anagora.org/node/transparency" rel="nofollow">transparency</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/decentralized-structures" rel="nofollow">decentralized structures</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/egalitarian-principles" rel="nofollow">egalitarian principles</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/judgement" rel="nofollow">judgement</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/algorithms-of-interaction" rel="nofollow">algorithms of interaction</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/communication" rel="nofollow">communication</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/collaboration" rel="nofollow">collaboration</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/knowledge-sharing" rel="nofollow">knowledge sharing</a></p>
<p>There are (infinitely) many possible variants of how this idea might be implemented in concrete, real-world situations. For example, an agora could be a space that is opened up inside a conversation between two people. Or it could be a collaborative project that is accompanied by specified rules. Or it could be a collective agreement about how to handle certain types of situations. </p>
<p>One variant of the idea of an Agora is a place where personal notes are shared, with the common goal of pooling information and sharing knowledge. One implementation of this idea is <a href="https://anagora.org/" rel="nofollow">https://anagora.org</a>. See also <a href="https://flancia.org/go/agora" rel="nofollow">https://flancia.org/go/agora</a>.</p>
<p>The term "Agora" and the basic idea come from <a href="http://anagora.org/node/flancia" rel="nofollow">Flancia</a>. </p>

<p>Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta has now been updated 8 times since its launch back in October. The latest software version for FSD Beta is 2020.48.12.15, which is slightly on a different version path from the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/26/tesla-holiday-update-2020-48-26-is-here-v11-gets-delayed-release-notes-video/">2020.48.26 Holiday Update</a>.</p>



<p>The Dual-Motor Tesla Model S with the license plate shouting AIDRIVR has the privilege of being one of the few out there selected by Tesla for FSD Beta testing. In the following video, the owner and driver of this unique Model S takes his car for checking FSD Beta performance out in the snow. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-s/">Tesla Model S</a> in this video is equipped with summer-focused all-season tires, so traction and handling could’ve been better with the winter tires. Tesla’s <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-s-19_-slipstream-wheel-and-winter-tire-package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online shop</a> offers winter wheels and tire packages for the entire vehicle lineup. The Tesla Model S 19″ slipstream winter wheel and tire package range from $2,500 to $4,000. This Model S package includes the 4 x 245/45/19 – Pirelli Sottozero 3 tires.</p>



<p>In the newer Teslas, the Autopilot cameras are heated, so there is a lower probability of the car’s vision becoming blurred due to snow accumulation. </p>

<p>FSD Beta 8 in this series of tests is first evaluated in an almost empty parking lot with lots of snow. In the beginning, the car refuses to engage <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">Autopilot</a> because of invisible road markings. Even when it accepts to be engaged in this snow-filled space, it gets confused and the driving is jerky, at last, it asks the driver to take over and disengages and comes to a full stop when not taken over.</p>



<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/18/autopilot-fsd-beta-will-get-absurdly-good-says-elon-musk-v7-test-videos/">FSD Beta 7 test videos in different scenarios.</a></p>



<h2>On the snowy roads</h2>



<p>In the next phase, the driver puts <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">FSD Beta</a> on a snowy road to test if it works properly. Lane markings are pretty abrupt even after the heavy snowfall is cleared from the road. Lower grip because of non-winter tires is also a limiting factor here, Autopilot might handover the car to the driver if it feels the slippery situation is not safe.</p>

</figure>



<p>At the start of the test, Autopilot was able to predict the drivable space but on its own, it was following the posted speed limit of 30 mph. The cruise speed limit then was set to 15 mph manually, in order to be on the safe side in these snowy conditions.</p>



<p>In the drive ahead, the driver had to take over a couple of times, otherwise Tesla Autopilot was able to handle the path pretty well.</p>



<p>By watching the video closely and from the driver’s feedback it can be easily said that <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">Tesla Autopilot (FSD Beta)</a> is not yet ready for snowy conditions. It will be a while before Autopilot fully learns snow and the scenarios it puts in front of a car driver. However, the video is still fun to watch and I like the owner’s commentary as he has a good grip on the topic of FSD testing.</p>

<p>Below is a loosely-categorized collection of links to CS textbooks in a variety of areas that are
freely available online, usually because they are one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An open textbook (such as PLAI, SF, or the HoTT book)</li>
  <li>An older book that is out of print, for which the copyright has returned to the original author(s)
(such as TTFP)</li>
  <li>An author’s own preprint or draft of a textbook.  This includes cases where the author has made
special arrangements with a publisher to host an electronic copy of a published text on their
homepage while it remains in print.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these I’ve only used for brief personal reference, and have not read in depth.  The exceptions, those books I’ve spent considerable time with and highly recommend, are marked with asterisks.</p>

<p>I also include below a list of papers I consider good stand-alone introductions to certain topics, and a list of links to thorough special topics courses.</p>

<p>If you find one of the links below is broken or has moved, feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>Those with time to spare and looking to have less of it may enjoy browsing the QA call numbers in <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/">UPenn’s extensive listing of online books</a>.  Most of those listed here were found independently over the years, but I’ve just now (June 2020) learned of this excellent repository of links.  I’ll add to the links below as I find promising books.</p>

					Imaging techniques enable a detailed look inside an organism. But interpreting the data is time-consuming and requires a great deal of experience. Artificial neural networks open up new possibilities: They require just seconds to interpret whole-body scans of mice and to segment and depict the organs in colors, instead of in various shades of gray. This facilitates the analysis considerably.

				</p></header><section><p>How big is the liver? Does it change if medication is taken? Is the kidney inflamed? Is there a tumor in the brain and did metastases already develop? In order to answer such questions, bioscientists and doctors to date had to screen and interpret a wealth of data.</p><p>"The analysis of three-dimensional imaging processes is very complicated," explains Oliver Schoppe. Together with an interdisciplinary research team, the TUM researcher has now developed self-learning algorithms to in future help analyze bioscientific image data.</p><p>At the core of the AIMOS software – the abbreviation stands for AI-based Mouse Organ Segmentation – are artificial neural networks that, like the human brain, are capable of learning. "You used to have to tell computer programs exactly what you wanted them to do," says Schoppe. "Neural networks don't need such instructions:" It's sufficient to train them by presenting a problem and a solution multiple times. Gradually, the algorithms start to recognize the relevant patterns and are able to find the right solutions themselves."</p><div id="c61471"><div><div><p>In the AIMOS project, the algorithms were trained with the help of images of mice. The objective was to assign the image points from the 3D whole-body scan to specific organs, such as stomach, kidneys, liver, spleen, or brain. Based on this assignment, the program can then show the exact position and shape.</p><p>"We were lucky enough to have access to several hundred image of mice from a different research project, all of which had already been interpreted by two biologists," recalls Schoppe. The team also had access to fluorescence microscopic 3D scans from the Institute for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine at the Helmholtz Zentrum München.</p><p>Through a special technique, the researchers were able to completely remove the dye from mice that were already deceased. The transparent bodies could be imaged with a microscope step by step and layer for layer. The distances between the measuring points were only six micrometers – which is equivalent to the size of a cell. Biologists had also localized the organs in these datasets.</p></div></div></div><div id="c61472"><div><div><p>At the TranslaTUM the information techs presented the data to their new algorithms. And these learned faster than expected, Schoppe reports: "We only needed around ten whole-body scans before the software was able to successfully analyze the image data on its own – and within a matter of seconds. It takes a human hours to do this."</p><p>The team then checked the reliability of the artificial intelligence with the help of 200 further whole-body scans of mice. "The result shows that self-learning algorithms are not only faster at analyzing biological image data than humans, but also more accurate," sums up Professor Bjoern Menze, head of the Image-Based Biomedical Modeling group at TranslaTUM at the Technical University of Munich.</p><p>The intelligent software is to be used in the future in particular in basic research: "Images of mice are vital for, for example, investigating the effects of new medication before they are given to humans. Using self-learning algorithms to analyze image data in the future will save a lot of time in the future," emphasizes Menze.</p></div></div></div><div><h3>

				<p>This post recounts the journey of writing
<a href="https://github.com/mandreyel/cratetorrent">cratetorrent</a>, interesting
optimizations, and some of the insights gained.</p>
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>Growing up, torrenting was a big thing around me. I was always curious how it
worked.</p>
<p>This curiosity only grew after I had gotten into programming and understood more
details. There is a piece of technology that is so effective yet simple, that,
without any marketing, it gained widespread adoption due to sheer technical
superiority. It just worked and people used it.</p>
<p>So why not write one? I tried, in C++. It was never finished and it’s probably
better that way. Let’s forget it.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few years. I got into Rust and needed a familiar playground to
practice the language. I did what anyone in such a situation would do: I wrote
another torrent engine. It’s torrent engines all the way back.</p>
<p>Thus was cratetorrent born. The name is a wordplay on the C++
<a href="https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent"><code>libtorrent</code> library</a>. Its code and
blog were highly educational during my first attempt. This is my thanks.</p>
<h2 id="torrent-101">Torrent 101</h2>
<p>So how <em>do</em> torrents work?</p>
<p>A brief overview of the BitTorrent V1
protocol follows. For those familiar, feel free to skip to the <a href="#key-optimizations">next
section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3>
<p>BitTorrent is a <em>mostly</em> decentralized file-sharing protocol: it consists of
potentially many symmetrical clients exchanging arbitrary data.</p>
<p>Its advantage over downloading from a single host is that the load is
distributed among all participants in the torrent, thereby increasing
availability, scalability, and often download speed, too.</p>
<p>It used to be highly popular, as everyone used it to share…Linux distros, yes,
and other <em>definitely legal content</em>. Nowadays it’s still in use, but its
use cases are more subtle: e.g. Windows 10 uses BitTorrent, or something like
it, to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/windows-10-uses-your-bandwidth-to-distribute-updates-d-1721091469">distribute
updates</a>
among its users.</p>
<h3 id="whos-in-a-torrent">Who’s in a torrent?</h3>
<p>The first actor on the stage is the torrent <em>metainfo</em> file. It contains basic
metadata about the torrent, most importantly its name, its files with their
paths and lengths, and its <em>trackers</em>. These files are usually hosted by
torrenting sites and this is what you download when starting a torrent.</p>
<p>So what are these trackers? While the download of the content itself is fully
decentralized, a client needs to know which other clients it can download from.
Such other clients in the torrent’s <em>swarm</em> are called <em>peers</em>. Peers that have
all the data are <em>seeds</em>, the rest are <em>leeches</em>. A bit of an uncomfortable
term.</p>
<p>Therefore at the beginning of a download a client asks trackers about
peers. Trackers are the only centralized part of the protocol.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Once done,
the client connects these peers and begins downloading data.</p>
<h3 id="data-representation">Data representation</h3>
<p>A torrent may have one or more files but from the point of view of the wire
protocol they are all just one big contiguous sequence of bytes.</p>
<p>This byte sequence is cut up into equal sized <em>pieces</em>, which are further cut up
into 16 KiB <em>blocks</em>. Peers exchange these blocks of data and use them to
reassemble the torrent’s files.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A peer can only share the complete pieces it has. However, breaking up a piece
into blocks enables downloading it from multiple peers, potentially
completing it sooner. Once complete, the peer can immediately share it with
other peers, even if it does not have all pieces itself. This increases
availability, a key feature of the protocol.</p>
<p>A tricky part here is that files are not padded to align with piece boundaries.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://mandreyel.github.io/images/cratetorrent-data-repr.svg" alt="data representation">
</figure>



<p>This has two consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>the last piece may be smaller than the rest,</li>
<li>and pieces may not align with file boundaries, both shown above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore when writing blocks to disk, they may have to be split across several
files. The logic can get quite gnarly here if done optimally.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="the-peer-protocol">The peer protocol</h3>
<ul>
<li>After the client connected the peer via TCP, they exchange handshakes.</li>
<li>One or both tells the other that it can start requesting blocks.</li>
<li>The client then requests a block from a piece it chose<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, its peer sends it,
and the client saves it.</li>
<li>Repeat until finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s about it, but perhaps surprising no one, a real world implementation will
be quite a bit more complex. Let’s see some of the complications.</p>
<h2 id="key-optimizations">Key optimizations</h2>
<p>(But nothing premature, promise!)</p>
<h3 id="download-pipelining">Download pipelining</h3>
<p>A naive implementation might do what was outlined above: send requests
sequentially, one after the previous request was served. The problem with it is
that it doesn’t utilize the connection’s capacity.</p>
<p>To do so, we try to estimate a connection’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product">bandwidth-delay
product</a> for each peer
that the client is downloading from. This is the maximum amount of data that can
be on the link at any given time–that is, the sent but not yet received bytes.</p>
<p>So to get the best performance we keep as many requests outstanding as would
fill the link’s capacity.</p>
<p>A picture makes this explanation a lot more pleasant:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://mandreyel.github.io/images/cratetorrent-request-pipeline.svg" alt="download pipelining benefits">
</figure>



<p>It’s clearly visible that in the same amount of time, a lot more requests could
be fulfilled. This is the number one most important optimization, strongly
recommended by the spec itself.</p>
<p>Cratetorrent uses a running average for the download rate and a simplified model
of the BDP, by assuming the latency to be a constant 1 second, to get the
request queue size:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> request_queue_size <span>=</span> download_rate <span>/</span> BLOCK_LEN;
</code></pre></div><p>The 1 second value was chosen for simplicity, but it’s a reasonable guess if we
take the link to mean the full request round-trip from one peer’s disk to that
of another.</p>
<h3 id="slow-start">Slow start</h3>
<p>The above suggests an interesting problem: what’s the fastest way of
arriving at the link’s capacity? Taking time to get to this optimum number costs
time. No good.</p>
<p>It turns out that this is a solved problem. To find the answer we just have
to peek one layer below in the network stack: <strong>TCP</strong>.</p>
<p>When a TCP connection is set up, the protocol tries to find the right congestion
window size. This is a fancy way of saying “the number of bytes to send that
doesn’t choke the remote host and everything else in between but still makes use
of the network capacity.” Our purposes are similar.</p>
<p>This is roughly what TCP does:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the start of the connection, set the congestion window size to some
constant.</li>
<li>Send an equivalent number of segments to peer.</li>
<li>For each ACK (acknowledgement message) received, increase the window size by
1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each time all ACKs are received for a volley of segments, the window size
doubles. This growth is exponential, yet the algorithm is confusingly called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control#Slow_start">slow start</a>
(presumably named after the thing it tries to avoid).</p>
<p>TCP stops growing the window when the first timed out or dropped segment is
detected. This would be difficult to replicate in user-space, so cratetorrent
instead increases the request queue size every time a block is received, and
<a href="https://github.com/mandreyel/cratetorrent/blob/master/cratetorrent/src/peer/state.rs#L300-L316">stops</a>
when the download rate isn’t increasing much anymore.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://mandreyel.github.io/images/cratetorrent-slow-start.svg" alt="download pipelining benefits">
</figure>



<p>With each served request, more requests are sent, and the connection is getting
closer to fully using the available bandwidth (the non-blue area is shrinking).</p>
<h3 id="endgame-mode">Endgame mode</h3>
<p>I noticed that sometimes the last phase of a download gets stagnant, barely
progressing from one block to the next.</p>
<p>This happens when the last pending pieces are downloaded from slow peers, which
can delay the completion of a download by a surprising amount.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, this issue is also solved–mentioned in the spec, in fact:</p>
<p>While normally each block is requested from a single peer, blocks in the last
pending pieces should be downloaded from all peers, on a “whoever sends it
first” basis. Once they arrive, requests to the slower peers are simply
cancelled. This wastes some bandwidth but saves quite a bit of time.</p>
<hr>
<p>These were the most significant design choices in terms of how they affected
performance. There are a few more but neither you or I have forever. So let’s
move on and see how all this translates into Rust.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Cratetorrent employs asynchronous IO on the network side, and a thread-pool
backed blocking IO on the disk side. It uses
<a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">Tokio</a> for both, the de facto async IO
runtime in Rust.</p>
<p>The engine’s main components are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>engine</strong> itself, which manages torrents and executes the library user’s
commands.</li>
<li>One or more <strong>torrents</strong>, each corresponding to a single torrent
upload/download. They manage their peers and trackers.</li>
<li>Torrents have an arbitrary number of <strong>peer sessions</strong>, which represent
connections with peers from start to finish. This entity implements the
BitTorrent wire protocol and is as such on the lowest layer.</li>
<li><strong>Disk IO</strong> is handled by an entity of its own, for clarity and separation of
concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are separate <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.13/tokio/task">tasks</a>
(essentially application level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green
threads</a>). Because tasks are
as good as separate threads from the point of view of the borrow-checker, shared
access is not permitted without synchronization. There are two ways to do that.</p>
<h3 id="task-event-loop">Task event loop</h3>
<p>Control flow between tasks is primarily implemented via asynchronous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing"><em>message
passing</em></a>, using
multiple-producer single-consumer
<a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/channels"><em>channels</em></a>. Each task is
reactive: it has an <em>event loop</em> and it reacts to internal events and messages
from other tasks.</p>
<p>Torrents and peer sessions perform a periodic “tick” (like the tick of a clock),
once a second currently, to update their internal state and broadcast messages.
This is when alerts (such as periodic download statistics or “download
complete”) are sent to the library user for example.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>A torrent’s event loop might look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>loop</span> {
    select<span>!</span> {
        <span>// periodic tick
</span><span></span>        _ <span>=</span> tick_timer.select_next_some() <span>=&gt;</span> {
            self.tick().<span>await</span><span>?</span>;
        }
        <span>// peers wanting to connect
</span><span></span>        peer_conn_result <span>=</span> incoming.select_next_some() <span>=&gt;</span> {
            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> Ok(socket) <span>=</span> peer_conn_result {
                self.handle_incoming_peer(socket)<span>?</span>;
            }

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="postTitle"><p>written December 28, 2020 // 1246 words</p></div><div id="mainText"><p>Recently, I’ve been reading <strong>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</strong> written by none other than Yuval Noah Harari, and have been enjoying the book. Its approach to weaving together insights from a vast number of disciplines to create something novel is extremely refreshing. I just read a section on learning, the knowledge illusion, and collaborative thinking and wanted to share some of my thoughts that have been bouncing around and marinating for a few days as well as some learnings that I’ve applied to my own life.</p><h2 id="collaborative-thinking">Collaborative Thinking</h2><blockquote><p>Humans rarely think for themselves. Rather, we think in groups. Just as it takes a tribe to raise a child, it also takes a tribe to invent a tool, solve a conflict, or cure a disease. No individual knows everything it takes to build a cathedral, an atom bomb, or an aircraft.</p></blockquote><p>It is no secret that the key to the rise of <em>Homo Sapiens</em> and the anthropocene wasn’t due to the rationality of any individual human, but rather our collective unparalleled ability to think and share knowledge in large groups. This concept has arisen in the form of <em>specialization of labour</em>.</p><p>As a society, we consistently rely on the knowledge of others to live our own comfortable lives. I may not know how to grow my very own russet potatoes, but a farmer in Alberta might. Similarly, a plumber in Massachusetts may not know how to build their own website, but I might. Through being able to supplement each other’s knowledge of the world, our <em>collective</em> knowledge is much greater.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/knowledge.png" alt="Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge"><em>Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge</em></p><p>I like to think about collective knowledge as a big blob. Each individual contributes a unique <em>subset</em> of knowledge. We get the entirety of human knowledge by taking the <em>union of the knowledge</em> of all the individuals in the group. Of course, as these groups of individuals grow ever larger due to globalization, each individual may choose to specialize in a narrower subset of knowledge as generations go on to reduce redundancy. Why know how to build your own car when you can buy it yourself? The adoption of globally accepted currencies has made this easier than ever.</p><h2 id="knowledge-illusion">Knowledge illusion</h2><p>Humans also have this ‘knowledge illusion’ where we think we know a lot, even though individually we know very little. We treat the knowledge of the human collective as if it were our own, even subconsciously.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/zipper.png" alt="A crude illustration of a jacket zipper"><em>A crude illustration of a jacket zipper</em></p><p>An example Harari used was the sweater zipper. If I were to ask you if you knew how a zipper works, the vast majority of you would exclaim “yes, of course!” Yet, if asked to describe in <em>detail</em> every single step, most would fail to do so. Even with something that seems so basic and intuitive seems to elude an explicit explanation. We have begun to stand on the shoulders of giants yet refuse to acknowledge their presence.</p><p>Although we may have increased the overall area of our collective knowledge, the surface area of each individual has also shrunken, turning from balanced and broad to narrow and unwieldy.</p><h2 id="rebalancing-our-blob-of-knowledge">Rebalancing our blob of knowledge</h2><p>Another interesting property about the knowledge blobs of individuals is that they are <em>magnetic</em>. I mean this in the sense that individuals that have one blob of knowledge tend to attract and be attracted to individuals with similar orientations and shapes in their blobs of knowledge, much like how magnetic dipoles align in a magnet. As humans, we tend to want to minimize our cognitive dissonance and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals is the easiest way to do that.</p><p>Individuals in these clusters experience a sort of echo chamber effect whereby the <em>magnitude</em> of their knowledge is amplified through the mutual alignment of their knowledge. However, this also poses a unique challenge where movement only happens in one direction and there is little to no room to deviate from that direction and try something new; something incredibly dangerous for innovation. This, in a sense, is turning collaborative thinking into groupthink.</p><blockquote><p>People afraid of losing their truth tend to be more violent than people who are used to looking at the world from several different viewpoints.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/spikes.png" alt="Broadening our base fundamental knowledge. Blue: Previous ‘specialized’ knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge"><em>Blue: Previous ‘specialized’ knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge</em></p><p>What we can do to counteract this extreme alignment is to build a broader foundation of knowledge. When you come across an individual with differing views, hopefully you will at least have the base fundamental knowledge to understand their perspective.</p><h2 id="learning-communities">Learning communities</h2><p>This, at least in part, is why I’ve recently become more certain of wanting to go to grad school in the future. I used to have tunnel-vision in thinking that all I wanted to do in the future was to just work in industry CS. Recently, I’ve started to realize that CS not a single discipline, but rather it’s a tool that can help solve uniquely human problems, and these human problems are inherently multidisciplinary.</p><p>I’ve started to read and learn more about the world around me outside of my little bubble of CS-related topics and it’s been eye-opening to see issues I read about in my philosophy class come up in a linguistics lecture which in turn comes up in a book I’m reading. I’ve found that the best way for me to cement my learning and understanding is through discussion with people, rather than just sitting and ruminating on my own – a very different pace than the typical <em>code-Stackoverflow-copy-repeat</em> self-learning cycle that most programmers (including myself) are familiar with.</p><p>The important part of learning communities like colleges is not necessarily the alignment in what you’re studying, but rather in the shared mindset of discussion, learning, and understanding. To broaden my foundation of knowledge is to read more about the opinions and findings of others and to critically discuss these among peers who may have different views. If we want our specialized knowledge to be applicable in a wide range of situations, we need a broad foundational base that can support that.</p><h2 id="wiggle-room">Wiggle room</h2><blockquote><p>If you want to go deeply into any subject, you need a lot of time, and in particular, you need the privilege of wasting time. You need to experiment with unproductive paths, explore dead ends, make space for doubts and boredom, and allow little seeds of insight to slowly grow and blossom</p></blockquote><p>For me, learning is very close to a zero-sum game. I can only expand the area of my knowledge blob so fast. If I want to broaden my foundational knowledge base, I need to reign in the amount of time spent growing purely technical strengths and to stop saying ‘yes’ to any and every opportunity that comes up.</p><p>Slowly but surely, I’m learning to value my own time and to set it aside to just absorb more about the world and to extend the reaches of my knowledge just a little bit further. To dilly-dally among the Wikipedia rabbit holes and faff among the ridiculously long list of side projects I planned to start. I’m experimenting with what I previously thought were deadends and little seeds of insight are starting to grow. Maybe I’ll find something interesting to share among the construction of this broader foundation.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><p>A big thank yu to <a href="https://twitter.com/ansonyuu">Anson</a> for always being a sounding board for fresh dough (half-baked ideas would be too generous of a description for these).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><h2 id="b46e">Built-in Mac SSD Encryption Is Easily Bypassed by an Attacker With Physical Access if Filevault Isn’t Enabled</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/@fritz_?source=post_page-----d5e2f55c083b--------------------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Fritz Ifert-Miller" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/0*m1fK8ctg-lpc-4R5." width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div><p id="0760">If you buy a modern Mac in 2020, it is going to come with a special physical component called the Secure Enclave. This component enables Apple to carry over many popular iOS features which require extra hardware security like Touch ID and Apple Pay to the Mac.</p><p id="4f7b">One of the lesser-known features of the Secure Enclave is that it performs automatic hardware based encryption of a Mac’s built-in SSD. This means that without any user intervention, your new Mac is encrypted right out of the packaging. With this fact in mind, you may be wondering if taking the extra step of enabling FileVault is still necessary? I am here to tell you, <strong>yes, it is absolutely </strong>necessary<strong>.</strong></p><p id="c7b9">An encrypted Mac without FileVault allows anyone who has physical access to your device to trivially read your personal data. They don’t even need to know your password. Even worse, some tools used to detect FileVault’s status (like <a href="http://osquery.io/" rel="noopener">osquery</a>), can conflate the differences between <strong>Encrypted</strong> versus <strong>FileVault On</strong> causing you to believe the data on your Mac is safe, when in fact, it’s unprotected from the most common scenarios wherein we rely on encryption to save us.</p><p id="6c62">In this article we will review the current situation, the steps you should take to ensure you are correctly polling this information, and how we are patching osquery to resolve this confusion.</p><ul><li id="5e11">The osquery <code>disk_encryption</code> table as of December 20th, 2020, reports a value of <code>encrypted = 1</code> for <strong>all T2 and M1 Macs</strong>, <em>regardless of the FileVault status</em>. This information is technically correct, but has likely resulted in inaccurate interpretations about FileVault’s status.</li><li id="138f">Kolide determined that the SSD of Encrypted Macs without FileVault can be trivially accessed with simple physical access to the device.</li><li id="df8d">Kolide <a href="https://github.com/kolide/launcher/pull/686" rel="noopener">shipped a hotfix for its own customers</a> with a new launcher table <code>kolide_filevault_status</code>, and amended its Check to address the issue.</li><li id="ce2e">Kolide <a href="https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6823" rel="noopener">shipped a patch for the osquery</a> <code>disk_encryption</code> table to include a new column: <code>filevault_status</code></li></ul><p id="0577">For 30 years, Apple has included a tool with its operating systems called ‘Target Disk Mode’. This utility allowed a user to mount the disk of one Apple device, on another device as a network volume. There are a variety of reasons this functionality is helpful, the most common being, the retrieval of data on a Mac that no longer boots successfully.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7944/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png" width="3972" height="2130" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Apple’s built in Target Disk Mode makes it stupid easy to dump the entire contents of an “encrypted” Mac that doesn’t have FileVault enabled</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="8058">However, using macOS’s Target Disk Mode an attacker with physical access to a device can trivially access the contents of the disk by physically connecting it to another computer and booting it in Recovery Mode.

With this new Secure Enclave CPU, Apple moved from a pattern of software encryption (FileVault2) to automatic hardware encryption. In 2020, on the newly introduced Apple Silicon Macs, a similar Secure Enclave is built right into the M1 SoC.</p><p id="24db">Both the T2 and the M1 Secure Enclave securely store a 256-bit AES key (UID) which cannot be directly accessed and is burnt into the chip, protecting both the SSD’s data and the TouchID sensor’s stored fingerprints, as well as disabling the device’s camera and microphone when the computer is locked.</p><p id="fe41">What this means in practice, is that the data on a Mac’s disk cannot be accessed once the disk is physically separated from the Mac or if the underlying encryption key is lost. In fact, if your Secure Enclave is damaged or wiped, this encryption will prevent you from accessing any of the contents of the drive. This is yet another failure mode one must negate with backups (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/guide/mac-help/mh11421/11.0/mac/11.0" rel="noopener">which come with their own encryption considerations</a>)</p><p id="74e6">Before the introduction of the T2 security chip, disk encryption was synonymous with FileVault configuration on macOS. However, with hardware encryption this distinction became multi-faceted. This nuance was particularly problematic for security agents that did not differentiate between a disk that was ‘encrypted’ and a device that had FileVault configured.</p><p id="b412">Unfortunately, osquery fell into that camp, and its <code>disk_encryption</code> table simply returned a boolean value for the column <code>encrypted</code>, leading many to draw an erroneous conclusion causing a false sense of security.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1" width="1600" height="1029" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Osquery conflates the differences between FileVault and Encryption in its `disk_encryption` virtual table leading to False Negatives</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="8637">This issue was discovered when the output of common macOS terminal utilities (<code>diskutil apfs list</code> and <code>fdesetup status</code>) returned different information from what was observed when querying devices using osquery.</p><p id="c10b">This issue proved initially difficult to track down, due to the false-negative nature. It is often easier to track down a coding issue producing a false-positive but an intermittent false negative can be truly maddening. Because users are encouraged during setup to configure FileVault on new devices it is uncommon to see devices without it, this coupled with the fact that the table worked as expected on older hardware, led to a difficulty in establishing a pattern and subsequently a lag-time in discovery.</p><p id="1e06">Fortunately with some additional reverse engineering of Kolide <a href="https://github.com/kolide/launcher/pull/686" rel="noopener">updated its own agent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6823" rel="noopener">Osquery itself</a> to report this data accurately.

    <p>One of the biggest disadvantages of static site generators is that
they are static and can’t include comments.</p>
<p>There are multiples solutions to solve this problem. You could add
a third party blog engine like Disqus, but this has the drawback
of including a third-party tool with a bad privacy record in your
website. Another solution would be to host an open-source alternative
but this comes at the cost of a higher maintenance burden. Having
to host a database was something we wanted to avoid with a
static site generator.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a better solution is to leverage the Mastodon and
Fediverse platform. Mastodon is a decentralized social network
and it allows people to communicate with each other without
being on the same server. It is inspired by Twitter, but instead
of tweeting, you write toot.</p>
<p>When publishing an article, you now only need to also write a
simple toot linking to your article. Then Mastodon has a simple
API to fetch the answer to your toot. This is the code I made for
my Hugo powered blog, but it is easily adaptable for other static
site generators. It will create a button to load comments instead
of loading them for every visitor so that it decreases the load on your
mastodon server.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>But first, something completely different. Sometime in 2015 I caught wind of Elon Musk. There was something relatable in the way he spoke about being bullied, education <sup>(1)</sup>, and the future. His demeanor lit a spark that made me realign with myself, resurrecting my usual optimistic outlook. Further still, I became enamored by his companies which reinvigorated my long-lost curiosity and fascination with science. Waking up in the morning became exciting again; similar to my 10-year-old self during the summer: not a care in the world, ready to explore.</p>

    <p>Not being able to afford a Tesla car, the only way I could support him was through buying Tesla shares. So that's what I did, at the all-time high, right before it plummeted. In a fit of panic I wanted to sell, but the revolutionary workings of its cars and the Gigafactory, and their abundance of talent reassured me they were vastly ahead of the game. So I kept buying until the graph bottomed out, and soon enough my portfolio turned green. That the stock market closes at night and during the weekends made the whole experience tenable, more relaxed. But not for long.</p>

    <h2>“Drinking the Kool-Aid”</h2>
    <p>“is an expression used to refer to a person who believes in a possibly doomed or dangerous idea because of perceived potential high rewards.” <sup>(2)</sup></p>

    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/kool-aid-man.png" alt="Kool-Aid man."></p><p>On Reddit I met a fellow Tesla fan who said his two most profitable investments were Tesla and bitcoin. Initially I didn't bother, but some three months later it reappeared. My motivations for investing had begun to shift. Primarily supporting a cause and secondarily making some money—beating inflation—traded places. Profit took precedence.</p>

    <p>At a price of $1200 and rising I drank the decentralized Kool-Aid. Each day I woke up richer—on paper. The increases that took Tesla several months happened overnight, and owning a million dollars grew less and less farfetched. “This is not a bubble. This time is different. We're at the start of the adoption curve.” Man, it felt good! In my naivety I dreamt about buying a house, or building a skate park named after bitcoin. I was high on “hopium” and living in a fantasy world. Gradually my time spent learning, reading, or developing real life skills decreased. Being rich became the ultimate goal and I merely had to sit back and watch. Then the bubble popped, “Kansas went bye-bye”.</p>

    <p>“If only I had done this or that” was my prevailing mode of thought, “I could've had so much more!” Although I never day traded, I did diversify, no, gamble into a handful of alternative coins in order to try my luck catching the next 400% price pump. No dice. I wasted so much time waiting for it “to moon” or trying to “catch falling knives” <sup>(3)</sup>. Not only were the results as succesful as dart throwing chimps <sup>(4)</sup>, it also significantly increased my anxiety. The regular stock market seldom impacted my day-to-day emotions, but the 24/7 cryptocurrency market did—more than I consciously realize or care to admit. At one point I had my intestines checked because my doctor feared cancer. Fortunately it was a false alarm, and the symptoms caused by a mild inflammation subsided when I stopped stress eating junk food. If only I listened to my body and did a U-turn at this point. Sadly, greed had taken over; I wanted to procure the same amount of profit as if I had never diversified.</p>

    <p>While the bear market was still in play I finished reading The Bitcoin Standard, the most revered book on bitcoin, promoting it as the best currency we've ever had. Still oblivious about its toxic community, and neglecting some of the book's historical inaccuracies, I assumed the content was credible and genuine since the author was a professor in economics. Moreover, after sending him a list of typos and errors he returned the favor by giving me access to his paywalled pdf files. To be able to help such an esteemed professor made me feel elated. I was ready to go all in, and I did. Selling my remaining Tesla shares at $290 at a loss to buy bitcoin at the bottom simultaneously marked my own rock-bottom, for I was dabbing in evil. Even though I was extremely lucky by having caught a falling knife an inch from the floor, I started rooting for a decline in the former and a surge in the latter. Imagine my saltiness when Tesla suddenly shot up to just shy of $1000. Bitcoin had risen as well, but it wasn't good enough. Dumbass.</p>

    <h2>“My precious!”</h2>
    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/smeagol.jpg" alt="Smeagol or Gollum; Lord of the Rings."></p><p>“He hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the Ring most of all.” <br>
    “What do you mean?” said Frodo. “Surely the Ring was his Precious and the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn't he get rid of it, or go away and leave it?” <br>
    “You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,” said Gandalf. “He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.” —<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings">“The Lord of the Rings”</a> by J.R.R. Tolkien</p>

    <p>Slowly I became like Gollum. Which is ironic because I love The Lord of the Rings for the exact opposite reasons: calling for adventure, exploration, to love your friends, and to live in harmony with nature. Instead I fell in love with “my precious”, sitting at home watching numbers, albeit in the comfort of a picturesque wallpaper. Bitcoin made me as selfish and greedy as the bankers it was supposed to be against.</p>

    <p>If not for skateboarding I wouldn't have stayed sane. It pulled me out of isolation and held my soul intact despite being otherwise bereft of life. Bitcoin's one redeeming quality, because it temporarily made me feel rich, was that I learned to spend more generously on things that merited it, like skateboarding or lichess.org <sup>(5)</sup>. Whereas before I tried saving on nearly everything.</p>

    <p>Fast-forward to some months before Covid-19. Something smelled fishy. Bitcoin's price had been rising, which was exciting, but some doubts arose about the aforementioned professor: Saifedean Ammous. I stumbled upon his Twitter profile… “What the fuck.” The amount of conspiratorial nonsense mixed with academically dishonest douchebaggery was flabbergasting. “Is this guy really a professor?” I gave him the benefit of the doubt until I emailed him regarding meat, a topic he regularly rants about. The full convo is available in the appendix, but here's a taste:</p>

    <p>“I need an echo chamber because the world is FULL of brainwashed malnourished clueless nuts like you”</p>

    <p>I'm not proud of my conversation with him, but the way he talked like a neglected pubescent brat taught me to assume good intentions yet scrutinize everyone; even if they have a PhD to their name. “Saifegate” severely shook my confidence: “If this guy wrote the most popular book on bitcoin, then what the fuck does the rest of its community consist of?”</p>

    <h2>Bitcoin is dead inside.</h2>
    <p>From then on toxic bitcoin maximalists (and crypto currency nuts) appeared everywhere. Remember that “fishy smell” from before? It turned into dogshit. What bitcoin stood for had transitioned the way I had. It wasn't about changing the world anymore, but about increasing one's own wallet. My disregard culminated at the sight of the following series of events:</p>

    <p>“Just BTFD #bitcoin” —Adam Back</p>

    <p>“Btw it was what I did this morning "Just BTFD #bitcoin
      " ie "Just Bought TFD". I had seen DMs about buying on waking up and looking at price, then saw news @coinbase
      crashed (yet again), and bought some at $8600.” —Adam Back; <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1259386895806726144">source</a></p>

    <p>If a CEO that feels the need to encourage people into buying a product he has vested interests in isn't a red flag, then I don't know what is; products should speak for themselves. The possibility of him being Satoshi Nakamoto didn't help either:</p>

    <p><sub>—YouTube: “Bitcoin - Unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto” by Barely Sociable</sub></p><p>But wait, it doesn't end there. Here's Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer who helps build the software running on thousands of computers.</p>

    <p>“Masturbation is a very grave sin, arguably even worse than murder.” —Luke Dashjr; <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1223706601871302658">source</a>.</p>

    <p>“I don't have a dog, but I would totally try one and eat it if it tastes decent. Had a cat once. Planned to eat it, but something else got to it first. Currently have a pair of male &amp; female bunny. Plan to eat some of the babies, but… we're failing to get them to breed.” —Luke Dashjr; <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1169615995742380035">source</a>.</p>

    <p>“You have it backwards. Guns protect life. And no, animals have no rights. They also exist specifically for human consumption.” —Luke Dashjr; <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1169669024369795072">source</a>.</p>

    <p>Completely nuts. Sure, someone's religion doesn't necessarily prevent them building decent things. But if one is capable of such fallacious reasoning and fully supporting barbaric practices, then they're capable of implementing some iffy stuff in whatever they do. Here he justifies slavery and geocentrism: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/4936kw/lukejr_is_a_seriously_a_super_crazy_person_quotes/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/4936kw/lukejr_is_a_seriously_a_super_crazy_person_quotes</a>.</p>

    <p>To consider I once thought the crypto scene was a bit crazy because of this ridiculous performance during an Ethereum convention (another crypto currency); boy, did I have another thing coming…</p>

    <p><sub>—YouTube: “EDCON 2019 - Vitalik and Ethereum Foundation dance and rap”</sub></p><p>I want to stop writing about this soulless topic so bad, but I'm not done yet. People need to know what they're getting into. A purely speculative uninspirational asset, that's what.</p>

    <p>Speculation has become bitcoin's main purpose, but without the capability for large-scale transactions <sup>(6)</sup>. Unlike our day-to-day currencies, which are used for both. Earning money by trading money is a worthless “skill”. Doing so produces nothing of real value to society and the same goes for day trading stocks. This is aptly communicated by Matthew McConaughey in The Wolf of Wallstreet:</p>

    <p>“Number one rule of Wallstreet. […] Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up, down, sideways or in fucking circles. Least of all, stockbrokers, right? It's all a fugazi. […] It's fairy dust. It doesn't exist. It's …</p></div></div>

        <div><p>A <span><a title="Longitudinal Study into Violent Video Games" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2020.0049">ten-year longitudinal study</a></span>&nbsp;published in the Journal of <em>Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking</em> on a group in early adolescence from as young as ten years old, investigated how playing violent video games at an early age would translate into adulthood behavior (23 years of age). Titled "Growing Up with Grand Theft Auto: A 10-Year Study of Longitudinal Growth of Violent Video Game Play in Adolescents" the study found no correlation between growing up playing video games and increased levels of aggression ten years later.</p><p>This particular study utilized a more contemporary approach for analyzing its data, known as the person-centered approach. Traditional studies use a variable-centered approach whereby researchers treat each variable, or characteristic, as related to another variable. An example would be that exercising is related to a reduced incidence of heart disease. This has been particularly valuable when comparing groups. In a person-centered approach researchers combine various algorithms across variables to determine how these variables compare among individuals. This approach provides a more accurate depiction of how variables relate to the individual.</p><p>As such, this study “accounts for heterogeneity, grouping individuals who are similar and who share a set of characteristics that vary similarly over time.” Participant families were recruited through “a large north-western city” beginning in 2007 (Wave 1) via telephone directories and required to complete questionnaires. 65% were Caucasian, 12% black and 19% multi-ethnic, 4% other. Families of lower socioeconomic status were underrepresented as part of the initial sample group and therefore needed recruitment via referrals and fliers to add to and diversify the sample group.</p><p>Video game violence ratings were assessed through the Common Sense Media, known to be a viable rating body for media. Participants were assessed through various behavioral characteristics such as aggression, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and prosocial behavior.</p><p>Results showed that boys played more violent video games than girls. Groups displayed three forms of video game play, according to the study: high-initial violence (4%) which indicated individuals played a high-level of violent video games at an early age, moderate initial violence (23%) whereby violent video game play was moderate at an early age, and low initial violence (73%).</p><p>The study concluded that group with low initial violence “was no higher in aggressive behavior than the high initial violence group at the final time point.” Therefore, it is determined that adolescents who played a high-level of violent video games at an early age did not show more aggressive behavior later in life than those who played fewer to no hours of violent video games at an early age.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <p><img alt="git cake: when is my README's birthday?" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bhupesh-V/Bhupesh-V.github.io/master/images/git-cake-day-demo.png"></p><p>Do you want to know when was a file/directory committed in your git repo?
Well here is <code>git log</code> at your rescue!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
git log <span>--date</span><span>=</span>format:<span>'%d %b %Y'</span> <span>--diff-filter</span><span>=</span>A <span>--name-only</span> <span>--pretty</span><span>=</span><span>'%n%C(yellow bold)🎂️ %ad%Creset by (%C(blue bold)%h%Creset)'</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34342551/103223519-6b366080-494c-11eb-9d54-acebd0179ffb.png" alt="git-cake-demo-paager"></p>

<p>Ok ok! Let me explain for you lazy asses</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>--date=format:'%d %b %Y'</code></p>

    <p>This is pretty much self explanatory, suit this to your own preferred date format. <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---dateltformatgt">Other date formats</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>--diff-filter=A --name-only</code></p>

    <p>This lets you filter nodes that were Added(A). Other filters include: Copied(C), Deleted(D), Modified(M) or Renamed(R).
Multiple filters can be used together e.g <code>--diff-filter=AC</code>.</p>

    <p>The <code>--name-only</code> shows only names of changed files. If you had like to print some status as well use <code>--name-status</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>--pretty='%n%C(yellow bold)🎂️ %ad%Creset by (%C(blue bold)%h%Creset)</code></p>

    <p>This is the beauty that is responsible for printing <code>🎂️ 18 Jun 2019 by (f72312c)</code>.</p>

    <p>Git provides us with various format specifiers these include.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>%n  : newline</li>
      <li>%h  : abbreviated commit hash (short version, use %H for complete hash)</li>
      <li>%ad : author date that respects the previously specified –date= option</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats"><strong>Read git pretty docs</strong></a> for info. on all 50+ options</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Read more than 2000 lines worth of git log manual (<code>git log --help</code>) when you feel absolutely free :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should add this in your <code>.gitconfig</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[user]
	email = varshneybhupesh@gmail.com
	name = Bhupesh-V
[commit]
	template = /home/bhupesh/.gitmessage
[core]
	editor = nano
[credential]
	helper = store
[alias]
        cake = log --date=format:'%d %b %Y' --diff-filter=A --name-only --pretty='%n%C(yellow bold)🎂️ %ad%Creset by (%C(blue bold)%h%Creset)'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now send me some presents, will ya?
Please?</p>

<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion <span></span></h2>



<p>If you are looking at Raspberry Pi alternatives in 2021 there is a range of options at various specifications and prices. Although at the time of writing some of these options are yet to be released I believe that they will be relevant within the next few months. </p>



<p>Raspberry Pi alternatives have always been an interest to me as they often create innovating products before the Raspberry Pi foundation. This is not to say I have anything against Raspberry Pi’s they are absolutely the well deserved leader in this market and still offer the best support and community. </p>



<div><p>If anyone believes I have missed a Raspberry Pi alternative from the list please comment below and I will review it and potentially add it to the list. </p><p>Watch this space as a good amount of the SBC’s mentioned in this list will be reviewed by myself in early 2021.   </p></div>

<hr>
<p>It's that time between Christmas and new year again, where you can usually find me at Leipzig's Congress Zentrum on my computer hacking away. It's chaos congress time. Given this year's pandemic, the "37c3" however, was moved to the internet and renamed to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/">"rc3", the Remote Chaos Communication Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the iconic congress build-up started. This time around, building up didn't involve moving heavy crates of mate tea around. Instead, it meant that everyone started designing, drawing, and building their assembly maps for the "rc3.world". A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/">2D virtual space</a> that's supposed to replace this year's lack of physical space.</p>
<p>The rc3.world software is a fork of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://workadventu.re/">workadventu.re</a>, a 2D game simulating a virtual work environment with avatars. Within this 2D map of the virtual congress, the organizers invited all assemblies to build their own spaces. And so, as the build-up for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a> assembly began, I had an idea for a project.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-synth-screenshot.png" alt=""><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, the project I launched at last year's c3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At last year's congress in Leipzig, I had launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, a synthesizer built in WebAssembly. Naturally, this time I was eager to take the project to the next stage. Hence, roughly a week ago, I started to work on a new project called "WASM-STREAM" - an extension to wasm-synth.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol/wasm-stream">WASM-STREAM</a> is a virtual stage for digital artists. Using WASM-STREAM, an artist can broadcast their play with wasm-synth to an internet radio stream. More importantly, though, this means that they can take the stage on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a>'s assembly and jam away to a virtually present audience.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-stream.png" alt=""><figcaption>Social Dist0rtion Protocol's dance floor in the rc3.world</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So how did I build it?</p>
<h2 id="a-first-little-demo">A First Little Demo</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a> is a project that I built deliberately to showcase the power of the web. At the beginning of the year, I wrote <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">a blog post</a> outlining its technical details. It's using the <code>AudioWorklet</code> and some WebAssembly-transpiled code to render audio in real-time in the user's browser.</p>
<p>Now, workadventure, the software ccc uses to run their rc3.world, is also built on the web and allows embedding audio streams. So I thought, why not take the audio generated in wasm-synth and stream it to everyone in the rc3 world.</p>
<p>In a way, it sounds like not that big of a deal to build an audio streaming client within a website. But remember that a browser's networking ability is limited. While we've come a long way from the <code>XMLRequest</code> API to <code>fetch</code>, <code>WebSocket</code> and <code>WebRTC</code>, these concepts only allow talking upstream if their authors deliberately built their upstream application for supporting them.</p>
<p>Naive as I Am, I started by deploying <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> to a small Hetzner instance. I configured an authorized mount point that allows a streamer to connect using client software. Then I looked for a way to stream audio directly to icecast from a browser. And found... nothing.</p>
<p>Well, I did find something. It's called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webcast.github.io/">webcast</a>, and it's a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">WebSocket-based subprotocol</a> that allows sending binary audio data between a client and a server. In their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js#server">README.md</a>, the authors also mention webcast's compatibility with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/">liquidsoap</a>, a DSL for audio stream processing.</p>
<p>So my first attempt at plugging these things together involved encoding the <code>Float32Array</code> data from the <code>AudioWorklet</code> into an mp3 stream using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/toots/shine/">libshine</a> (that has a wasm JavaScript package) and then sending it to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/harbor.html">liquidsoap "harbor"</a> via webcast. Liqidsoap would then convert the mp3 stream to ogg-vorbis, make it stereo, and forward it to the icecast server.</p>
<p>And, to my surprise, it worked. When I hit some keys on the wasm-synth, they got encoded and sent to the audio stream. With a bit of delay, I heard what I had just played. Cool!</p>
<p>Anyways, with my small little demo, I was galvanized and motivated enough to spend more time building something that would work for the congress.</p>
<h2 id="the-wasm-stream-architecture">The WASM-STREAM Architecture</h2>
<p>Ultimately, liquidsoap was not well-suited for my purpose. I also quickly realized that all I had to do was build a proxy between the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/ePirat/adc3b8ba00d85b7e3870">icecast protocol</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">webcast protocol</a>. And that's what I ended up building. A small <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">JavaScript application</a> implementing two protocols. It listens for incoming WebSocket connections and calls icecast with a loooooonng PUT request to establish a stream.</p>
<p>WASM-STREAM itself doesn't do any encoding. It can, however, route an <code>audio/ogg</code> or an <code>audio/mpeg</code> stream from webcast to icecast. The encoding from WAV to mp3 takes place on the user's device already when the play the synthesizer.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-wasm-stream">How To Use WASM-STREAM</h2>
<p>Whether you have a ticket to rc3 or not, you can tune into the stream at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream">https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream</a>. It's an mp3-encoded stream, meaning it won't work in all browsers equally (Firefox works natively; Chrome et al. only support ogg/vorbis natively). If it doesn't, try a desktop application like iTunes or VLC.</p>
<p>The stream is continuously online. But if you don't hear anything then that's because nobody is currently playing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">WASM-SYNTH</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you're able to "dance" on the Social Dist0rtion Protocol's assembly dance floor. The rc3 orga was nice enough to allow us streaming audio on our map. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/rc3/room/93840a8f-88f7-4f11-bb61-68800c4d4962/">Click here</a> to visit us directly on the rc3.world map.</p>

<hr>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>If you want to make ascii art the first thing you should know is that
you don't need a special program, or special skills to make it
with. All you need is somewhere to type text into - your e-mail
program, notepad, wordpad, that sort of thing - and an idea of what
you want to draw. There are no secrets or rules other than the
following:

</p><ol>
  <li> Use a non-proportional or fixed width font. Click <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~klr/fonts.html">HERE</a> for a
          page on this site that will tell you what they are, or ask
          me for the text version of the page via e-mail.

  </li><li> Don't use tabs!! Always, but always use the space bar (or your
 cursor keys/mouse if the program you're typing in supports that) for
 empty spaces. The reason for this is that different computers and
 programs interperet the size of a tab space differently, so although
 what you see on your screen looks fine, on someone else's your pic
 may look all split up.

 </li><li> Only use the keyboard characters on an American standard
 keyboard. That means all the letters, numbers and punctuation that
 you can see printed on the keyboard keys. You can use the shift key,
 but don't use the alt key to make characters. The reason for this is
 similar to that for not using tabs - different computers interperet
 alternative characters in different ways. The idea behind ascii is
 that all computers can read it because it's made up of characters
 that all computers will recognise.

 </li><li> Don't leave empty spaces at the end of each line. Make sure every
 line that you type ends on the last character, and not a few spaces
 after it. This can cause problems on other systems, with line
 wrapping and so on.
</li></ol>

<h2>Your First Ascii</h2>

<p>The best way to make a start is to take someone else's picture and see
if you can copy it. That way you get a feel for how you can use
different characters. We'll start easy. Try copying these shapes,
which only use the characters:

</p><pre> / \  |  _ 
 ___               ___
|   |      /\     /   \
|___|     /__\    \___/
</pre>

<p>Easy huh? Now try making the same shapes again using the characters: 

</p><pre>-  "  .  ,  `  :  &gt;  &lt;
</pre>

<p>This is what I came up with: 

</p><pre> .---.       .        .--.
 :   :     .' `.     &lt;    &gt;
 "---"     "---"      `--'
</pre>

<p>Bit more tricky, and it doesn't look as neat, but some of these
characters, and knowing how you can use them can come in very handy at
times, which we'll see later. Have a go at copying these, just for
practice. Change them if you like:
</p><pre> _   _    __    _   _                                   .^._    __
| |_| |_.'  `._| |_| |    /\  /\  /\  /\       /\      /   \|   \ \
|  _   _      _   _  |   /  \/  \/  \/  \    .'  `.   /_____V   / /
|_| |_| `.__.' |_| |_|  / /\  /\  /\  /\ \  &lt;      &gt;  |[]_[]|   \ \
                        \/  \/  \/  \/  \/   `.  .'   | |+| |   / /
                                               \/     `"""""'   \_\</pre>

<h2>Curves</h2>

<p>It's handy to know where the characters 'sit' on each line. Are they
at the top, in the middle or on the bottom of the line? A couple of
ascii characters vary in their position from computer to computer, but
mostly they all sit in the same place. Have a go yourself on your
keyboard. Here are some examples.

</p><pre>Top of line:            " ` '
Top or middle of line:  ^ * ~ =
Middle of line:         - +
Bottom of line:         _ . ,
</pre>

<p>You can use all these characters on one line to make a pattern, like
these:

</p><pre>_.,-=~+"^'`*`'^"+~=-,._.,-=~+"^'`*`'^"+~=-,._.,-=~+"^'`*`'^"+~=-,._


"^`'*-=~+,._.,+~=-*'`^"^`'*-=~+,._.,+~=-*'`^"^`'*-=~+,._.,+~=-*'`^"
</pre>
<p>Now try making a simple sig with a decorative border, using all the
characters we've met so far. This is what I came up with:
</p><pre>                        _________________________
  ..,,++~~--==**''``^^""  Hayley Jane wakenshaw  ""^^``''**==--~~++,,..
 /|\                     flump@quadrant.xs4all.nl                    /|\
&lt; : &gt; Flump's Fantastic Ascii Collection  http://www.xs4all.nl/~klr &lt; : &gt;
 \|/ "Daddy.. why doesn't the magnet pick up your floppy disks?..."  \|/
  ""^^''``**--==~~++,,.._________________________..,,++~~==--**``''^^""
</pre>

<h2>Using The Other Characters</h2>

<p>The other ascii characters fall into three categories. Either they're
the full height of the line or they're half height. Capitals and
numbers are always full height. Compare them to some of the others -
which are half height, and which are full height? Some examples:

</p><pre>Full height: A 7 % @ ! # ) ; &amp; $ ] } | / &gt; l t f k h d ?
Half height: a o v z
</pre>

<p>And then there's the 3rd sort. The characters that look like half
height, but sit a little lower on the line, like they would in
handwriting. These are: j g y p q

</p><p>And all together they can make a slight curve, just like the others:
</p><pre>pqyjgacoevA8!@)lf$%;$fl(@!8AveocagjypqacoevA8!@)lf$%;$fl(@!8Aveoc
</pre>

<h2>Lines and Diagonals</h2>

<p>There are three basic lines to any picture - straight (either
horizontally, or vertically), diagonal, and the third is the curve,
which includes circles. We'll look at straight and diagonal lines
first. Horizontal and vertical lines are simple in ascii - here are
some examples:
</p><pre>Horizontal: 8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
            """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
            ----------------------------------------------------------
            __________________________________________________________
            ..........................................................


Vertical:   |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
</pre>
<p>Diagonals are a bit more tricky. You can make simple ones using the /
and \ keys. Diagonals with other gradients need a technique similar to
that used to make slight curves. Experiment yourself to see how you
can make different angles. Here are some examples to start you off:

</p><pre>       /         .'               _,-'                            __
      /        .'             _,-'                        __..--''

<h2>Circles</h2>

<p>By now we've looked at the basic characters, character height, slight
curves, lines, and slopes. The last thing to look at is what many
people who make ascii have trouble with: circles. You're half way
there already, though, because ascii circles are basically a mix of
vertical and horizontal lines, slopes or diagonals, and curves. After
a little practice, you'll get a feel for making different sized
circles - I have a basic set of circles in a file that I refer to when
I need a circular or rounded shape in an ascii pic, so now I can make
them easily in all sorts of sizes. Start making small circles - how
many ways can you think of to make a circle in under 5 lines? The
bigger the circle the more rounded it can be, but try making circles
of different sizes and see what you come up with. These are mine:
</p><pre>                                               __
                          _   /""\            /  \
1 line:  O ()   2 lines: (_)  \__/   3 lines: \__/

                                                     ____
           ___               .-''-.                .'    `.
4 lines:  /   \   5 lines:  /      \   6 lines:   /        \
         |     |           |        |             |        |
          \___/             \      /              \        /
                             `-..-'                `.____.'

             _.-""""-._
9 lines:   .'          `.
          /              \
         |                |
         |                |
         |                |
          \              /
           `._        _.'
              `-....-'
</pre>

<p>That's the basic characters, and what you can do with them. Play with
them, see what patterns and ascii scribbles you can make. Have a go at
taking one of my pics, or another ascii pic from some of the excellent
sites around, and copy it. Then change it! See how you can use the
characters to make the picture look different. Can you make the
expression on a face change? Can you make an ascii person fatter,
thinner, taller, shorter? Give Barney the dinosaur a moustache, or,
much better, multiple wounds?  :-) This is how I learned. Many of my
first efforts were absolutely dreadful. So I looked at how someone
else had made the same sort of picture and learned from it. And I
still do - probably why people often say my style is very similar to
Joan Stark's!

</p><p>To get you started, cut and paste this head into wherever you want to
draw your ascii, and give it a face. Add a hat or a body. Or make the
hair shorter or longer. Make it a clown or a devil!

</p><pre>           ,-.,~~.
         ,'///||\\`.
        ///(((||)))\\.
       (((         )))
       _)))        |(_
      ._//\       /\\_.
      `-'_/`-._.-'\-`-'
        ' \/=._.=\/ hjw
</pre>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>That's all the boring stuff about technique over. :-) What's coming up
is a step by step demo of how I go about turning a picture into ascii.

</p><p>When you first start, it's always a good idea to try to draw something
simple. Gromit the dog is made up of very simple shapes - just ovals
and circles, so I'll use him as an example.



</p><p>To start a picture, I look for the simplest or most prominent feature
of whatever I'm trying to draw. In Gromit's case, I reckon it's his
nose. :-) I'll try the 2 line circle and see where that takes
me. After I've drawn his nose I'll see if I can draw the shape of his
head around it:
</p><pre>               ___
              /   \
             |     |
            /   _   \
            |  (_)  |
             \     /
              `---'
</pre>

<p>Hmm.. don't like that - the top of his head isn't tall enough, but if
I make it any longer it looks too …</p></div>

				<p>We’re very excited to be making a <a href="https://support.ekioh.com/download/">Flow preview</a> available for public download for the first time. Flow has a fast, modern, architecture that doesn’t share its layout engine with any other browser. While able to render most websites well, many perfectly, Flow still has some way to go. Each month more pages work, as more JavaScript APIs are added or additional CSS functionality created.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png"><img src="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png" alt="Flow running on a Raspberry Pi 400" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-768x432.png 768w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span id="more-4917"></span>We have chosen to release on just one platform initially, and there are a couple of reasons why. The Raspberry Pi’s hardware is largely fixed – you can’t swap the CPU or GPU. Variations in hardware could cause us to get distracted by issues that really shouldn’t be a priority right now.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Raspberry Pi 400 has very similar performance to many set-top box chips, so a release that demonstrates Flow’s animation performance on embedded hardware is more useful than on a PC where all browsers can easily get 60fps.</p>
<p>It’s been a year since our <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/full-google-mail-in-a-clean-room-browser/">Google Mail</a> blog post was picked up on <a href="https://twitter.com/FlowBrowser/status/1200070712121348096" data-wplink-edit="true">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Our unexpected sudden fame meant we weren’t prepared for a public browser release, and expectations were (and probably still are) unrealistically high. Most of the HTML user interfaces that we had tried rendered well, and Flow regularly outperformed other browsers on set-top boxes. But, websites never looked quite right.</p>
<p>Last September, we detailed <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/can-we-fix-it/">our work</a> on tracking down and fixing the rendering of various major websites. No one bug was particularly tricky to fix once we had narrowed it down, but the end result made the browser engine feel much more like an actual browser.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some previously working sites have stopped working due to improvements in their content, for instance, Amazon now requires Web Cryptography to log in. This is a feature currently in progress.</p>
<p>This preview has many features missing that you would reasonably expect from a browser. Media source extensions, cryptography, and CSS Grid are being actively worked on. We have plenty more to get on with, including a UI, accessibility, and better text editing functionality.</p>
<p>We generally know which sites work and which don’t, but prioritise our commercial customers. Bug fixes that impact them usually fix websites, just not necessarily your favourite website. If you are able to help us track down why a particular website (or library) fails to work, we would be very appreciative of a small test case demonstrating the bug. The more simple the test case is, the more likely we are to fix the bug. We will read all emails but, sadly, may not be able to reply.</p>
<p>And finally, while the preview is for the Raspberry Pi 400, it also works on the Raspberry Pi 4. Previous models use a different GPU with different GPU drivers, so we are holding off releasing for those until we have optimised the graphics support.</p>
<p>We hope this preview demonstrates where we are with a brand new browser engine. The feedback we get for this public preview will directly affect the prospects for desktop platforms. Enjoy it, be critical, but please don’t expect Flow to be usable on your favourite websites right now.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>You can’t really know where you are going until you know where you have been.</p>

  <p>– Maya Angelou</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cider.mx/">CIDER</a> started its life as an effort to replace a
hacked version of SLIME<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> with a proper environment for Clojure
development on Emacs. Many of you probably don’t remember those days,
but initially almost everyone was using a modified version of SLIME
for Clojure development, as there weren’t many (any?) alternatives
back in the day. The creation of CIDER was fueled mostly by the advent of
<a href="https://nrepl.org/">nREPL</a>, which was the first project that aimed to
provide a common tool-agnostic foundation for Clojure development
tools, and by the desire to address the impedance mismatch between
SLIME and Clojure.</p>

<p>CIDER was started in spring 2012 (under the name <code>nrepl.el</code>) by Phil
Hagelberg (of Leiningen fame), who hacked a prototype of an nREPL
client in Emacs Lisp on a flight to San Francisco. He got a bit stuck
on the socket-based bencode functionality and dropped it after the
flight, but not before pushing the code out and mentioning it on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2bd91de7dca55ca4">Clojure mailing
list</a>.
What followed is the best example of the power of open-source software…</p>

<p>Tim King came across Phil’s post, picked <code>nrepl.el</code> back up, and it quickly became
a respectable competitor to SLIME. The project evolved at a rapid pace
and eventually superseded SLIME in August 2012.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately in
early 2013 Tim ran out of time for nrepl.el and after another period of
stagnation, handed it over to me, as I was the main
contributor to <code>nrepl.el</code> besides him back then. I have been the project’s
steward ever since. Third time’s a charm, right?</p>

<p>My tenure at the helm started with a bit of
controversy as I renamed nrepl.el to CIDER in version 0.3 to avoid the
common case of confusion between the nREPL server and the <code>nrepl</code>
package for Emacs.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> If I have to be completely honest - I also
wanted the project to have a name as cool as SLIME, and I’m fairly
certain I succeeded in that regard.</p>

<p>Eventually CIDER became one of the most popular development
environments in the Clojure community and it spawned many important
projects (e.g. <code>cider-nrepl</code> and <code>orchard</code>), that are widely
used by other development tools (e.g. <code>vim-fireplace</code>, Conjure, <code>iced-vim</code> and Calva). My work on CIDER also led to me
becoming the maintainer of nREPL and restarting its development
after a long period of hibernation. In hindsight probably the work
I did on nREPL was even more important than the work I did on CIDER.</p>

<p>Over the years a big ecosystem of packages grew around CIDER and nREPL
and they became important parts of the Clojure development
tooling. Today CIDER and nREPL face a lot of competition, but they are still
evolving at a steady pace, occasionally innovating, and serving as inspiration for
other tools. That makes me proud of the work we’ve done over the past 8 and a half years,
even if fewer and fewer people are using CIDER and Emacs every year.</p>

<p>One thing that constantly eluded me, however, was a 1.0 release. I
guess I’m the one to blame for this not happening sooner, as I had
some really grand ambitions for CIDER 1.0 (and some rather high
quality standards to go with them) and I was optimistic that somehow my plans would
become a reality in a reasonable amount of time.  Clearly I was
mistaken. Between me having to split my time between a dozen OSS projects
and most of them currently having no other active maintainers but me,
it eventually became obvious that the grand plans will have to wait
for CIDER 2.0. Grand plans and ambitions for world domination aside,
CIDER has been pretty stable for a while now and it seems to get the
job done. And there’s also the theory that if a piece of software has
some (happy) users then it qualifies for a 1.0 release… Oh, well…</p>

<p>Today the long wait is over - <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CIDER 1.0
(“Sofia”)</a>
is officially out!<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>  There’s nothing particularly interesting in this
release - it’s almost the same as CIDER 0.26. If you notice one
difference, it would probably be that commands that act on the symbol
at point (e.g. <code>cider-doc</code>) will no longer prompt you to confirm the
symbol. The old default was a mistake and I decided to adjust it for
this grand release. If you notice another difference, it’d probably be
that CIDER is officially using SemVer now. I still have to define
what exactly is going to constitute a breaking change going forward (e.g.
are changes to keybindings breaking changes?), but I’m reasonably
sure the adherence to SemVer will make CIDER upgrades less painful
for everyone.</p>

<p>There are many things that prompted me to do the 1.0 release now, but
probably the most important factor was that 2020 was such a horrible
year for all of us. I felt we needed all the good news we could
get to counter all the pain and suffering we’ve had to endure. While I
can’t help the fight against the pandemic, I hope I can cheer you up a
bit, by delivering another iteration of your favorite software that rocks.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? I don’t really have any particular plans for CIDER 1.1, so we’ll see how exactly it’s
going to shape up. Some vague ideas that have been floating in my mind are proper support for sideloading,
adding support for dynamic middleware loading, and improvements to the session management. No promises, though.
I’m also aiming to finally do an nREPL 1.0 release at some point. There are plenty of tickets
marked with the label “Good First Issue” on CIDER’s issue tracker, so if you’re looking for
more fun challenges after the end of the “Advent of Code” be my guest. I can definitely use all the help
I can get.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, though - CIDER will always stay true to its guiding principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REPL-first (as opposed to relying on static code analysis)</li>
  <li>Community-first (CIDER is defined by its community)</li>
  <li>Keep on rocking in a Lisp world!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this article while enjoying a bottle of proper (hard) French cider, so I think
I should wrap it up before I start enjoying myself too much.
Thanks to everyone who has been a part of CIDER’s community over the years! Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the project and supported it! Thanks
to everyone who still loves Emacs and CIDER! This release is for all of you!
Cheers!</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>In this talk, I aim to report and show a collection of observations, physical, visual and other evidence of the last years incidents that strongly indicate a context of the US Central Intelligence Agency and/or potentially other entities of the US Government actions against Wikileaks and surrounding persons and organisations.</p>

<p>While the area of technical surveillance, SIGINT/COMINT and related Organizations and Methods have been more or less well understood in the hacker scene, the tactics and methods experienced and discussed in this talk are of a different type: For the moment, I would call it "initimidation surveillance" as it lacks the aspect of "covert" type of actions.</p>

<p>On the last Chaos Communication Congress, I have analysed the technical aspects of the surveillance in and surrounding the ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange stayed; this talk shows what happened to other people - friends of Assange, supporters of Wikileaks etc - not only in England, but also in other countries / other parts of the world. </p>

<p>The idea is to not only show the scope of activities but also to contribute to a better understanding of these tactics, that might be applied also in completely different political environments where governments act in extralegal ways against activities they dislike, although they that are not a crime or easily criminalized.</p>

    <p>We’re rebranding PrestoSQL as Trino. The software and the community you have come to love and depend on aren’t 
going anywhere, we are simply renaming. <strong>Trino is the new name for PrestoSQL</strong>, the project supported by the founders 
and creators of Presto® along with the major contributors – just under a shiny new name. And now you can find us here:</p>

</ul>

<p>If you want to learn why we’re doing this, read on…</p>

<p>In 2012, Dain, David and Martin joined the Facebook data infrastructure team. Together with Eric Hwang, we created 
Presto® to address the problems of low latency interactive analytics over Facebook’s massive Hadoop data warehouse. 
One of our non-negotiable conditions was for Presto® to be an open source project. Open source is in our DNA - we had 
all used and participated in open source projects to various degrees in the past, and we recognized the power of open 
communities and developers coming together to build successful software that can stand the test of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/team.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Over the next six years, we worked hard to build a healthy open source community and ecosystem around the project. We 
worked with developers and users all over the world and welcomed them into the Presto® community. Presto® was on a path 
of increasing growth and success, in large part because of the contributions from developers across many fields and all 
over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in 2018, it became clear that Facebook management wanted to have tighter control over the project and its 
future. This culminated with their decision to grant Facebook developers commit rights on the project without any prior 
experience in Presto®. We strongly believe that this kind of decision is not compatible with having a healthy, open 
community. Moreover, they made this decision by fiat without engaging the Presto® community. As a matter of principle, 
we had no choice but to leave Facebook in order to focus on making sure Presto® continued to be a successful project 
with an open, collaborative and independent community. In reality, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>We started the Presto Software Foundation in January 2019 as an independent entity to oversee the development of the 
software and community, continuing the meritocratic system that had been in place over the previous 6 years. The community 
quickly consolidated under this new home. We intentionally stayed unemployed over the next 10 months to focus on expanding 
and strengthening the community by working directly with major users and contributors, as well as reaching out to a wider 
group of users and developers across the globe. This resulted in new use cases and an injection of energy, making the 
project more vibrant than ever before as even more new users and developers became engaged. But, don’t take our word for 
it, let the data speak for itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/commits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Months after this consolidation, Facebook decided to create a competing community using The Linux Foundation®. As a first 
action, Facebook applied for a trademark on Presto®. This was a surprising, norm-breaking move because up until that point, 
the Presto® name had been used without constraints by commercial and non-commercial products for over 6 years. In September 
of 2019, Facebook established the Presto Foundation at The Linux Foundation®, and immediately began working to enforce this 
new trademark. We spent the better part of the last year trying to agree to terms with Facebook and The Linux Foundation 
that would not negatively impact the community, but unfortunately we were unable to do so. The end result is that we must 
now change the name in a short period of time, with little ability to minimize user disruption.</p>

<p>On a personal note, and as the founders who named the project Presto® in the first place, this is an incredibly sad and 
disappointing turn of events. And while we will always have fondness for the name Presto®, we have come to accept that a 
name is just a name. To be frank, we’re tired of this endless distraction, and we intend to focus on what matters most 
and what we are best at doing – building high quality software everyone can rely on and fostering a healthy community 
of users and developers that build it and support it. We’re not going anywhere – we’re the same people, the same amazing 
software, under a new name: Trino.</p>

<p><strong>If you love this project, you already love Trino. ❤️</strong></p>

    <p>2020-12-28</p>
    
<p>Hello! Welcome to the once-yearly blog post! This year I'd like to examine the
most peculiar bug I encountered at work. To set the stage, let's start with a
little background. 📚</p>
<p>When we write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URLs</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">non-standard</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">port</a> we
specify the port after a <code>:</code>. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname">hostnames</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing">IPv4</a> addresses
this is straightforward. Here's some <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> code to show how easy it is.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://node.example.com:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'node.example.com'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://192.168.0.1:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'192.168.0.1'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Addressing">IPv6</a> addresses are involved some ambiguity is introduced.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url.hostname
</span><span>'fdc8'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>url.port
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>...
Port could </span><span>not </span><span>be cast to integer value </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>'bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since IPv6 addresses use a "colon-hex" format with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> fields
separated by <code>:</code> we can't tell a port apart from a normal field. Notice in the
example above that the hostname is truncated after the first <code>:</code>, not the one
just before <code>8000</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the spec for URLs recognizes this ambiguity and gives us a way to
handle it. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt">RFC 2732 (<em>Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's</em>)</a>
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To use a literal IPv6 address in a URL, the literal address should be
enclosed in "[" and "]" characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Update our example above to include <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> and voilà! It just works.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Armed with that knowledge we can dive into the problem. 🤿</p>

<p>A few months ago a co-worker of mine wrote a seemingly innocuous function.</p>
<pre><code><span>from </span><span>ipaddress </span><span>import </span><span>ip_address


</span><span>def </span><span>safe_host</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>): 
    </span><span>"""Surround `host` with brackets if it is an IPv6 address."""
    </span><span>try</span><span>:
        </span><span>if </span><span>ip_address(host)</span><span>.version </span><span>== </span><span>6</span><span>:
            </span><span>return </span><span>"[</span><span>{}</span><span>]"</span><span>.format(host)
    </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError</span><span>:
        </span><span>pass
    return </span><span>host
</span></code></pre>
<p>Elsewhere in the code it was invoked something like this, so that hostnames,
IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses could all be safely interpolated.</p>
<pre><code><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>"https://</span><span>{host}</span><span>:8000/some/path/"</span><span>.format(host</span><span>=</span><span>safe_host(host))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since my co-worker is awesome they wrote tests to validate their code. ✅</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_hostname</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""Hostnames should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"node.example.com"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv4_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv4 addresses should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"192.168.0.1"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"192.168.0.1"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv6_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv6 addresses should be surrounded by brackets."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>(
        </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444"</span><span>)
        </span><span>== </span><span>"[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]"
    </span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thank goodness they did. The Python 2 tests failed (<a href="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/#drop-python2">don't look at me like
that</a> 😒).</p>
<pre><code><span>✖ </span><span>FAIL</span><span> py27 in </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>83</span><span> seconds
✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py36 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>82</span><span> seconds

✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py39 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>461</span><span> seconds
</span></code></pre>
<p>Both the hostname and IPv6 address tests failed. But <em><strong>why</strong></em> did they fail?
And why did the Python 3 tests pass? 🤔</p>
<p>We'll start with the hostname failure and try to isolate the bug.</p>
<pre><code><span>E       </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>: </span><span>assert </span><span>'[node.example.com]' </span><span>== </span><span>'node.example.com'
</span><span>E         </span><span>- </span><span>[node.example.com]
E         ? </span><span>-                -
</span><span>E         </span><span>+ </span><span>node.example.com
</span></code></pre>
<p>The failure says <code>node.example.com</code> was surrounded by brackets, but that's
only supposed to happen for IPv6 addresses! Let's crack open a Python 2
interpreter for a quick sanity check.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)</span><span>.version
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre><img src="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/confused-jeff-bridges.webp" alt="Confused Jeff Bridges">

<p>If, like Jeff Bridges, you were confused by that result, <em>relax</em>. We're
probably not in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro_World">Bizarro World</a> where <code>node.example.com</code> is a valid IPv6
address. There must be an explanation for this behavior.</p>
<p>Things start to become a little more clear when we see the result of the
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.0/Lib/ipaddress.py#L27-L54"><code>ip_address()</code></a> function for ourselves.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>At first glance that looks like madness. Python 3 behaves in an entirely
different manner.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>... 
</span><span>'node.example.com' </span><span>does </span><span>not </span><span>appear to be an IPv4 </span><span>or </span><span>IPv6 address
</span></code></pre>
<p>Python 3 knows that's not an IPv6 address, so why doesn't Python 2? The answer
is in how differently the two Python versions handle text.</p>

<p>Computers don't operate on text as humans think of it. They operate on numbers.
That's part of why we have IP addresses to begin with. In order to represent
human-readable text with computers we had to assign meaning to the numbers.
Thus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> was born.</p>
<p>ASCII is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">character encoding</a>, which means it specifies how to interpret
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a> as text we understand (provided you speak English). So, when your
computer sees <code>01101110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> (<code>110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">decimal</a>) you see <code>n</code> because
that's what ASCII says it is.</p>
<p>You can see the number to text conversion in action right in the Python
interpreter.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ord</span><span>(</span><span>"n"</span><span>)
</span><span>110
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>In fact, it doesn't matter what numbering system you use. If you specify
binary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">octal</a>, decimal, hexadecimal, whatever... If it can be understood as
the right integer it will be displayed correctly.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0b01101110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0o156</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0x6e</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Neat, but what does that information do for us?</p>

<p>Just for giggles, humor me and let's look at the character-number translations
for <code>node.example.com</code>. We'll leave out binary and octal, because they make
this table uglier than it already is.</p>

<p>Hey, hold on a second... If you tilt your head sideways and squint that last
row looks kinda like an IPv6 address, doesn't it?</p>
<p>We should verify, just to be absolutely certain. You've still got that Python 2

</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, when you boil them both down to numbers they're the same mess of
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>If we dig into the source code for the Python 2 version of the
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py"><code>ipaddress</code></a> module we ultimately come to a
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py#L2026-L2031">curious set of lines</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span># Constructing from a packed address
</span><span>if </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)</span><span>:
    </span><span>self._check_packed_address(address, </span><span>16</span><span>)

    self</span><span>._ip </span><span>= </span><span>_compat_int_from_byte_vals(bvs, </span><span>'big'</span><span>)
    </span><span>return
</span></code></pre>
<p>It turns out that, under certain conditions, the <code>ipaddress</code> module can create
IPv6 addresses from raw bytes. My assumption is that it offers this behavior as
a convenient way to parse IP addresses from data fresh off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_data">wire</a>.</p>
<p>Does <code>node.example.com</code> meet those certain conditions? You bet it does. Because
we're using Python 2 it's just <code>bytes</code> and it happens to be 16 characters long.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># `self._check_packed_address` basically just checks how long it is.
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>16
True
</span></code></pre>
<p>The rest of the <code>ipaddress</code> lines say to interpret the sequence of bytes as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> integer. That's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/struct.html#struct.unpack">magic</a> best left
for another blog post, but the gist is that hexadecimal interpretation of
<code>node.example.com</code> is condensed into a single, <strong>huge</strong> number.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>"6e6f64652e6578616d706c652e636f6d"</span><span>, </span><span>16</span><span>)
</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's an absolutely massive number, but not so massive it won't fit within the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Larger_address_space">IPv6 address space</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ip_address(</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As it turns out, if you're liberal in your interpretation, <code>node.example.com</code>
<em>can</em> be an IPv6 address!</p>

<p>Obviously that's hogwash. Bizarro might be proud, but that's not what we wanted
to happen.</p>
<p>There's a quote about numbers which is apocryphally attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois">W.E.B. Du
Bois</a>, but that actually comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen">Harold Geneen</a>'s book,
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen"><em>Managing</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have mastered the numbers, you will in fact no longer be reading
numbers, any more than you read words when reading a book. You will be
reading meanings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having not read the book I'm probably taking the quote way out of context, but
I think it fits our situation well.</p>
<p>As we've seen above, we can freely convert characters to numbers and back
again. The root of our problem is that when we use Python 2 it considers text
to be bytes. There's not a deeper, inherent meaning. Maybe the bytes are meant
to be ASCII, maybe they're meant to be a long number, maybe they're meant to be
an IP address. The interpretation of those bytes is up to us.</p>
<p>Python 2 doesn't differentiate between bytes and text by default. In fact, the
<code>bytes</code> type is just an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3112-byte-literals">alias</a> for <code>str</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>type </span><span>'str'</span><span>&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes </span><span>is </span><span>str
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>To make that even more concrete, see how Python 2 considers <code>n</code> to be the same
as this sequence of raw bytes.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>"n" </span><span>== </span><span>b</span><span>"\x6e"
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our Python 2 code doesn't work the way we want it to because raw bytes can have
arbitrary meaning and we haven't told it to use our intended meaning.</p>
<p>So now we know why Python 2 interprets <code>node.example.com</code> as an IPv6 address,
but why does Python 3 behave differently? More importantly, how can we
reconcile the two?</p>

<p>ASCII looked like a good idea in the 1960's. With decades of hindsight we
know the 256 characters …</p></article></main></div></div>
