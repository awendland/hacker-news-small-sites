		<p>
I am often asked what I mean when I say that developers spend most of their time figuring the system out. Let’s unpack the statement.
</p>
<p>
The oldest reference on the topic I know of dates back to 1979 in a book by Zelkowitz, Shaw, and Gannon entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-software-engineering-design-Prentice-Hall/dp/013710202X">Principles of software engineering and design</a>. It said that most of the development time was spent on maintenance (67%).
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Software development costs (1979)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Granted, the book does not specify how the figure was obtained. Still, it was deemed an important enough problem to attract significant research attention since then.
</p>
<p>
So, how far are we now, more than 4 decades later?
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at a recent paper by Xia, Bao, Lo, Xing, Hassan, &amp; Li entitled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318811113_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_A_Large-Scale_Field_Study_with_Professionals">Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals</a> and published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 44, 951-976, 2018. This paper is quite interesting in that it describes in great details how the figures are obtained. And it says that Comprehension took on average ~58%.
</p>
<p>
Now, take a closer look at the results table.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/2018-costs.png" alt="Software development costs (2018)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (2018)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In particular, take a look at the third column in the table: it says Navigation accounts for 24% of the effort, and that is considered separately from the Comprehension effort!
</p>
<p>
So, after 4 decades, we can observe that not much has changed beside learning how to measure the “figuring out” time.
</p>
<p>
So what?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out" time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
</p>
<p>
If we do talk about how the “figuring out the system” time is spent, we notice that people spend it reading. In fact, as the above paper also shows, comprehension is essentially measured as reading! The two are considered as mostly synonymous.
</p>
<p>
So, how should we talk about how we figure the system out?
</p>
<p>
Given that not much happened for 4 decades, we should entertain the idea that maybe we should frame the problem differently. 
</p>
<p>
Please, bear with me. This is where it gets interesting. So, why do developers read code? Because they want to figure the situation enough to know what to do next. The intent is important. This is decision making.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/decision-making.png" alt="The figuring out time is a decision making time">
	<figcaption>The figuring out time is a decision making time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
From this perspective, reading is just the means through which information is gathered from data. It also happens to be the most manual possible way to do that, so this lends itself to an important opportunity for optimization.
</p>
<p>
Before you can do something significant about anything, you have to name it. Otherwise it's like with Voldemort. <a href="http://humane-assessment.com/">Many winters ago</a>, I called the effort of “figuring the system out to know what to do next" assessment. And I claimed we should optimize development around it.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/assessment.png" alt="Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision">
	<figcaption>Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
For a whole decade my colleagues and I explored this idea. And it led us to what we now call moldable development.
</p>
<p>
What’s that?
</p>
<p>
Reading is the most manual way to extract information out of data. It does not scale and leads to incomplete information &amp; uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Software is hard enough. Not knowing what the current system is like should not be an acceptable variable in the equation. A hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering.
</p>
<p>
Once we accept that systems are data, it becomes obvious we should approach it like data, too. Data science tells us that you first start from the problem and then reason through a tool that matches the context.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/molding.png" alt="Tools should match the context">
	<figcaption>Tools should match the context</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
 As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems. To handle this, the key idea of moldable development is that the tool should be moldable after knowing the problem. In this way it can deal with what's important in context, and because of it, it can take care of the boring part of reading. Of course, for this to be practical, the cost of creating custom tools must be small.
</p>
<p>
I see the flow of constructing custom tools during development, and, ideally, for every single development problem, as the next major leap in software development.
</p>
<p>
In a decade from now, we should not be measuring the "figuring the system out” in terms of reading. We should occupy our energy with solving actual problems. To get there we should start by talking about how not to read code. We cannot afford not to.
</p>
<p>
We created <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to provide a concrete start for the "how not to read code" conversation. Glamorous Toolkit is a moldable development environment that makes it possible to create custom tools about software systems inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
So, go to <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">gtoolkit.com</a>. Play with it. Feel #MoldableDevelopment.
</p>
<p>
And do engage with us: <a href="https://discord.gg/FTJr9gP">discord.gg/FTJr9gP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s make that conversation happen.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Earlier this week, Twitter announced an initiative to combat misinformation on their platform that they call <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html">Birdwatch</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126122026/https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/overview/">How Birdwatch works</a>: Volunteers sign up (assuming they meet all the requirements) and can add notes to fill in context on misleading tweets. Other users can rate these contextual tweets as helpful or not helpful. All of these “notes” and ratings of notes are completely transparent.</p>











<p>At its face, Birdwatch is an attempt to scale up the existing fact-checking capability used during the 2020 U.S. Elections while also crowdsourcing this decision-making.</p>



<p>I will give Twitter credit for two things, and only two things, before I get into the problems with their design.</p>



<ol><li>They’re distributing the power to fact-check bad tweets to their users rather than hoarding it for themselves.</li><li>They correctly emphasized transparency as a goal for this tool.</li></ol>



<p>But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>



<h2>The Fatal Flaw of Birdwatch’s Design</h2>



<p>There’s an old essay titled <em><a href="https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/">The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security</a></em>, that immediately identifies two problems with Birdwatch’s design. They also happen to be the first two items on the essay’s list!</p>



<ol><li><strong>Default Permit</strong></li><li><strong>Enumerating Badness</strong></li></ol>



<p>This is best illustrated by way of example.</p>



<p>Let’s assume there are two pathological liars hellbent on spreading misinformation on Twitter. They each tweet unsubstantiated claims about some facet of government or civil service. Birdwatch users catch only one of them, and correctly fact-check their tweet.</p>



<p>What happens to the other liar?</p>



<p>What happens if Birdwatch users can only identify one out of ten liars? One out of a hundred? One out of a thousand?! Et cetera.</p>







<p>To be clear: The biggest flaw in their product design is simply that their “notes” and “fact-checks” are negative indicators on known-bad tweets.</p>



<p>This will create a dark pattern: If a tweet slips past the Birdwatch users’ radars, it won’t be fact-checked. In turn, users won’t realize it’s misinformation. A popular term for the resulting conduct is <strong>coordinated inauthentic behavior</strong>.</p>



<p>This already happens to YouTube.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PGm8LslEb4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Hell, this is already happening <em>to Twitter</em>:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-1RhQ1uuQ4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<h2>How To Fix Birdwatch</h2>



<p>I wrote an entire essay on <a href="https://medium.com/@soatok/defeating-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-at-scale-a872badf721">Defeating Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior at Scale</a> in 2019. I <em>highly</em> recommend anyone at Twitter interested in actually solving the misinformation problem to give that a careful consideration.</p>







<p>But in a nutshell, the most important fix is to change the state machine underlying Birdwatch from:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; trustworthy</li><li>Notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul>



<p>…to something <em>subtly</em> different:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; unvetted / be cautious</li><li>Notes -&gt;<ul><li>Negative notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul><ul><li>Positive notes -&gt; verified by experts</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>This effectively creates a traffic light signal for users: Tweets start as yellow (exercise caution, which is the default) and may become green (affirmed by notes) or red (experts disagree).</p>



<h3>What Would This Change Accomplish?</h3>



<p>Malicious actors that accomplish Birdwatch evasion will only manage to encompass their message in caution tape. (Metaphorically speaking, anyway.)</p>



<p>If their goal is to spread misinformation while convincing the recipients of their message that they’re speaking the truth, they’ll have to get a green light–which is ideally more expensive to accomplish.</p>



<h3>Bonus Round</h3>



<p>I would also recommend some kind of “this smells fishy” button to signal Birdwatch contributors that this tweet needs fact-checking. Users might self-select into filter bubbles that Birdwatch users are totally absent from, and in turn come across things that are completely unvetted and possibly ambiguous.</p>



<p>While I have your attention, here’s a quality of life suggestion, on the house:</p>



<p>Being able to link claims together (e.g. reposted images with a false claim, n.b. like how the minions memes on Facebook) to deduplicate their claims about reality would save a lot of unnecessary headache.</p>



<p>(Anyone who has used Stack Overflow will appreciate the utility of being able to say “this is a duplicate of $otherThing”.)</p>



<h2>What If These Fundamental Flaws Remain Unfixed?</h2>



<p>Although Birdwatch will probably meet the immediate goal of scaling up the fact-checking efforts beyond what Twitter can provide (and satisfy the public relations requirements of tangibly doing <em>something</em> to combat this problem), propagandists and conspiracy theorists will simply become incentivized to evade Birdwatch contributors’ detection while spreading their lies.</p>



<p>As I said above, coordinated inauthentic behavior is already happening. This isn’t some abstract threat that only academics care about.</p>



<p>To the aid of the malicious, most users will confuse tweets that evaded detection with tweets that didn’t warrant correction. This might even lead to users trusting misinformation <em>more</em> than they would before Birdwatch. This would be a total self-own for the entire Birdwatch project.</p>

<![CDATA[Fix Terminals]]>

January 27, 2021 | http://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pagebody">



<p>
Keyboard input on Terminals has many deficiencies to it. I want them all fixed. I have a plan on how to do it but it Needs Your Help
</p>

<p>
I want terminal keypresses to Just Work. What do I mean Just Work? I mean programs in a simple orthogonal way, can determine the key that was pressed, and this model should easily map to the user's expectation.
</p>

<p>
Why doesn't it currently? Currently, there are a number of classes of physically-distinct key presses that terminals encode using the same bytes.

</p><ul>
<li>Special names for some ASCII characters collide with <tt>Ctrl</tt>-modified letters. For example, <tt>Tab</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-I</tt>.</li>
<li>The <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier encodes lower or upper-case letters identically; <tt>Ctrl-I</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-Shift-I</tt>.</li>
<li>UTF-8 collides with 8bit-high characters; e.g. <tt>Alt-C</tt> might be encoded as <tt>0xc3</tt>, which is the first UTF-8 byte of many Unicode characters, such as Ã©.</li>
<li>Sometimes programs rely on timing information to distinguish, for example, <tt>Alt-C</tt> from the two separate keypresses of <tt>Escape</tt> followed by <tt>C</tt>. This results in delays to recognise a plain <tt>Escape</tt> key if the time is too long, or erroneously recognising <tt>Escape</tt> followed by a letter as an <tt>Alt</tt>-modified letter if typed too quickly, or if the time limit is too short.</li>
</ul><p>

Even when keys produce unique unambiguous byte sequences, it may be that some programs cannot recognise them.
</p><ul>
<li>The way terminals encode modified keypresses is an extension to the original methods used in the 1970s, and some older code cannot parse them correctly. Press <tt>Ctrl-Up</tt> on a modern xterm and watch a program fail and die in all sorts of interesting ways because they don't have real CSI parsers.</li>
</ul>



<h2>How can we fix this?</h2>

<p>
By having a sane and sensible model on BOTH ends of the terminal interaction, and a well-defined way of communicating.
How exactly we go about this really depends who you are:
</p>

<h3>Authors of Programs that Read Terminal Keypresses</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to go about this is to use the key input handling features of my terminal UI library, <a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtickit/">libtickit</a>.
Failing this, if you're using some existing system of keyboard input, such as GNU Readline, I suggest you apply pressure to the maintainers of that system until they adopt this method of reading extended keypresses.
</p>

<h3>Authors of Terminal Emulators</h3>

<p>
Making a terminal send the correct key encodings should be a relatively easy task, given the encoding scheme already splits modifiers and keysyms in a way likely to be similar to the underlying input system at work, such as X11 or Win32.
</p>

<h3>End-users of Programs</h3>

<p>Even if you're not the author of a program like this, you can still help fix the situation. Write to the maintainer of your program, report a bug. Explain that you wanted to use such a keybinding, or whatever the problem was. Explain that, because their program doesn't correctly handle these cases, it wasn't possible, but if they were to adopt this scheme, then it would be and your problem would be solved. With enough voices, even the most stubbon developer who believes it's 1970 and everyone lives behind a green-phosphor glass teletype on a 9,600 baud modem, can still change his ways.</p>

<h2>Encoding Specification</h2>

<p>
The primary motivation of this scheme is to encode any possible keypress uniquely; that a keypress maps to one possible sequence of bytes, and a valid sequence of bytes encodes only one keypress. For backward compability, it is also required that any keypress that can be represented without this scheme is also represented by the same bytes within it; that is, this scheme is an <em>extension</em> of existing encodings, not a replacement of.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Modifiers</dt>
<dd>
The two encoding forms used by this specification to encode modifiers both put a number as their second parameter whose value is 1 + a bitmask encoding the modifiers. We add 1 because by convention, a missing CSI parameter is equivalent to 1, so in the "unmodified" state the modifier field would be 1 - we must add 1 to it so that no-bits-set (unmodified) is encoded as 1 (though, in practice, we rarely use the 1 form explicitly).<br>

Thus, the various encoding forms using these modifiers will look like:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>unmodified</td><td>Shift+</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Alt+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+</td></tr>
<tr><td>(direct UTF-8)</td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 u</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI ... ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 ~</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;2 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;3 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;4 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;5 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;6 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;7 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;8 X</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
These various forms are explained more below.
</dd>

<dt>Unicode Characters</dt>
<dd>
When unmodified, just send UTF-8 bytes as normal. No UTF-8 sequence of a regular character starts with a <tt>C0</tt> or <tt>C1</tt> byte, so these will be unique. The <tt>Shift</tt> key should not be considered as a modifier for Unicode characters, because it is most likely used to obtain the character in the first place (e.g. the shift key is often required to obtain the <tt>!</tt> symbol).<br>

Certain key presses have special behaviours with modifiers. <tt>Alt</tt> tends to prefix <tt>Escape</tt>. <tt>Ctrl</tt> tends to mask with <tt>0x1f</tt>. When the simplest form of these keys are pressed, they should be encoded as previously.
Existing schemes lack a way to encode more general modifiers with Unicode codepoints at present, so we are at liberty to invent something new for these. The CSI <tt>u</tt> command lies in the private-use area, so has no fixed meaning at present.
<pre>CSI [codepoint];[modifier] u</pre>
We can use this to represent the problematic combinations of keys; for example variations on the letter "A" (ASCII decimal value 65) and "a":
<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><td>unmodified</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td></tr>
<tr><td>without Shift</td><td><tt>a</tt></td><td><tt>ESC a</tt></td><td><tt>0x01</tt></td><td><tt>ESC 0x01</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>with Shift</td><td><tt>A</tt></td><td><tt>ESC A</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;7 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
This same pattern is continued for the other letters, except for the awkward cases of 

We can now represent the usual problematic keys unambiguously:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-I = <tt>CSI 105;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-I = <tt>CSI  73;5 u</tt></td><td>Tab        = <tt>0x09</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-M = <tt>CSI 109;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-M = <tt>CSI  77;5 u</tt></td><td>Enter      = <tt>0x0d</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-[ = <tt>CSI  91;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-{       = <tt>CSI 123;5 u</tt></td><td>Escape     = <tt>0x1b</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Ctrl-@ = <tt>CSI  64;5u</tt></td>                                 <td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Because other <tt>C0</tt> bytes do not have usual alternative names or keypresses, these can continue to be sent using the simple single-byte encoding. This is essential to ensuring that legacy systems continue to interpret them correctly (e.g. <tt>termios</tt> still sends <tt>SIGINT</tt> on Ctrl-C).
The <tt>Space</tt> key is unique among the printing Unicode keys in that its behaviour doesn't normally change as a result of the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier. We can capture this by encoding it using CSIu - uniquely, the only printing Unicode key for which we use this:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI 32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Modified C0 controls</dt>
<dd>
The problematic keys listed above plus <tt>Backspace</tt> can be represented using the <tt>CSI u</tt> encoding when any modifiers are present. Because these symbols are almost universally found on their own physical keycap, there is no problem with encoding the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier as well, with the value 1. We encode these keys using their normal <tt>ASCII</tt> codepoint values.

<tbody><tr><td>Enter     = <tt>0x0d</tt></td><td>Shift-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;5 u</tt></td><td rowspan="4">...</td></tr>

<tr><td>Backspace = <tt>0x7f</tt></td><td>Shift-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;5 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
The <tt>Space</tt> key is trickier, because it's traditionally used with the <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier to obtain the <tt>NUL</tt> byte encoding.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Space     = <tt>0x20</tt></td><td>Shift-Space     = <tt>CSI  32;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Space     = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI  32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Since most terminals repesent <tt>Shift-Tab</tt> as <tt>CSI Z</tt>, that needs handling specially as well.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Tab = <tt>0x09</tt></td><td>Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI  Z</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Tab = <tt>CSI 9;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI 1;5 Z</tt></td><td>...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Special keys</dt>
<dd>
Existing schemes usually use <tt>CSI ~</tt> to encode special (i.e. non-Unicode) keypresses. XTerm and other terminals use the second CSI parameter to pass encoding the set of modifiers in effect.
<pre>CSI [number];[modifier] ~</pre>
If the modifier value is 1; i.e. there are no modifiers, then for backward-compatibility to send the same bytes as previously, it should be omitted, sending simply
<pre>CSI [number] ~</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Number</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Insert   </td><td> 2</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Delete   </td><td> 3</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Up  </td><td> 5</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Down</td><td> 6</td></tr>

 <tr><td>F11      </td><td>23</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F12      </td><td>24</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<b>(*)</b>: Note that some terminals prefer to encode <tt>Home</tt>, <tt>End</tt> and the <tt>F1</tt> to <tt>F4</tt> function keys using shorter <tt>CSI letter</tt> encodings. Parsers or other receiving programs should accept either encoding identically.
<b>(**)</b>: Note also the discontinuity of numbered function keys. After every group of 5 F keys there is a missing number; so every 6th number is not used by an F key (10, 16, 22, 28,...). This is purely for historic reasons; the numbered F keys on the original VTxx keyboards had physical gaps in these locations.
</dd>

<dt>Really special keypresses</dt>
<dd>
Some terminals encode certain keys outside of the <tt>CSI ~</tt> encoding, instead picking a different CSI command. This too can accomodate the modifier in its second position.
<pre>CSI 1;[modifier] {ABCDFHPQRS}</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Code</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Up</td>   <td>A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Down</td> <td>B</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Right</td><td>C</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Left</td> <td>D</td></tr>
 <tr><td>End</td>  <td>F</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Home</td> <td>H</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F1</td>   <td>P</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F2</td>   <td>Q</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F3</td>   <td>R</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F4</td>   <td>S</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
As before, if the modifier is 1 then the modifier parameter should be omitted. Since the leading number is also implied, this can be omitted too.
<pre>CSI {ABCDFHPQRS}</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Advantages: solves above problems. <b>Can be fitted into existing programs with a minimum of fuss and without breaking back-compat</b>.
</p>

<p>
Extension: We can take it one step further, and require CSI to be sent as the single 8bit code <tt>0x9b</tt> and never as 7bit multibyte <tt>0x1b 0x4b</tt> (Escape [). This reserves the single <tt>0x1b</tt> byte exclusively for the Escape key. If this is known to be in effect, then it is no longer required to use timing information to recover accurate keypress information, as every possible keypress now has a unique encoding. Even if this is not known to be in effect, programs ought to accept the single <tt>0x9b</tt> byte encoding of CSI anyway, in anticipation of a time when terminals may send it encoded this way by default.

Call to arms for idiomatic OO code <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/call-to-arms">here</a>.</em></p><p>People bash OO a lot these days, I'm increasingly coming to the opinion they're right, at least in Python. My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se, more that its introduction is simply unnecessary, AKA not useful.</p><h2>Oli's Conjecture</h2><blockquote>All OO code can be refactored into equivalent non-OO code that's as easy or more easy to understand.</blockquote><p>Let's take an example that should pan out in OO's favour, we've all seen/written code somewhat like the following:</p><pre><code>class ApiClient:
    def __init__(self, root_url: str, session_cls: sessionmaker):
        self.root_url = root_url
        self.session_cls = session_cls

    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/v1/{entity}"

    def get_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
        resp = requests.get(self.construct_url(entity))
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]

    def save_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; None:
        with scoped_session(self.session_cls) as session:
            session.add(self.get_items(entity))


class ClientA(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/{entity}"


class ClientB(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}"


client_a = ClientA("https://client-a", session_cls)
client_a.save_items("bars")</code></pre><p>We chose OO it because we wanted to bind the <code>root_url</code> to something and we didn't want to pass around the <code>sessionmaker</code>. We also wanted to utilise inheritance to hook into a method halfway through the call stack.</p><p>But what if we do just pass data around, and write 'boring' functions, what happens then?</p><pre><code>@dataclass
class Client:
    root_url: str
    url_layout: str


client_a = Client(
    root_url="https://client-a",
    url_layout="{root_url}/{entity}",
)

client_b = Client(
    root_url="https://client-b",
    url_layout="{root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}",
)


def construct_url(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; str:
    return client.url_layout.format(root_url=client.root_url, entity=entity)


def get_items(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
    resp = requests.get(construct_url(client, entity))
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]


def save_items(client: Client, session_cls: session_cls, entity: str) -&gt; None:
    with scoped_session(session_cls) as session:
        session.add(get_items(client, entity))


save_items(client_a, session_cls, "bars")</code></pre><p>We had to pass round the <code>Client</code> and the <code>session_cls</code> around.</p><p>ðŸ¤·</p><p>Who cares? We even wrote like 10% fewer characters. Also, the conjecture stands, the resulting code is at least as easy to understand and we didn't need any OO.</p><p>I've heard this style referred to as the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style. That is to say, all your code just consists of typed data and module-namespaced-bags-of-functions.</p><h2>What about long lived global-y things?</h2><p>Use <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/sane-config.html">this pattern</a> to reuse config/db session classes over the lifetime of an application.</p><h2>What about interfaces/abstract base classes?</h2><p>Just try writing without them, I promise it's going to be OK. <em>(To be fair, it's only the introduction of type hints to Python that has made the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style so pleasant).</em></p><h2>What about impure things?</h2><p>If you've taken the pure-FP/hexagonal-architecture pill, you want to write pure classes that take impure 'adapter' instances for <code>getting-the-current-datetime/API-calls/talking-to-the-db/other-impure-stuff</code>. The idea is nice in principal - should be good for testing right? - in practice, you can just use <a href="https://github.com/spulec/freezegun">freezegun</a> / use <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/responses">responses</a> / <a href="https://dhh.dk/2014/slow-database-test-fallacy.html">test with the db</a> (the <code>other-impure-stuff</code> tends to not actually exist) and save yourself a lot of hassle.</p><h2>Exceptions:</h2><p>I'd like to make exceptions for the following:</p><ul><li>You'll notice I put <code>@dataclass</code>s in the refactored code, these are fine - they're just record types. Python 5 will only have these, not 'normal' classes.</li><li>It's fine to subclass <code>Exception</code>s.  The usage of <code>try: ... except SomeClass: ...</code> fundamentally ties you to a heirarchical worldview, this is fine, just don't make it too complicated.</li><li><code>Enum</code>s - same as above, they fit in well with the rest of Python.</li><li>Very, very occasionally (at least in application development), you come up with a core type that's used so often, it's nice to have the cutesy stuff - think something like a <code>pandas.DataFrame</code>/<code>sqlalchemy.Session</code>. In general though, don't kid yourself that you're building anything that exciting, it's just vanity getting the better of you.</li></ul><h2>I lied.</h2><blockquote>My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se.</blockquote><p>OK, I lied, it's not just a case of OO being a largely futile addition to the language, it's that it often obscures the problem at hand and encourages bad behaviours:</p><ul><li>It encourages you to mutate. Bag-of-functions makes it feel icky to mutate arguments - as it should feel. (Feel free to mutate within the confines of your function BTW, let's not go mad FP).</li><li>It's somewhat just the return of global variables. Not being able to share data between functions with <code>self</code> forces you to write functions with a smaller state-space that are easier to test.</li><li>Smooshing in functions in with your data makes it harder to serialise anything - in a world of REST APIs, serialisability is super useful.</li><li>It encourages mad inheritance hierarchies - this has been talked about at length elsewhere.</li><li>Most importantly though, it adds nothing, it's just noise that distracts from the problem at hand and makes it harder to navigate/comprehend your code.</li></ul><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li><a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/poor-mans-object.html">I've written before about the poor man's object/closure thingy.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0">A classic video in the OO-bashing genre.</a></li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOCs</a>. Theyâ€™re great for trying to learn a new programming language (e.g., Python, Scala) or framework (e.g., Spark, TensorFlow) or subject (e.g., statistics, machine learning). The structured learning environment, excellent teaching, and exercises (and solutions) guide us through the best way to learn new concepts.</p>
<p><strong>But most of the time, we donâ€™t really need it.</strong> If we <em>already</em> know machine learning, taking that shiny new MOOC wonâ€™t help with applying it more effectively. Doing another Python tutorial wonâ€™t help with writing better code. Most MOOCs follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a> and teach students the 20% they need to achieve 80% results. Thus, past the first or second course, our learning tapers off. (Also see Susanâ€™s view on <a href="https://www.susanshu.com/should-i-take-more-online-courses-data-science#rule-of-thumb-diminishing-marginal-returns" target="_blank">diminishing returns</a>.)</p><p>
\[\text { Diminishing returns from similar MOOCs }=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots \approx 2\]
</p><p><strong>Sometimes, new MOOCs become a reason to procrastinate, or worse, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping" target="_blank">self-handicap</a>.</strong> You know this is happening when you hear yourself, or something else, having these thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>â€œIâ€™m not able to start building that <em>until</em> I finish this MOOC specialization.â€�</li>
<li>â€œMy resume isnâ€™t getting picked up <em>because</em> I donâ€™t have certs on Spark &amp; PyTorch.â€�</li>
<li>â€œI havenâ€™t studied enough about deep learning, <em>so</em> I wonâ€™t do well in the interview.â€�</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watching lecture videos isnâ€™t learningâ€”itâ€™s passive consumption.</strong> We sometimes equate taking an MOOC, or reading a technical book cover to cover, with learning the material. But how often do we struggle when we try to apply the technical knowledge or skills at work? Children donâ€™t learn to ride bicycles via how-to videos. Similarly, we canâ€™t learn how to program or apply technical knowledge just solely watching videos.</p>
<h2 id="go-off-the-happy-path">Go off the happy path</h2>
<p>Most good MOOCs or tutorials will provide hands-on practice. However, that hands-on practice will lie on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path" target="_blank">happy path</a>. We can copy-paste the code and itâ€™ll work. This makes sense as thereâ€™s a lot of material to cover and we donâ€™t want to spend time debugging, doing prep work, or solving problems via trial and error. Students will lose patience, causing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/60e90be2-1a77-11e9-b191-175523b59d1d" target="_blank">completion rates to drop</a>.</p>
<p>Being on the happy path makes it easier to complete MOOC after MOOC. However, when we try to apply what weâ€™ve learnedâ€”either at work or on a personal projectâ€”it becomes much harder. This is because weâ€™re <em>now</em> off the happy path. And this is a good thing!</p>
<p><strong>Going off the happy path is how we further our learning <em>beyond the classroom</em>.</strong> This is especially so for our field of data science and machine learning, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-world data is messy and dirty, but most MOOCs or YouTube classes start with clean, structured data.</li>
<li>Most of the skills we require are technical. Thus, hands-on coding (read: <a href="https://danluu.com/teach-debugging/" target="_blank">debugging</a>) is essential to master them.</li>
<li>Experimentation is fundamental in our field. We need to try different approaches, fail, and learn beyond what can be practically taught in an MOOC or online tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œI hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.â€� â€“ Confucius</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We go off the happy path by doing real-world projects</strong>, dirty data, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cuda+errors" target="_blank">CUDA errors</a>, and all. Through projects, we learn how to define problems, apply algorithms wrongly (and correctly), google error messages, and iterate until it works. We practice resourcefulness, grit, and how to learn. These are the lessons that push us towards excellence.</p>
<p>But, I donâ€™t know enough to start a personal project!</p>
<h2 id="just-in-time-learning">Just-in-time learning</h2>
<p><strong>You just need to know enough to start; the rest youâ€™ll pick up along the way.</strong> We donâ€™t need to know Python <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" target="_blank">generators</a> before developing your first Python program. We donâ€™t need to know Spark before processing 2 million rows of data. We donâ€™t need to know TensorFlow before training your first machine learning model.</p>
<p><strong>Just start, and let the challenges guide you towards your next learning needs.</strong> This way, you immediately apply what youâ€™ve learned. This reinforces learning, improves retention, and increases satisfaction. Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing" target="_blank">just-in-time</a> manufacturing, just learn whateverâ€™s needed to make progress on your project. Technical skills are perishableâ€”if we donâ€™t apply what we learn, theyâ€™ll decay.</p>
<p><strong>Apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" target="_blank">YAGNI</a> to learning.</strong> Just like we donâ€™t need to add functionality until itâ€™s required, we donâ€™t need to do every new MOOC or read every new textbook. No point overwhelming ourselves with all that information and knowledge which we wonâ€™t use or apply.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to become expert at thing:<br>1 iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning â€œon demandâ€� (ie donâ€™t learn bottom up breadth wise)<br>2 teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words<br>3 only compare yourself to younger you, never to others</p>— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1325154823856033793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2020</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>To be clear, Iâ€™m not saying that we should stop exploring and learning new things. Iâ€™m saying that we should lean towards being more focused.</p>
<p>When learning about new domains, subjects, or skills, adopt a childlike <em>exploratory</em> mindset. Donâ€™t concern ourselves with the practicality of what we learn. However, if our intent is mastery, we should adopt a <em>focused</em> mindset and learn via hands-on projects, mistakes, and feedback.</p>
<h2 id="but-but-here-are-my-reasons-for-_____">But, butâ€¦ here are my reasons for _____</h2>
<p>I often get pushback when I suggest doing a personal project instead of another MOOC, Kaggle, or further education. Hereâ€™s how some conversations go:</p>
<p><strong>â€œIâ€™m very time-constrained and donâ€™t have time for a personal project. MOOCs are self-contained and need only 2-4 hours a weekâ€�</strong></p>
<p>Yes, MOOCs are great return on time-invested for getting up to speed on a subject. But past a certain threshold of knowledge and understanding, youâ€™re going to need hands-on practice to take your learning further. AFAIK, projects are the best way to do this.</p>
<p><strong>â€�I tried doing a personal project in the past. But I got a lot of errors and had to google a lotâ€”I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ready for them until I do more MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Getting errors and googling for help is perfectly normal! Even the instructors who created those MOOCs do that too. Thatâ€™s how we learnâ€”by trying, failing, and overcoming.</p>
<p><strong>â€�Personal projects are too difficult. Taking an MOOC is easier.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Thatâ€™s exactly why you need to do a personal project. The difficulty you experience is the learning curveâ€”without it, thereâ€™s no learning.</p>
<p>MOOCs <em>feel</em> easier because their tutorials and assignments are structured to follow the happy path. But this means youâ€™re deliberately steered away from the hairy issues that youâ€™ll face in the real world, unlike in a personal project.</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/mooc-jackie.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Why I can't serve ML models?!" alt="Why I can't serve ML models?!"></p>
<p><strong>â€�Doing that MOOC/Masters gives me a certificate that helps my resume.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. Nonetheless, companies are placing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html" target="_blank">less emphasis on educational qualifications</a>, even for technical roles. Recruiters and hiring managers are also becoming more open-minded. And in the end, from a hiring managerâ€™s perspective, what <em>really</em> counts is if you can do the work, not that cert.</p>
<p><strong>â€�The recruiter said I would be tested on technical skills and knowledge. Thus, I need to do more technical MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>To an extent, MOOCs and YouTube videos are helpful, especially for questions that test your knowledge (read: memory) or require you to know the trick (e.g., leetcode type questions).</p>
<p>However, for most interviews, youâ€™ll likely get more nebulous tasks, like designing a data pipeline, whiteboarding a machine learning API, or coding up a basic k-nearest neighbors or decision tree. These assess your ability to design and develop maintainable systems, think through edge cases, and adapt based on feedback. The hands-on practice from projects will be more helpful in such interviews</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/interview-board.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Lets just focus on the easy questions" alt="Lets just focus on the easy questions"></p>
<p><strong>â€�What personal project should I do?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Start with something youâ€™re interested in. If youâ€™re not intrinsically interested in it, you might find difficulty finishing.</p>
<p>Aim for something you can complete over the weekends in 12 weeks, ideally, 6 - 8 weeks. Any longer and it wonâ€™t seem urgent enough (and youâ€™ll lose momentum).</p>
<p><strong>â€�Iâ€™m familiar with web scraping/ruby/excel, can my personal project be about that?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Just start somewhere and evolve it along the way.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if youâ€™re doing a personal project to learn, youâ€™ll probably want to deliberately pick something new and unfamiliar. Or if youâ€™re doing a personal project to build your portfolio (and get a job), youâ€™ll want to look over the job requirements to make sure you address them.</p>
<p><strong>â€�But, I canâ€™t think of any interesting personal projects!â€�</strong></p>
<p>Look back on the classes and material youâ€™ve covered. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find something interesting that youâ€™ll want to dig deeper into.</p>
<p>This is also a good test of whether youâ€™re interested in a discipline. If you canâ€™t think of a personal project that interests you, do you <em>really</em> want it for a career? (And the answer might be yes, for various reasons such as compensation, prestige, etc.)</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/project-drake.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Do a personal project? Nah..." alt="Do a personal project? Nah..."></p>
<p><strong>â€�Other than personal projects, anything else you would recommend?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Nope. My <em>sole</em> recommendation is to start a personal project and learn whatever you need to complete it.</p>
<p>â€¢ â€¢ â€¢</p>
<p>In 2021, instead of taking that MOOC or watching another YouTube machine learning playlist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing" target="_blank">learn by doing</a> instead.</p>
<p>Learning a programming language? Build an app, any app. Share it online and get feedback. Iterate and add new features. Learning a new machine learning technique? Find some novel data and apply it. Understand where it fails, where it shines, and how to adapt it for different data sets. Share your findings via writing online or at a meetup.</p>
<p>Learning comes from doing. Not watching videos, or reading textbooks. Start doing now.</p>

These questions can range from simple customer support queries ("Does user X have the right plan?") to evaluating KPI's and growth metrics ("How many users signed up in the last month and what percent of those converted to paid?") to the more open-ended ("How much revenue will we have in 12 months?").</span></span></p><div id="block-3e9cd828f5334adda85fdbfb4b4cc69a"><div id="block-71f39a4ef039454287b8caa8e53eea89"><p><span><span>To make my job easier, I try to automate as many of these questions as I can. My company, </span><span><a href="https://seekwell.io/blog-gpt3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SeekWell</a></span><span>, builds awesome tools to help with this, like a unified team SQL repository and seamless scheduling of queries, reports, and alerts. Many things, though, like actually writing SQL code, are difficult to automateâ€”or at least have been. </span></span></p></div><div id="block-05f0094e96104a55b608aecb7c35791b"><div id="block-fd67e43c00754a16b725e54946093bb4"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/74a62dc5-b3f1-45ba-a090-36e1f21cd166.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div><h3 id="block-f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"><span id="f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"></span><span><span>Enter GPT-3</span></span></h3><p><span><span><a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Openai</a></span><span>'s </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3</a></span><span> is starting to break the conventional wisdom of what tasks can and can't be automated. At the most basic level, GPT-3 is a text-completion engine, trained on huge swaths of the internet. It takes inputted text and returns the text that it thinks would appear next. Many have already used it to generate HTML and CSS </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a></span><span> from specific design instructions. Others have made </span><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1 trending blog posts</a></span><span> generated mostly by GPT-3 with some creative prompts.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In my case, since so much of my job is writing SQL, I want to be able to describe a question in plain English and have GPT-3 convert it into the SQL code that, if executed on my Postgres database, would answer the question. </span></span></p><p><span><span>To accomplish this, I found more success using </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/the-instruct-series-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3 Instruct</a></span><span> (still in beta) than the more generalized GPT-3 engines. GPT-3 Instruct (in particular,</span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground?model=davinci-instruct-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> davinci-instruct</a></span><span>) lets you give specific instructions, like "Only respond in correct SQL syntax", that guides GPT-3's responses. If you're interested in trying it out, you can sign up for the waitlist for the GPT-3 API </span><span><a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1Lfc7WtPLRk2ppXhPjcYY-A4sk30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span><span>. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Below, I'll detail my experience with the API. In each example, I'll include a gif of asking GPT-3 a question. Below the gif will be the input question (generated by me, in green) and GPT-3's response translating it into SQL (generated by GPT-3, in blue). I'll also include my instructions to GPT-3 (in yellow) and examples I fed GPT-3 (in orange). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Here's the first instruction I gave it, a question, and the response from GPT-3:</span></span></p><div id="block-48ecab24b59a4404bae7f20fb8caf501"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/d99a5fe5-1ca9-43f2-a233-818d878160ac.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how many users signed up in the past month?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response: </strong></span><span>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
WHERE signup_time &gt; now() - interval '1 month'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Woah. I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called "users" (which is accurate) and that there's a timestamp field called "signup_time" for when a user signed up. Pretty logical. It also knew the correct way to subtract a month from today's date in PostgreSQL (now() - interval '1 month') without seeing an example. Pretty cool!</span></span></p><p><span><span>To give GPT-3 a little more context, I'll add information about my database schema to the instruction. My new Instruction: </span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct. Only use tables called "users" and "charges". The "users" table has columns: id (integer), signup_dt (timestamp), email (character varying), and plan_type (character varying). The "charges" table has columns: amount (bigint), user_id (integer), and charge_dt (timestamp).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now I'll try asking another question, and see if GPT-3 can respond based on my actual database:</span></span></p><div id="block-a4da842d10ee45bdaee9837e612a0afb"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/85ecbb57-3212-4ebd-8d13-534d98573a64.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue did we have in the past 7 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; now() - interval '7 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Nice. I gave it a little more information on the tables and columns in my database, and it correctly inferred that "amount" = "revenue" and knew to SUM() that amount for the past 7 days of charges to answer the question. Clearly, it already knows some basic SQL syntax, and can make inferences about what I mean.</span></span></p><h3 id="block-77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"><span id="77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"></span><span><span>Priming GPT-3 with examples</span></span></h3><p><span><span>I'll try another question but first it might make sense to explicitly tell GPT-3 the columns in my tables via a simple example. Examples are a great way to give GPT-3 context and flesh out subtleties that might not be obvious in just an instruction. I found this helpful for really hammering into it which columns and tables are eligible to use (GPT-3 sometimes likes to "invent" columns to make answering the question easier). Here are the examples I added to the prompt:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from users table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT id, signup_dt, email, plan_type FROM users</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from charges table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT amount, user_id, and charge_dt FROM charges</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now with those examples fed to GPT-3, I'll ask another question:</span></span></p><div id="block-58c943723b154475bf698435c315d98d"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/b349a134-f123-4451-bee0-b1ab88b3a3dc.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> what was the largest payment amount made in the past 30 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>It knew to use MAX(amount) to get the largest payment and set the date condition correctly without seeing an example on how to subtract a number of days from the current date. It's doing pretty well, but let's try something a little trickier now, using the same instruction and examples:</span></span></p><div id="block-1af088fb733248dc82c23d45d4f90707"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/bc58b0bf-c5ab-46c6-903c-989e2d5bd0c0.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make his last payment?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(charge_dt) FROM charges WHERE user_id = 1 AND email = 'brian@seekwell.io'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Okay, not </span><span><em>quite </em></span><span>right. The "charges" table doesn't have a column for email, so this query would fail. I also never said the user with email = "brian@seekwell.io" has user_id = 1â€”don't know where it got that idea from. To answer the question correctly, you would have to join the "charges" table with the "users" table since only "users" has an email column. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Since it's a big leap to know to join those tables on </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id (even if that seems perfectly logical to a human analyst), I'll give GPT-3 an example of a "join" so it has something to go off of:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did jane</span><span><a href="mailto:mike@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make her first payment?

New examples:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input: </strong></span><span>how many users signed up in the past 30 days?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE signup_dt &gt;= now() - interval '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>I</span><span><strong>nput:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> sign up?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It’s 2021, and data fetching on the web still sucks. This is crazy!</p>
<p>If you’re building a web app at scale you have plenty of options for data management:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fetch</code>, <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code>, etc. (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/falcor">Falcor</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay">Relay</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js">Protobuf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node">gRPC</a></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>But none of these do everything well. What do you need to do well to be a good data fetching library?</p>
<h2>Fetching Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when fetching data</strong>. When your app fetches new data, the UI should automatically update everywhere that data is used.</li>
<li><strong>Request batching</strong>. When multiple requests are made at the same time, they should be combined into one request, when reasonable, to avoid hitting browser-imposed concurrency limits.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding network waterfalls</strong>. When fetching data for a component, you should make one request that includes data for all its descendents too, to avoid lots of network round trips. GraphQL solves this with fragments, but it’s still painful in modern clients (eg. Relay does this by requiring you  manually compose fragments up the React tree so they’re fetched together, then pass fragment pointers down the tree to tell Relay where to look for fetched data; it also requires a compilation step).</li>
<li><strong>UX when fetching data</strong>. It’s a big burden for engineers to have to manually add loading spinners and error states, and engineers often forget.</li>
<li><strong>Colocation</strong>. You should declare data dependencies close to where they’re used, ideally in the same file. Same principle as colocating CSS with your components.</li>
<li><strong>File size</strong>. You shouldn’t have to ship kilobytes of metadata describing your data schema to clients in order to fetch data.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. Your code should know what type of data it got from the server.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updating your data model should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime updates</strong>. Sometimes, you want data to be pushed, not pulled (eg. for things like notifications). But the APIs for pushing and pulling data are often different, both on the client and on the server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when updating data</strong>. When you update a piece of data, your data fetching library should automatically refetch dependent data that will change after the request completes (eg. if you update <code>Person.FirstName</code>, <code>Person.FullName</code> should automatically be refetched).</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic updates</strong>. The UI should optimistically render the success state before a server response comes back, if there’s a high chance the request will succeed. This makes your UI feel snappy and fun to use. Today’s data fetching libraries make this a lot of manual work.</li>
<li><strong>Request queueing</strong>. Requests that depend on one another need to be queued; independent requests can be sent in parallel. Otherwise, network weather and server queuing can cause your client to end up in a state that’s inconsistent with the server.</li>
<li><strong>UX when updating data</strong>. Product engineers shouldn’t need to manually render loading spinners and success and error notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Durability when updating data</strong>. Exponential backoff for retrying idempotent requests and idempotence tokens for network failures; eager persistance to disk for client/server failures.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. You shouldn’t be able to send invalid input to the server, for some definition of invalid.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updates to your mutation APIs should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I think the reason this hasn’t been solved is it’s a hard problem that’s at the intersection of a bunch of fast-moving technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming languages (to infer what data depends on what)</li>
<li>Databases (client-side stores are small databases)</li>
<li>Server APIs and protocols (REST, GraphQL, RPC, etc.)</li>
<li><s>UI frameworks</s> (at this point, React has won)</li>
<li>User experience and perceived performance</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, every attempt at solving data fetching has either tightly coupled all of these layers, leading to trouble gaining mass adoption (think <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>); other solutions have tackled just one layer, ignoring the rest. This smells to me like the abstractions &amp; APIs for each layer are wrong: you shouldn’t need tight coupling to solve data fetching. Instead, you need better abstractions.</p>
<p>Is this a problem that can be solved?</p>

          <div>
            <p>Over the past year I’ve used web technologies to create audio games like soundStrider and participate in numerous game jams.
With syngen I’m releasing my tools as open-source so folks can join me in crafting dynamic audio experiences and games for the web.
Continue reading to dive into its features, view example code, and learn more about its future.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>syngen is a game engine and synthesis toolkit that specializes in creating audio games with fully synthesized sounds.
If you’ve played any of my games before, then you might be familiar with its capabilities.</p>

<p>It provides a light wrapper around the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Web Audio API</a> with tools for building synths and positioning them as props on a three-dimensional binaural soundstage.
Its event loop fires each frame to update props and core systems.
Additional utilities provide tools for engineering custom systems that hook into its API to deliver rich experiences.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wrapper for the Web Audio API with a domain-specific API</li>
  <li>Event-driven main loop and core systems</li>
  <li>Interfaces and utilities for building custom sounds and systems</li>
  <li>Binaural processing to position sounds on a realistic stage</li>
  <li>Virtualized mixer for advanced signal routing and mastering</li>
  <li>Built-in synthesizers, effects, and global reverb send</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">clone the repository</a> or install with your favorite package manager:</p>



<p>The library <em>must</em> be used within a browser environment so it can access the <code>window</code> object.
You may <code>require('syngen')</code> as a UMD module, or include <code>dist/syngen.min.js</code> to assign it to the <code>syngen</code> global.</p>

<h3 id="example-usage">Example usage</h3>
<p>This example demonstrates how to define a prop and instantiate one on the soundstage.
Here you’ll hear a relatively loud sine tone playing Middle C, centered in the stereo field:</p>

  <span>},</span>
  <span>onDestroy</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>synth</span><span>.</span><span>stop</span><span>()</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>})</span>

<span>const</span> <span>instance</span> <span>=</span> <span>syngen</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>prototype</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

</ul>

<h2 id="the-future-of-syngen">The future of syngen</h2>
<p>This initial release reflects a year of learning with game development.
It contains some assumptions and vestiges that have remained since I first started this journey.
For this reason it’s been released as version 0.1.0 to indicate that it’s experimental and to be used at your own risk in production.
Hopefully the examples above demonstrate the rewards of that gamble.</p>

<p>Because I have games in production on this release branch, it needs to remain backwards compatible.
Therefore, minor version bumps and patch releases will only contain new features and bug fixes.
If it ever reaches the 1.0.0 milestone, then that will indicate a stabilization of this current API.</p>

<p>What I would like to do in a 2.0.0 release branch is reflect on my previous assumptions to rework it entirely.
This might include simplifications and optimizations that improve its power and usability.
Ideally it would empower me to build a new generation of audio games beyond what I’ve thought possible and learned this past year.</p>

<p>Please reach out or <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen/issues" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a> if you encounter any bugs or have any questions or projects to share.
I’m excited to hear your creations!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><div><p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/ethical-dairy-system">ethical dairy model</a> is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.</p></div></div>
<div>
  <div><div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>In traditional dairy farms calves are removed from their mothers within a few hours of their birth - the stress this places on the cow is clear. So we wanted to find a way to keep calves with the cows and still have a financially viable farm. Put simply, we don’t want to have to choose between doing what’s right and staying in business.</p>
<p>As an organic dairy farm for more than twenty years our cows have already benefitted from some of the highest welfare standards in the UK, but we knew we could do even better. We built a new dairy, specially designed to house calves with their mothers, and we trialled the full cow with calf system for the first time in 2012. It taught us a lot, but financially cost us an awful lot.</p>
<p><span>However, the impact it made on cow contentment was staggering. All the animals were noticeably calmer and far more confident. <span>&nbsp;</span>After two to three months the calves became like teenagers, they loved playing with their pals and really only came back to mum when they wanted food!</span></p>
<p><span></span>We are determined to make our radical new model of dairy farming work, and by purchasing cheese from The Ethical Dairy you are helping to support it.</p>
</div></div></div>  </div>

          <h2>The Ethical Journey So Far</h2>

</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>Since October 2016 our calves have stayed with their mothers for 5 to 6 months. We still milk them in that period, but only once a day.</p>
<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotics</a>, increases in <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> and <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/healthier-winter">healthier</a>, happier cows. Compared to an average dairy farm, already The Ethical Dairy has:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/coo-poo-power">energy</a> use by more than half</li>
<li>Cut <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotic</a> use by 90%</li>
<li>Cut agro-chemical use by 90%</li>
<li>Doubled the productive life of cows</li>
<li>Increased our farm <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> five-fold</li>
<li>Increased the net amount of food in our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/politics-food-production">food system</a> by 80%</li>
<li>Exceeded the highest standards of animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethical Dairy has been supported in its journey by many individuals through our crowdfunding campaign in the autumn of 2018, and by public funding, such as Dumfries and Galloway LEADER which is helping us to attend trade shows, events, and to market and promote our products. We are also grateful for support from the Food Processing, Manufacturing and Cooperation grant which has supported the development of our new cheese dairy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our cheese and we thank you for your support of The Ethical Dairy.</p>

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/hermetic_world.jpg" alt="The world description from an hermetic point of view was always convoluted and full of retrospective to enforce meaning" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>The year of the Linux desktop is coming</em>, and it looks like a piñata of
micro-services. Let’s break it and see the candies inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>systemd core — the building block framework abstracting basic functionalities</li>
  <li>A universal package manager with a single reposotiry where anyone can push</li>
  <li>flatpak/appimage/snap — containarized applications</li>
  <li>polkit and apparmor — granular security</li>
  <li>systemd-homed — movable home with an immutable base system</li>
  <li>wayland compositors — the graphical environment</li>
  <li>pipewire — media pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re bored you can leave now, that’s it. Otherwise, let me get more
ideas out, but nothing surprising to anyone that has been following RedHat,
the freedesktop.org, and systemd.</p>

<p>The key innovation of the picture I lay above is that every
layer in the system is now isolated and communicate with one
another through d-bus services. D-bus is <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">fantastic in its own
right</a> and good at
abstracting functionalities.</p>

<p>All of these pieces need one another. Wayland compositors need pipewire
to be able to access media hardware, and pipewire needs polkit (or
similar mechanism) to select who can do that. Similarly, containarized
applications access the rest of the system through systemd services,
polkit, and pipewire.</p>

<p>What this leads to is a base system that is stable, a solid framework
to build on. The home is transportable inside a systemd-homed, along
with the containarized apps, proprietary or not.</p>

<p>The deep secret insider info I got tells me that this is a giant scheme
to get us all in a vendor lock-in. I can lie, this is the internet.<br>
Or better (or worse?), this is a new Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Who’s going to nag when this is all done in the open; when the open
source movers are the implementers of the de-facto implementations;
when they keep piling the standards until nobody can follow them.</p>

<p>I believe the direction the Linux desktop is going towards will
bring more incentives for investments. Distributions uniqueness
won’t matter anymore as they’ll be centralized around a “store”
where devs will push directly. (<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/03/29/distro-pkgs.html">see previous post about distros
roles</a>)</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you weren’t aware of this vision of how distros will
look in the future.</p>

</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best description of the project is on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">the home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is our upgrade path from <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> to a better language and runtime.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a popular cluster manager from Google (released around 2014),
has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>

</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>

POSIX is silent.</li>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="576" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png 536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></figure></div>



<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>What are amulets? How are they situated in the larger narrative of European healing? Varied and complex objects, amulets present both challenges and opportunities for historians and museums alike. Yet an examination of these often-overlooked items within a medical context can provide significant information about cure and protection over different times and geographies. This article analyses ten amulets from the Science Museum collections, and asks what we can learn from exploring these objects’ material features and varying functions. It argues for a re-consideration of amulets from their categorisation by nineteenth- and twentieth-century collectors and classification by modern museums, to their recognition as a significant part of the history of healing.</p>

<h2>Introduction – a hare’s foot and a Billiken</h2>


<p>On his way home from running errands one morning in January 1665, Samuel Pepys stopped to buy a hare. Pepys was a Member of Parliament and administrator of the Navy, and is perhaps most famous for keeping a diary for almost a decade during his younger life. A few weeks earlier, despite ‘very cold weather’ he had celebrated a phase of good health, unsure whether to attribute it to his daily pill of turpentine, the fact that he had ‘left off the wearing of a gowne’, or simply his ‘hare’s foote’. Yet this good health did not last. The new year brought burning, pimples and pricks, bladder problems, headaches and ‘a great deal of pain’ to Pepys’ body (<a href="#reference-60">Pepys; Wheatley (ed), 1893</a>).<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> On this January morning, however, he had run into an acquaintance at Westminster Hall – Sir William Batten, Member of Parliament and surveyor to the Navy (<a href="#reference-59">Pepys, Latham (ed), 2003, p xlv</a>).<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Batten had given Pepys medical advice regarding his latest ailment, a most painful bout of colic, for which he showed Pepys the mistake he had made with the hare’s foot and guaranteed the perfect modification to his remedy. Originally, the foot had not been cut properly, and ‘hath not the joynt to it’; this was where the problem lay.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> Eager to try anything to alleviate his swollen belly and ‘grudgings of wind’, Pepys handled Batten’s correctly cut hare’s foot, and noted in wonder:</p>
<p>[Batten] assures me he never had his cholique since he carried it about him: and it is a strange thing how fancy works, for I no sooner almost handled his foote but my belly began to be loose and to break wind, and whereas I was in some pain yesterday and t’other day and in fear of more to-day, I became very well, and so continue.<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The next day, having obtained a new animal and taken Batten’s advice, Pepys was finally convinced: ‘To my office till past 12, and then home to supper and to bed, being now mighty well, and truly I cannot but impute it to my fresh hare’s foote.’<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> One thing was clear; the hare’s foot had worked. Pepys was cured of colic.</p>

        <p>Amulet One – Hare’s foot, object number A666124</p>
        
    
    
</section>
<p>This object is not unfamiliar to us. This particular hare’s foot, which forms part of the Science Museum’s amulet collection, is originally from Norfolk and dated 1870–1920, but hares’ and rabbits’ feet can still be bought as ‘lucky charms’ and are widely available on the internet.<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Populist literature similarly continues to reference the use of these items; <em>Scientific American</em> published an article on ‘What Makes a Rabbit’s Foot Lucky’ in 2011 (<a href="#reference-19">D’Costa, 2011</a>). Such objects remain a part of popular culture – that is, part of recognised cultural traditions – over three hundred years after being employed by Pepys. Yet we can observe a shift in function. In Pepys’ world, the various elements that constituted sickness and health were broad and wide-ranging. Illness, like health, could be affected by an extensive range of things from an imbalance of the bodily humours, environmental factors such as sleep, food, emotions and exercise, supernatural or preternatural forces, and even the stars.<a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a> Whilst Pepys sometimes consulted learned medical practitioners, the variety of people from whom he could seek counsel was extensive. In this case, he took the advice of his friend Sir William Batten.<a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a> Pepys’ story is part of a larger narrative of healing in which learned medicine, religion, astrology, magic, fate and fortune all played a role. As part of healing, objects could be invested with power from any one or more of these various sources, and employed to cure or protect. These objects have often been called amulets, both historically and today, although our interpretation of them has changed over time. The healing potency of amulets has not always been entirely understood, and their means of operation often hidden from comprehension. Yet within their own contexts, this functional complexity has not detracted from the items’ curative or protective effects. The narrative of healing that included amulets continued throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and only when modern medicine necessitated ‘scientific’, empiric evidence of the mechanisms of objects’ efficacy did this change. In other words, amulets were relegated from the domain of authorised healing once it became a requirement to know and explain <em>how</em> cures worked, not just that they <em>did</em> work.</p>
<div><p>The word ‘amulet’ originates from the Latin ‘amulētum’, and was used by Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) to denote an item worn on the body for therapeutic, apotropaic or exorcistic benefit (Skemer, 2006, pp 6–7). Whilst many have noted the belief that the word can be traced back to Arabic, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has refuted this (<a href="#reference-56">OED, 2018, ‘amulet’</a>). Whilst definitions vary, ‘charm’ is often used synonymously with ‘amulet’, whilst ‘talisman’ features less frequently. For instance, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford has implied a semantic similarity between ‘amulets’ and ‘charms’, noting that an amulet is defined by the OED as: ‘Anything worn about the person as a charm preventative against evil, mischief, disease, witchcraft, etc.’, whilst a charm is described as ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity’ – ‘though a charm may also be a spell or incantation believed to have a magical power’ (<a href="#reference-61">Pitt Rivers Museum, 2017</a>). ‘Amulets’ and ‘charms’ are also used synonymously by the Horniman Museum in London, and the Oxford English Dictionary’s definitions further allude to this; one entry noting that a charm is ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity; an amulet’ (<a href="#reference-39">Horniman Museum, 2017</a>).<a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a></p><p>Evidently, amulets cannot be easily and simply defined, in part because the ways in which they have been used and understood have changed from antiquity to today. What, then, is the defining feature which makes an object an amulet? The answer to this is, its power. In the most basic and fundamental way, amulets are invested with the potency to heal. Healing centres around cure and protection, but where once these two actions were closely related, now they are more distinct. Historically, healing has not been monolithic and has taken many forms, relating to and deriving from faculties of fortune, fate, astrology, religion, magic, luck and more. Healing could therefore constitute anything from curing a specific disease, to averting a malevolent force, or fostering good fortune. This functional variation is valuable, as it can tell us a great deal about the practices and cultures in which objects are situated, as well as the objects themselves. For instance, around 250 years after Pepys cured his colic with our first amulet, the hare’s foot, an amusement park opened in Paris. As part of their brand <em>Luna Park</em> adopted a mascot known as a ‘Billiken’, a creature devised by an American artist who reportedly saw the mysterious figure in a dream and patented it in 1908. The Billiken, known as ‘God of Things as They Ought To Be’ was said to bring the customer luck, indicated by the inscription upon our second object, the park’s token: <em>Si tu me gardes je te porterai bonheur</em> (‘If you keep me I will bring you good luck/happiness’) / ‘I smile at you bad luck can’t harm you’.<a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a> This amulet offered protection and generated auspicious effects to the person who possessed it. Evidently, it had been considered important enough to be kept. Thus whilst culturally, temporally and materially distinct, the hare’s foot and the Luna Park Billiken are nevertheless united by their curative and protective potency, and demonstrate the wide spectrum of healing.</p></div>

</section>
<div><p>Yet where once healing and amulets went hand in hand, modern discussions tend to treat them as distinct. Labelling certain objects as ‘amulets’ questions their power to work, and when these items and their potency are challenged, they are ‘othered’, relegated and disassociated from the realms of healing. The hare’s foot provides an example of this. Whether situated in museum collections or referred to in common parlance, this amulet is not commonly recognised today as a curative object, nor regarded as an effective remedy for the colic. Instead, the feet of rabbits and hares are now bought, used and regarded often merely as ‘lucky’ items. This hare’s foot from the Science Museum’s collections is recorded as an amulet employed ‘for protection against cramp’.<a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a> To label something as prophylactic, an item ‘against’ a particular affliction exemplifies …</p></div></div></section></article></div>
