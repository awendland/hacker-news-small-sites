There will be some innovation and a few compromises, but this combination may pave the way for new and ingenious content.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>As with Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/">previous portable console</a>, the system revolves around a big chip named <strong>CPU NTR</strong>. ‘NTR’ is shorthand for ‘Nitro’, the codename of the original Nintendo DS.</p><p>Now, CPU NTR implements an interesting multi-processor architecture using two different ARM CPUs, this design was done before ARM Holdings officially released multi-processor solutions. So, their functioning may be considered a bit unorthodox taking into account the present technology available.</p><p>While this is not the first parallel system analysed for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/">this series</a>, its design is very different from the rest. For instance, we are not talking about the ‘experimental’ master-slave configuration that the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/">Saturn</a> debuted or the ‘co-processor’ approach found on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/">PS1</a> or <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nintendo-64/">N64</a>. The Nintendo DS includes two very independent computers that will perform exclusive operations, each one having a dedicated bus. This co-dependency will condition the overall performance of this console.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look now at the two CPUs:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-arm7tdmi">ARM7TDMI</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-arm946e-s">ARM946E-S</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi"><h4>ARM7TDMI</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm7_core.8a9851c20df1dda3c252ae75f544a8ce7a6749026fa4bc870027741cda1003b4.png"><picture>

It still includes all its original features (especially <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/#whats-new">Thumb</a>).</p><p>Now for the changes: Because Nintendo’s engineers placed the ARM7 next to most of the I/O ports, this CPU will be tasked with arbitrating and assisting I/O operations. In fact, no other processor can directly connect to the I/O. As you can see, this is not the ‘main’ processor that will be in charge of the system, but rather the ‘sub-processor’ offloading the main CPU by passing data around many components.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s"><h4>ARM946E-S</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm9_core.213329ca27287083c84d30b27fb9da63edd81998406a10b9ee7289089d0fe94d.png"><picture>

If you ignore the ill-fated ARM8 series, you could say the ARM946E-S is the ‘next-gen’ version of the ARM7. Part of the <strong>ARM9 series</strong>, this core in particular not only inherits all the features of the <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> but also includes some additional bits:</p><ul><li>The <strong>ARMv5TE ISA</strong>: Compared to the previous v4, features some new instructions and a faster multiplier.<ul><li>If you take a look at the core name, the letter ‘E’ means <strong>Enhanced DSP</strong> which implies that lots of these new instructions have to do with applications for signal processing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>5-stage Pipeline</strong>: This is another increment from the previous 3-stage pipeline.</li><li><strong>12 KB of L1 Cache</strong>: The core now features cache, where 8 KB are allocated for instructions and 4 KB for data.</li><li><strong>48 KB of Tightly-Coupled Memory</strong> or ‘TCM’: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/#cpu">Scratchpad memory</a>, however this one discriminates between instructions (32 KB) and data (16 KB).</li></ul><p>Nintendo also added the following components around it:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Divisor and Square root unit</strong> to speed up these type of operations (the ARM9 by itself is not capable of performing this type of math).</li><li>A <strong>Direct Memory Access Controller</strong>: Accelerates memory transfers without depending on the CPU. Combined with the use of cache, both CPU and DMA can potentially work concurrently.<ul><li>Cache and DMA can provide a lot of performance but also create new problems, such as data integrity. So programmers will have to manually maintain memory consistency by flushing the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation-2/#preventing-past-mishaps">write-buffer</a> before triggering DMA, for instance.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div><p>I guess with hardware like this, it’s easy to figure out the <em>real</em> reason kids loved this console, eh?</p><h4 id="interconnection">Interconnection</h4><p>So far I’ve talked about how the two CPUs work individually. But to work as a whole, they require to co-operate constantly. To accomplish this, both CPUs directly ‘talk’ to each other using a dedicated <strong>FIFO unit</strong>, this block of data holds two 64-byte queues (up to 16 elements) for <strong>bi-directional communication</strong>.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/fifo.4c452b5f9236fb1e98454d2f90d2cab902ee4c561e165e8eaf8a8fc0cd7a05f4.png"><picture>

Alternatively, an <strong>interrupt unit</strong> can be activated to notify the receiver whenever there’s a new value in the queue.</p><h4 id="main-memory">Main memory</h4><p>Just like its predecessor, RAM is spread around many different locations, enabling to prioritise data placement by speed of access. In summary, we have the following general-purpose memory available:</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/ram.99e9bd12e464182ef51ea4aa89a7fc60323a46a72550afbacd737957372cf190.png"><picture>

Therefore, behaving like SRAM (the faster, but more expensive alternative to DRAM). This design reminds me of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#clever-memory-system">1T‑SRAM</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><h4 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h4><p>Even though the architecture is significantly different from its predecessor, it still managed to maintain the critical bits that would grant it native compatibility with GameBoy Advance games.</p><p>But for the DS to revert to an ‘internal’ GBA, the former includes a set of software routines that set the console in <strong>AGB Compatibility Mode</strong>. In doing so, it effectively halts the ARM9, disables most of the ‘special’ hardware, redirects the buses, puts the ARM7 in charge and slows it down at 16.78 MHz. Finally, the ARM7 proceeds to boot the original AGB BIOS which bootstraps the GamePak cartridge (just like an original GameBoy Advance). This mode still exhibits some features not found in the original console, such as displaying the game with black margins (we’ll see in the next section that the new screen resolution happens to be bigger). Moreover, since the DS has two screens, users can set which screen will be used to display the GBA game.</p><p>Once in GBA mode <strong>there’s no going back</strong>, the console must be reset to re-activate the rest of the hardware.</p><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and limitations</h4><p>With so many sophisticated components fitted in a single and inexpensive chip, it’s no mystery that some issues emerged due to the way they were forced to work with each other.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-unused-power-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-unused-power">Unused Power</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice">A question about the hardware choice</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-unused-power"><h4>Unused Power</h4><p>Sometimes I wonder how Nintendo planned the way the two CPU’s would be used, and if they already assumed some performance would be hit by the design they chose.</p><p>Let me start with the ARM9, this CPU runs at twice the speed of the ARM7, but most (if not all) of the I/O depends on the ARM7, so the ARM9 is vulnerable to excessive stalling until the ARM7 answers. If that wasn’t enough, <strong>ARM9’s external bus runs at half the speed</strong>, so there are a few bottlenecks identified.</p><p>Additionally, the Main Memory bus is only <strong>16-bit wide</strong>. Thus, whenever any CPU needs to fetch a word (32-bit wide) from memory, the interface <strong>stalls the CPU</strong> (up to 3 ‘wait’ cycles) until a full world is reconstructed. The worst impact happens when memory access is not sequential, which makes it stall for every single access. This issue will also arise when instructions are fetched (unfortunately, ARM didn’t support sequential opcode fetching back then) which, to my dismay, also affects Thumb code (since every 16-bit fetch is done as a 32-bit block). On the other hand, this penalty (as some sources call it) can be alleviated by making full use of cache and TCM.</p><p>All in all, this means that in the worst case, the ‘whooping’ ARM9’s 66 MHz horsepower is practically reduced to a mere ~8&nbsp;MHz. That is if the program makes an abysmal use of cache/TCM.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice"><h4>A question about the hardware choice</h4><p>Back when I read about the CPU of the GameBoy Advance, I was really surprised by the potential of the ARM7: The CPU not only performed its designated tasks, but could also assist with others, such as providing audio sequencing or pseudo-3D graphics.</p><p>Now, during the commercialisation ARM7, ARM Holdings joined forces with DEC to design a high-end version of ARM’s chips. For this, DEC grabbed the datapath design of their processor, <strong>Alpha</strong>, and mixed it with ARM’s. The result was a new series of CPUs called <strong>StrongARM</strong> which was surprisingly <em>fast</em>. At the expense of removing certain features (Thumb and debug), DEC managed to cross the megahertz threshold by reaching speeds of up to 233 MHz. As a normal user prepared to buy a new ARM PC (let’s say a <em>RiscPC</em>), you could either choose one with the old ARM710 at 40 MHz or another one with a StrongARM running ~582% faster. The impact of StrongARM was so disruptive that ARM Holdings absorbed some of StrongARMs features to produce their next line of CPUs, starting with ARM9. And the rest is history.</p><p>But here’s where my question resides: Considering the new developments in the ARM world, why did Nintendo ultimately choose an awfully slow ARM9 combined by an even slower ARM7, instead of a faster ARM9 (or even a StrongARM)? To give you an idea, other companies like Apple just adopted the StrongARM with their Newton PDA line.</p><p>I don’t mean to criticise Nintendo’s choice, but I believe the amount of emerging technology was just too great for me to ignore. I guess their choice was done in an effort to preserve battery life and maintain production costs (by using the same CPU found in the GBA).</p></div></div></div><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>This section is a bit unusual because not only this console has multiple screens to draw, but also a combination of traditional tile engines working …</p></div></div></div>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/header.png">
</p>

<p>
The way I was taught x86 assembly at the university had been completely outdated for many years by the time I had my first class. It was around 2008 or 2009, and 64-bit processors had already started becoming a thing even in my neck of the woods. Meanwhile, we were doing DOS, real-mode, memory segmentation and all the other stuff from the bad old days.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I picked up enough of it during the classes (and over the subsequent years) to be able to understand the stuff coming out of the other end of a compiler, and that has helped me a few times. However, I've never manually written any substantial amount of x86 assembly for something non-trivial. Due to being locked up inside (on account of a global pandemic), I decided to change that situation, to pass the time.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to focus on x86-64 specifically, and completely forget/skip any and all legacy crap that is no longer relevant for this architecture. After getting a bit deeper into it, I also decided to publish my notes in the form of tutorials on this blog since there seems to be a desire for this type of content.
</p>

<p>
Everything I write in these posts will be a normal, 64-bit, Windows program. We'll be using Windows because that is the OS I'm running on all of my non-work machines, and when you drop down to the level of writing assembly it starts becoming incresingly impossible to ignore the operating system you're running on. I will also try to go as "from scratch" as possible - no libraries, we're only allowed to call out to the operating system and that's it.
</p>

<p>
In this first, introductory part (yeah, I'm planning a series and I know I will regret this later), I will talk about the tools we will need, show how to use them, explain how I generally think about programming in assembly and show how to write what is perhaps the smallest viable Windows program.
</p>

<h2>Getting the Tools</h2>
<p>There are two main tools that we will use throughout this series.</p>

<h3>Assembler</h3>

<p>
CPUs execute machine code - an efficient representation of instructions for the processor that is almost completely impenetrable to humans. The assembly language is a human-readable representation of it. A program that converts this symbolic representation into machine code ready to be executed by a CPU is called an <b>assembler</b>.
</p>

<p>
There is no single, agreed-upon standard for x86-64 assembly language. There are many assemblers out there, and even though some of them share a great deal of similarities, each has its own set of features and quirks. It is therefore important which assembler you choose. In this series, we will be using 
<a href="http://flatassembler.net/">Flat Assembler</a> (or FASM for short). I like it because it's small, easy to obtain and use, has a nice macro system and comes with a handy little editor.</p>

<h3>Debugger</h3>

<p>
Another important tool is the debugger. We'll use it to examine the state of our programs. While I'm pretty sure it's possible to use Visual Studio's integrated debugger for this, I think a standalone debugger is better when all you want to do is look at the disassembly, memory and registers. I've always used <a href="http://ollydbg.de/">OllyDbg</a> for stuff like that, but unfortunately it does not have a 64-bit version. Therefore we will be using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windbg-preview/9pgjgd53tn86?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">WinDbg</a>. The version linked here is a revamp of this venerable tool with a slightly nicer interface. Alternatively, you can get the non-Windows-store version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">here</a> as part of the Windows 10 SDK. Just make sure you deselect everything else besides WinDbg during installation. For our purposes, the two versions are mostly interchangeable.
</p>

<h2>Thinking in Assembly</h2>

<p>
Now that we have our tools, I want to spend a bit of time to discuss some basics. For the purpose of these tutorials I'm assuming some knowledge of languages like C or C++, but little or no previous exposure to assembly, therefore many readers will find this stuff familiar.
</p>
<h3>A 10000-foot view</h3>
<p>
CPUs only "know" how to do a fixed number of certain things. When you hear someone talk about an "instruction set", they're referring to the set of things a particular CPU has been designed to do, and the term "instruction" just means "one of the things a CPU can do". Most instructions are parameterized in one way or another, and they're generally really simple. Usually an instruction is somthing along the lines of "write a given 8-bit value to a given location in memory", or "interpreting the values from registers A and B as 16-bit signed integers, multiply them and record the result into register A".
</p>

<p>
Below is a simple mental model of the architecture that we'll start with.
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/diag0.png">
</p>

<p>
 This skips a <i>ton</i> of things (there can be more than one core executing instructions and reading/writing memory, there's different levels of cache, etc. etc.), but should serve as a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
 To be effective at low-level programming or debugging you need to understand that every high-level concept eventually maps to this low-level model, and learning how the mapping works will help you.
</p>

<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>
 You can think of <b>registers</b> as a special kind of memory built right into the CPU that is very small, but extremely fast to access. There are many different kinds of registers in x86-64, and for now we'll concern ourselves only with the so-called <i>general-purpose</i> registers, of which there are sixteen. Each of them is 64 bits wide, and for each of them the lower byte, word and double-word can be addressed individually (incidentally, 1 "word" = 2 bytes, 1 "double-word" = 4 bytes, in case you haven't heard this terminology before).
 </p>
 
 <table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td><b>Register</b></td>
  <td><b>Lower byte</b></td>
  <td><b>Lower word</b></td>
  <td><b>Lower dword</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rax</td> <td>al</td> <td>ax</td> <td>eax</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rbx</td> <td>bl</td> <td>bx</td> <td>ebx</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rcx</td> <td>cl</td> <td>cx</td> <td>ecx</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rdx</td> <td>dl</td> <td>dx</td> <td>edx</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rsp</td> <td>spl</td> <td>sp</td> <td>esp</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rsi</td> <td>sil</td> <td>si</td> <td>esi</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rdi</td> <td>dil</td> <td>di</td> <td>edi</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rbp</td> <td>bpl</td> <td>bp</td> <td>ebp</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r8</td> <td>r8b</td> <td>r8w</td> <td>r8d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r9</td> <td>r9b</td> <td>r9w</td> <td>r9d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r10</td> <td>r10b</td> <td>r10w</td> <td>r10d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r11</td> <td>r11b</td> <td>r11w</td> <td>r11d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r12</td> <td>r12b</td> <td>r12w</td> <td>r12d</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td>r13</td> <td>r13b</td> <td>r13w</td> <td>r13d</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td>r14</td> <td>r14b</td> <td>r14w</td> <td>r14d</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td>r15</td> <td>r15b</td> <td>r15w</td> <td>r15d</td>
 </tr>   
</tbody></table>  

<p>Additionally, the higher 8 bits of <code>rax</code>, <code>rbx</code>, <code>rcx</code> and <code>rdx</code> can be referred to as <code>ah</code>, <code>bh</code>, <code>ch</code> and <code>dh</code>.</p>

<p>
Note that even though I said those were "general-purpose" registers, some instructions can only be used with certain registers, and some registers have special meaning for certain instructions. In particular, <code>rsp</code> holds the stack pointer (which is used by instructions like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>call</code> and <code>ret</code>), and <code>rsi</code> and <code>rdi</code> serve as source and destination index for "string manipulation" instructions. Another example where certain registers get "special treatment" are the multiplication instructions, which require one of the multiplier values to be in the register <code>rax</code>, and write the result into the pair of registers <code>rax</code> and <code>rdx</code>.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these registers, we will also consider the special registers <code>rip</code> and <code>rflags</code>. <code>rip</code> holds the address of the next instruction to execute. It is modified by control flow instructions like <code>call</code> or <code>jmp</code>. <code>rflags</code> holds a bunch of binary flags indicating various aspects of the program's state, such as whether the result of the last arithmetic operation was less, equal or greater than zero. The behavior of many instructions depends on those flags, and many instructions update certain flags as part of their execution. The flags register can also be read and written "wholesale" using special instructions.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot more registers on x86-64. Most of them are used for SIMD or floating-point instructions, and we'll not be considering them in this series.
</p>

<h3>Memory and Addresses</h3>

<p>
You can think of memory as a large array of byte-sized "cells", numbered starting at 0. We'll call these numbers "memory addresses". Simple, right?
</p>
<p>
Well... addressing memory used to be rather annoying back in the old days. You see, registers in old x86 processors used to be only 16-bit wide. Sixteen bits is enough to address 64 kilobytes worth of memory, but not more. The hardware was actually capable of using addresses as wide as 20 bits, but you had put a "base" address into a special segment register, and instructions that read or wrote memory would use a 16-bit offset into that segment to obtain the final 20-bit "linear" address. There were separate segment registers for code, data and stack portions (and a few more "extra" ones), and segments could overlap. 
</p>
<p>
In x86-64 these concerns are non-existant. The segment registers for code, data and stack are still present, and they're loaded with some special values, but as a user-space programmer you needn't concern yourself with them. For all intents and purposes you can assume that all segments start at 0 and extend for the entire addressable length of memory. So, as far as we're concerned, on x86-64 our programs see memory as a "flat" contiguous array of bytes, with sequential addresses, starting at 0, just like we said in the beginning of this section...
</p>
<p>
Okay, I may have distorted the truth a little bit. Things aren't quite as simple. While it is true that on 64-bit Windows your programs see memory as a flat contiguous array of bytes with addresses starting at 0, it is actually an elaborate illusion maintained by the OS and CPU working together.
</p>
<p>
The truth is, if you were really able to read and write any byte in memory willy-nilly, you'd stomp all over other programs' code and data (something that indeed could happen in the Bad Old Days). To prevent that, special protection mechanisms exist. I won't get too deep into their inner workings here because this stuff matters mostly for OS developers. Nevertheless, here's a very short overview:
</p>
<p>
Each process gets a "flat" address space as described above (we'll call it the "virtual address space"). For each process, the OS sets up a <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging">mapping</a> between its virtual addresses and actual physical addresses in memory. This mapping is respected by the hardware: the "virtual" addresses get translated to physical addresses dynamically at runtime. Thus, the same address (e.g. 0x410F119C) can map to two different locations in physical memory for two different processes. This, in a nutshell, is how the separation between processes in enforced.
</p>

<p>
The final thing I want to invite your attention to here is how the instructions and data which they operate on are held in the same …</p></main></div></div>

<p>It seems impossible, however, thanks to a particular initiative that is becoming more and more popular, this can become a reality. The project <strong>Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> has sprung from a few Italian municipalities with the intent to counter the population outflow and to give a new birth to troubled areas.<br>
With this operation <strong>Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> we try to repopulate gorgeous villages that are being deserted, with the young population leaving and the elderly slowly fading away.</p>
<p>This unprecedented proposal has struggled initially, but it’s gaining popularity in recent times. This long-term strategy is attractive for those who are looking for low-cost real estate investments in Italy, and to simply restore prestige to Italian villages famous all over the world for their extraordinary beauty, and for that vintage spirit so cherished nowadays.</p>
<p>[metaslider id=”207″]
</p><p>Additionally, the <strong>Project Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> could positively shock to the Italian real estate market facilitating access to homes by young people, for whom it is becoming increasingly difficult to take out a mortgage.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the repopulation of these small villages also promotes tourist activities, regenerating the economy of the entire area. To enhance the tourism economy, it is possible to repurpose an old building as a boutique hotel, a B&amp;B, or even to create a bigger project involving multiple premises in the same village to create a scattered hotel.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are many very interesting possibilities and implications.</p>

<p><span>Despite the buzz around GPT-3, it is, in and of itself, not AGI.</span> In many ways, this makes it similar to AlphaGo or Deep Blue; while approaching human ability in one domain (playing Chess/Go, or writing <em>really</em> impressively), it doesn’t really seem like it will do <span><a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Intelligence_explosion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scary AGI Things™</a></span> any more than AlphaGo is going to be turning the Earth into paperclips anytime soon. While its writings are impressive at emulating humans, GPT-3 (or any potential future GPT-x) has no memory of past interactions, nor is it able to follow goals or maximize utility. However, language modelling has one <em>crucial</em> difference from Chess or Go or image classification. Natural language essentially encodes information about the world—the <em>entire</em> world, not just the world of the Goban, in a much more expressive way than any other modality ever could.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> By harnessing the world model embedded in the language model, it may be possible to build a proto-AGI.</p>

<p>The explicit goal of a language model is only to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximize likelihood</a> of the model on natural language data. In the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2019/10/27/The-Difficulties-of-Text-Generation-with-Autoregressive-Language-Models/">autoregressive formulation</a> that GPT-3 uses, this means being able to predict the next word as well as possible. However, this objective places much more weight on large, text-scale differences like grammar and spelling than fine, subtle differences in semantic meaning and logical coherency, which reflect as very subtle shifts in distribution. Once the former are near-perfect, though, the only place left to keep improving is the latter.</p>
<p>At the extreme, any model whose loss reaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shannon entropy</a> of <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1999-00/information-theory/entropy_of_english_9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural language</a>—the theoretical lowest loss a language model can possibly achieve, due to the inherent randomness of language—will be <em>completely indistinguishable</em> from writings by a real human in every way, and the closer we get to it, the more abstract the effect on quality of each bit of improvement in loss. Or, said differently, stringing words together using <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markov chain generators</a> gets you 50% of the way there, figuring out grammar gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, staying on topic across paragraphs gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, being logically consistent gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, and so on.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Why? Because if you have a coherent-but-not-logically consistent model, becoming more logically consistent helps you predict language better. Having a model of human behavior helps you predict language better. Having a model of the world helps you predict language better. As the low-hanging fruits of grammar and basic logical coherence are taken, the only place left for the model to keep improving the loss is a world model. Predicting text is <a href="http://mattmahoney.net/dc/rationale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equivalent to AI</a>.</p>
<p>The thing about GPT-3 that <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">makes it so important</a> is that it provides evidence that as long as we keep increasing the model size, we can keep driving down the loss, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly right up until</a> it hits the Shannon entropy of text. No need for clever architectures or complex handcrafted heuristics. Just by scaling it up we can get a better language model, and a better language model entails a better world model.</p>
<p>But how do we use this language model if it’s buried implicitly-represented inside GPT-x, though? Well, we can literally just <em>ask</em> it, in natural language, what it thinks will happen next given a sequence of events, and its output distribution will approximate the distribution of what the average human thinks would happen next after those events. Great—we’ve got ourselves a usable world model.</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say, “<a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/621186154843324416/all-your-questions-answered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Various</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1284042570507542528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiments</a> have shown that GPT-3 often fails at world modelling, and just conjecturing that adding more parameters will fix the problem is a <em>massive</em> leap!” If you’re thinking this, you’re absolutely correct. The biggest and most likely to be wrong assumption that I’m making is that larger models will develop better world models. Since as loss approaches the Shannon entropy its world modelling ability has to become about as good than the average human on the internet<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, this boils down to two questions: “Will we really make models whose loss gets close enough to the Shannon entropy?” and “How close is close enough, in order to have the world modelling capabilities to make all this practical?”</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf_scaling_compute.png" alt="Loss keeps going down with more parameters and compute. (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The answer to the first question is “most likely”—that’s the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">main takeaway of GPT-3</a>. The answer to the second question is… nobody knows. Some have demonstrated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23990902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways of making GPT-3 better at world modelling</a>, but this alone is probably not sufficient. When models with 1 trillion, then 10 trillion, then 100 trillion parameters become available, we will have empirical evidence to see whether this assumption is correct. If GPT-x demonstrates uncanny ability to predict outcomes in the real world, then this just might work.</p>

<p>A world model alone does not an agent make, though.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> So what does it take to make a world model into an agent? Well, first off we need a goal, such as <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“maximize number of paperclips”</a>. Then, we just ask the world model “What action can I take to maximize the number of paperclips I have?” Simple, right? Actually, not quite. The problem is that our world model probably won’t be able to consider all the possible things that could happen next well enough to make a reasonable answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mesa.png" alt="GPT-3 considers mesa-optimization. (Source: OpenAI API)"></p>
<p>So what can we do instead? Well, asking the world model for a list of things you could do in a given world state would probably not be outside the capabilities of a sufficiently powerful language model (think: “I am in situation <span>xyz</span>. Here is a list of things I could do:”). Similarly, asking the world model how much reward you’d get in some hypothetical world where you took a sequence of actions would probably be possible too—imagine asking something along the lines of “I go to ebay. I look up paperclips, sorted by price ascending. I spend $100 on the first item on the list. How many paperclips will I have?”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> This will let us figure out what actions the agent can take in any given step (policy function), as well as how much reward each sequence of steps will net the agent (value function).</p>
<p>So now, to estimate the state-action value of any action, we can simply do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a> to estimate the state-action values! Starting from a given agent state, we can roll out sequences of actions using the world model. By integrating over all rollouts, we can know how much future expected reward the agent can expect to get for each action it considers. Then, we can simply use, for example, a greedy policy with that state-action value function, to decide on actions to take.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mcts.png" alt="Monte Carlo Tree Search visualized (<a href='https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Phases-of-the-Monte-Carlo-tree-search-algorithm-A-search-tree-rooted-at-the-current_fig1_312172859'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>Each of these actions is likely to be very high level, such as “figure out the cheapest way to buy paperclips”, but thanks to the flexibility of language we can describe very complex ideas with short sequences of tokens. To actually execute these abstract actions once the agent decides on an action, that action can be broken down using the language model into smaller sub-goals such as “figure out the cheapest paperclips on Amazon”, similar to <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6233-hierarchical-deep-reinforcement-learning-integrating-temporal-abstraction-and-intrinsic-motivation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</a>. Possibly even just breaking actions down into a detailed list of instructions would be feasible, depending on the capabilities of the model and how abstract the actions are.</p>
<p>We can represent the agent state as natural language, too. Since the agent state is just a compressed representation of the observations, we can ask the language model to summarize the important information of any observations for its own internal world state. The language model could be used to periodically prune (i.e forget) the information inside its state, too, to make room for more observations.</p>
<p>Altogether, this gets us a system where we can pass observations from the outside world in, spend some time thinking about what to do, and output an action in natural language.</p>
<p>To handle input, you could have an input module that turns various modalities of observations into summarized text with respect to the current agent state. For instance, you could use something like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iGPT</a> to input camera images or screenshots, or raw HTML from webpages that the agent requests. How exactly this is done is tangential to the point; all that matters is that somehow the inputs are all converted to text and added to the agent state. The examples I have provided are just to convince you that it’s absolutely not insurmountable.</p>
<p>Finally, to get the model to actually act in the world, you could again use the language model to translate natural language into <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Microsoft/1OyKAYWPRrWKb?t=29m19s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code that is then executed</a>, or <a href="https://vimeo.com/427943407/98fe5258a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shell commands</a>, or sequences of keypresses, or any of a number of other possible ways. Like input, there are an infinitude of different ways to solve the output problem, and which one turns out to be the best is entirely irrelevant to our discussion; all that matters is that it’s possible to get various modalities in and out of the text-only agent.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/paperclipsamzn.png" alt="An example of an input module taking a screenshot input combined with the current agent state to give an observation with the information needed by the agent."></p>

<p>This is more a thought experiment than something that’s actually going to happen tomorrow; GPT-3 today just isn’t good enough at world modelling. Also, this method depends heavily on at least one major assumption—that bigger future models will have much better world modelling capabilities—and a bunch of other smaller implicit assumptions. <strong><span>However</span></strong>, this might be the closest thing we ever get to a chance to <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound the fire alarm</a> for AGI: there’s now a concrete path to proto-AGI that has a non-negligible chance of working.</p>

<!--[^toolai]: One common line of argument is that such "tool AIs" are good enough and have desirable safety properties, and therefore agentistic AI need not ever be developed. One argument against this idea is that [agent AI will inevitably be more economically valuable than tool AI](https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI), which would encourage their development.-->

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a simple [Markov chain generator](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild) makes a *massive* difference, but the loss difference between a Markov chain generator and GPT-2 is much smaller despite GPT-2 being able to manage grammatically correct sentences nearly all of the time, and the loss difference between GPT-2 and GPT-3 is smaller still, despite massive subjective improvements in quality. 

The difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "shxixpgozcvoomz jcxfgabsdcxfrevogjsqewdnmkj" is *massive*, but the difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a model that uses words in the same [Zipf distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) as regular text earns a large decrease in loss, because if you always pick common words like "the" you have a much better chance of being right than picking rare words. Another big decrease comes from considering n-gram frequencies rather than just single-word frequencies; this is the driving idea behind [Markov chain generators](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild), which generate surprisingly good text considering how just how simple they are.

                <p><em>This is the first in what will, hopefully, become a series. I would like to highlight projects that are widely used, even to the point of being part of critical infrastructure, but are nevertheless small projects with small (often unsponsored) development teams. We start the series talking to Simon&nbsp;Kelley.</em></p>
<p>dnsmasq is one of the unsung heroes of the Internet: a small piece of software used very widely, but with a <em>very</em> small development team, and no corporate backing. It is used as the <span>DHCP</span> and caching <span>DNS</span> server on a wide variety of home-market routers, as well as other devices, and is the default <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> caching server for libvirt, and by extension, OpenStack. A couple years ago, I contacted Simon Kelley, the author of dnsmasq, and asked if he was up for an interview. He was, but my blog wasn’t in a maintainable position at that point, so it got pushed back. I contacted him again recently, and we managed to make it happen. This interview was conducted via e-mail on December 10,&nbsp;2017.</p>

<p>Simon, thank you for taking time out of your schedule (when you could be
programming) to answer my questions. This is quite an honor, and I hope you
enjoy the&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>What itch were you scratching, that is, what was your original need and
intention for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Long ago, around the turn of the century, I had a <span>PC</span>, running Linux, and
a net connection via a dial-up modem. If the <span>PC</span> was not connected to the
net then Netscape navigator would return an error immediately, because
the <span>UDP</span> packet doing a <span>DNS</span> query got a “no route to host” error. Then I
got a second-hand 486 laptop, and discovered that I could connect
that to my <span>PC</span> and give it a net connection too, using this amazing thing
called ip-masquerading (what later became <span>NAT</span>.) But when the Netscape on the
laptop would send the <span>UDP</span> <span>DNS</span> query to the <span>ISP</span>, it would get to the
desktop, where it would evaporate, and Netscape would hang (it was
single-threaded, at least in the <span>DNS</span> code) for a long time-out. I wanted
to fix that annoying behaviour. The <span>IP</span>-masquerade use is where the
DNSmasq name came&nbsp;from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you intend to release it as open source from the&nbsp;beginning?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that I intended to release it,&nbsp;yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much did you know about <span>DNS</span> and <span>DHCP</span> when you&nbsp;started?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost nothing, about the internals anyway. I started with <span>RFC</span> 1035 and
went from&nbsp;there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the most interesting bug you’ve run&nbsp;into?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not one of mine - I found a Linux kernel bug once, in the <span>API</span> to control
the <span>ARP</span> cache. The bug was long-ago fixed, but in a sense, the
work-around still persists in dnsmasq. It was difficult to find because
it was intermittent and hard to reproduce, and it took a long time to
consider that the problem may not have been mine, but in the&nbsp;Kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Related: when fixing a bug (found by you or reported), what has been your
most “What was I thinking when I wrote that”&nbsp;moment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plenty of those. I once found a “&amp;” versus “&amp;&amp;” confusion which nobody
had spotted as a functional error, by code&nbsp;inspection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever found bugs in other <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> products/libraries as a
result of your testing? What was the most interesting one? Feel free to share
others, if you&nbsp;wish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are lots of <span>DHCP</span> clients in things like printers and scanners and
general IoT devices which behave badly and need workarounds. Intel
produced some awful bugs in <span>PXE</span> implementations which went into netboot
<span>ROMS</span> and never got&nbsp;updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was your most “you’ve got to be kidding me” moment when learning new
corners of <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> and/or your biggest “I wish I had known that when I
started”&nbsp;moment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s always amused me that the format of a <span>DNS</span> packet - which is very
size constrained to fit into <span>UDP</span> packets, wastes 16 bits for a count of
the number of questions in a query. This has been constrained to be
exactly one for all of the life of <span>DNS</span>, so the 16 bits are completely
wasted. <span>DNS</span> in general is an amazingly under-specified and obscure area.
It’s been around forever, and is developed by people who have been
around for a long time and grown up with it. They tend to vastly
underestimate how much implied knowledge they are assuming when writing
RFCs. As for what I wished I’d known: I wished I’d found the <span>RFC</span> which
is an errata  to the original three <span>DNSSEC</span> RFCs earlier; I found several
of the bugs the hard&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was your reaction when you found out dnsmasq was used as the default
forwarder/<span>DHCP</span> server for OpenStack? What is it like having your project used
in one the most well known open source projects in the&nbsp;world?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That happened after dnsmasq was incorporated into Android, so it was
sort of an anti-climax after getting into the majority of smart phones on
the&nbsp;planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ed. note: point&nbsp;taken]</p>
<p>Besides OpenStack, what are some of the most interesting use cases you’ve
heard about for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took some patches from someone who was providing satellite Internet to
trans-oceanic sailors. Bandwidth costs were high enough that it made
sense to audit almost every byte sent and received, including for <span>DNS</span>&nbsp;resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever gotten contributions (code or otherwise) back from router
manufacturers that have used&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably, but I don’t remember anything significant in terms of code.
Comcast paid for a year of my time to implement <span>DNSSEC</span>, which was pretty
good of&nbsp;them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What kind of contributions have you turned&nbsp;down?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s people who make a patch to solve their particular problem and
don’t give any thought to making it general, or generally&nbsp;useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you talk about one significant or difficult contribution you turned down
and why? - From my co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/eduncan911">Eric Duncan&nbsp;@eduncan911</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one that’s happened over and over again is to change the behaviour
on receiving a “no-such-domain” reply from an upstream nameserver.
People want to implement local <span>DNS</span> hacks by getting dnsmasq to keep
trying another upstream server when the first returns <span>NXDOMAIN</span>, but
that’s always seemed to me to be a really bad thing to do: <span>NXDOMAIN</span> is a
valid answer, and not a failure&nbsp;return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have a group of steady contributors, or is it pretty much just you
(and occasional&nbsp;contributions)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are steady contributors, but long-term, it’s just&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are pretty active on the mailing list. For the second quarter of 2017,
nearly 80 messages of the 229 are from you. How much time do you spend on the
project (code and helping&nbsp;users)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very variable, and less than I used to. I used to have a job with a very
<span>FOSS</span>-friendly employer. I was sitting in front of computer most days,
and my boss was happy for me to spend time on dnsmasq. Nowadays, I’m
semi-retired, and I spend my days doing other stuff, so I have to make
time to sit down and work on&nbsp;dnsmasq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your motivation for self-hosting, vs. moving to something like
Github or&nbsp;Bitbucket?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The self-hosting setup existed before Github etc, or at least before
they were visible and known to be reliable. It works, so I’ve never had
the activation energy to move it. I’m a sysadmin and I like having a
host to do my stuff, my&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your <span>FAQ</span> says it will run on Linux, *<span>BSD</span>, and embedded systems. What is the
most interesting platform you’ve heard of using&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somebody ran it on <span>QNX</span> once, I&nbsp;believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commit 1 in the dnsmasq git repository happened on January 22, 2004, and
says it is an “import of dnsmasq-2.0.tar.gz.”  When was your first public
release (version 0.4)? How long had you been working on it before&nbsp;then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 2000. There were quite a few releases in the 1.x series, which
were before the <span>DHCP</span> server was added. It didn’t seem worth adding those
when I moved into&nbsp;git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your future plans, dreams, and hopes for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like all code that’s 15 years old, there are deep design decisions and
trade-off that are hard to change but which don’t necessarily make sense
any more. I’d like to do a version 3.0 which addresses those, but I’m
not sure I have the commitment left in me to do&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html">recent security fixes contributed by Google</a> did
you know they were working on dnsmasq, or did the fixes come as a&nbsp;suprise?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They didn’t tell me they were working on dnsmasq before they started,
but once they’d found holes, they let me know well before the public
disclosure. There’s a whole raft of stuff which happens in case like
this, and the Google security people were really good at helping to work
through it.  A lot is helping distributions to get patched packages ready in
advance: I spend a lot of effort helping people backport the fixes to
the older&nbsp;versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have any steps been taken to do a full audit, or is that what Google&nbsp;did?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been quite a few audits over the years, before Google did its
stuff. <span>SUSE</span> did one, and the Mozilla foundation sponsored one. The
Google people used fuzzing to find the holes that had been missed by the
audits - it’s very&nbsp;impressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has the  recent security news changed the development process&nbsp;any?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I plan to use Google’s service to do ongoing fuzzing of new&nbsp;releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything significant on the dnsmasq road map? Are there additions that could
be done, or do you cover all of the <span>DNS</span>/<span>DHCP</span> spec&nbsp;now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t cover the whole spec - the <span>USP</span> [ed. note: Unique Selling Point] is to cover the bits that my
users need, without carrying the bloat of everything else. I guess that
new stuff is still likely in the area of IPv6 address/name management.
IPv6 will take over the world one day, won’t&nbsp;it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ed. note: We&nbsp;hope.]</p>
<p>Do you have a Patreon, Flattr, or other funding source to which people could&nbsp;contribute?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a PayPal account at simon@thekelleys.org.uk. Contributions
happily&nbsp;accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks again! I hope our paths will cross some&nbsp;day!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope that’s useful. Please feel free to come back with more questions,
or for clarifications on the&nbsp;answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That wraps it up! I greatly appreciate Simon taking time to do this. If you have questions, ask them in the&nbsp;comments.</p>

    <p>Lately, I’ve been playing around with inventing a visual writing system for lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a> (λ-calculus) is a sort of proto-functional-programming, originally invented by Alonzo Church while he was trying to solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem">the same problem</a> that led Turing to invent Turing machines. It’s another way of reasoning about computation.</p>

<p>Python’s lambda is an idea that was borrowed from λ-calculus. In Python, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions">lambda expression</a> like the following in order to define a function that returns the square of a number:</p>



<p>In λ-calculus, the idea is the same: we create a function by using <code>λ</code> to specify which arguments a function takes in, then we give an expression for the function’s return value. Pure lambda calculus doesn’t include operators of any sort –&nbsp;just functions being applied to other functions –&nbsp;so if we try to write a <code>square</code> function, we have to suppose that <code>multiply</code> is a function of two variables that has already been defined:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square = λx. multiply x x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>square</code> function, once defined, can be applied to arguments and evaluated into something simpler.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square 4 = (λx. multiply x x) 4
         = multiply 4 4
         = 16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the cool things about lambda calculus is that we can represent most common programming abstractions using λ-calculus, even though it’s nothing but functions: numbers, arithmetic, booleans, lists, if statements, loops, recursion… the list goes on. Before I introduce the visual writing system I’ve been using, let’s take a detour and discuss how we can represent numbers and arithmetic using lambda calculus.</p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-calculus">Church numerals, in lambda calculus</h2>
<p>Alonzo Church figured out how to represent numbers as lambda functions; these numbers are referred to as Church numerals.</p>

<p>We can represent any nonnegative integer as long as we have two things: (1) a value for <strong>zero</strong>, and (2) a <strong>successor</strong> function, which returns <code>n + 1</code> for any number <code>n</code>. To represent numbers as functions, then, we require that <code>z</code> (zero) and <code>s</code> (successor) be passed in as arguments, and go from there. Each number is actually secretly a function of those two inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>zero = λs. λz. z
one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)
three = λs. λz. s (s (s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual details of how to implement zero and successor should be implemented as are left as someone else’s problem — we can survive without them. All we care about is that our numbers do the right thing, given whatever zero and successor someone may provide.</p>

<p>What about <strong>addition</strong>? Addition is a function that takes in two numbers (let’s call them <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), and produces a number representing their sum. To sum them together, we’ll want to produce a number that applies <code>s</code>, the successor function, a total of <code>x + y</code> times. For example, we could first apply it <code>y</code> times to the zero, then apply it <code>x</code> more times to that result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try proving that one plus one equals two. In λ-calculus, this proof looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)

plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))

plus one one = (λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))) one one
             = λs. λz. one s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s ((λs. λz. s z) s z)
             = λs. λz. s (s z)
             = two
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Long, but at least conciser than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Bertrand Russell’s</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="lambda-circuitry">Lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>There are a lot of lambdas, parentheses, and arguments being pushed around in that proof. Mentally matching up parentheses is annoying. Scope is especially annoying: which <code>s</code> am I looking at again in <code>λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)</code>, the inner one or the outer one?</p>

<p>A linear string of lambdas and parentheses is an ineffective way to provide intuition for the computations that are taking place. This problem isn’t unique to lambda calculus, either; consider trying to represent a binary tree using a linear string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Node(2, Node(7, Leaf(2), Node(6, Leaf(5), Leaf(11))), Node(5, None, Node(9, Leaf(4), None)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unambiguous, but not very intuitive. Contrast that representation with the diagram we use when we’re trying to explain that same binary tree at a chalkboard, a more visual notation:</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg/288px-Binary_tree.svg.png" alt="Binary tree diagram, from Wikipedia"></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_tree.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</em></p>

<p>I remember programming constructs better when I can reason about them visually like this: when I imagine cutting an array in half for binary search, when I imagine pointers in a linked list being shuffled around to insert a new element, and when I imagine traversing up and down the branches of a binary tree.</p>

<p>Why can’t lambda calculus get some visual intuitions, in the same way? Lambda calculus is a dance of variables flowing through and being manipulated by functions, and I want a writing system for lambda calculus that will visually display this dance. It shouldn’t look like strings of parentheses and symbols: it should create visual intuition.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, here is the system I came up with. I aimed for something that would resemble circuitry.</p>

<p><strong>Values</strong> flow along wires, where they may be passed in as arguments to functions or applied as functions themselves. Some are inputs, some are outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Functions</strong> are represented as boxes which are applied to their inputs on one side and produce a single output on the other. The notation must indicate which function is applied; this may either be drawn within the box itself, or wired in to the middle of the box from some other value.</p>

<p><strong>Arguments</strong> are represented as inputs, coming in from the right side of the diagram; these arguments might pass through functions, or they might be functions-to-apply themselves. If an argument has not been passed in yet, it’s an empty arrow beginning a wire; if an argument has been passed in, its value is attached to the wire. Arguments are always passed in from top to bottom, in order.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s a function which takes in two functions, <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, then a value <code>x</code>, and returns <code>f (g x)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f-g-x.png" alt="lambda f. lambda g. lambda x. f (g x)"></p>

<p>As another example, here’s the M combinator <code>M = λx. x x</code> (the “mockingbird” in <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1P096Y"><em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em></a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/m-combinator.png" alt="lambda x. x x"></p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-circuitry">Church numerals, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>Here’s the Church numeral <code>four = λs. λz. s (s (s (s z)))</code>, drawn out in lambda circuitry:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-four.png" alt="Four, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Let’s take that proof from earlier that one plus one is two. What does it look like to draw that proof in lambda circuitry, instead?</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-oneplusoneistwo.png" alt="Proof that one plus one is two, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also consider <strong>multiplication</strong>. A multiply function would take in two numbers, m and n, and computes a new number which is their product. In lambda calculus, we’d write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>multiply = λm. λn. λs. λz. m (n s) z
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the notation of lambda circuitry, this looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply.png" alt="Multiplication function, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Using this function, we can check that <code>multiply 2 3</code> evaluates to <code>6</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-1.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-2.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-3.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 3"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-4.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 4"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-5.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 5"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<h2 id="sidenote-de-bruijn-indices">Sidenote: De Bruijn indices</h2>
<p>One of the nice things about lambda circuitry is that it completely removes the need for variable names.</p>

<p>There’s another notation for lambda calculus that does this too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index"><em>De Bruijn indices</em></a>. A lambda expression written with De Bruijn indices indicates which variables are used where with a positive integer; the smaller the integer, the more recently the argument it refers to was passed in.</p>

<p>For example, the identity function <code>λx. x</code> may be written with De Bruijn indices like so:</p>



<p>The Church numeral for two, <code>λs. λz. s (s z)</code>, may be written like so:</p>



<p>The addition function, <code>λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))</code>, may be written like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An evaluation of <code>plus one one</code> looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus one one = (λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1) (λ λ 2 1)
             = (λ (λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 ((λ λ 2 1) 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (2 1)
             = λ λ 2 (2 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the tricky things about writing a lambda calculus interpreter is getting the renaming rules right; De Bruijn indices are convenient because they remove the need for this. Lambda circuitry is similar in spirit to De Bruijn indices in that it doesn’t require variable names at all, but instead indicates which variables are passed where by connecting values directly to an arrow indicating when they were passed in.</p>

<h2 id="argument-switching-function-in-lambda-circuitry">Argument-switching function, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>I’ll provide more examples just to further demonstrate how the notation works in different situations. Let’s consider the “argument-switching” function <code>C</code>, where <code>C f x y</code> returns <code>f y x</code>. (This is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,C,K,W_system">C combinator</a>.)</p>



<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator.png" alt="C combinator"></p>

<p>Suppose we try applying this to a silly function <code>f</code> where <code>f x y</code> discards <code>y</code> and just returns <code>x</code>. Then, <code>C f</code> should switch around <code>f</code>‘s arguments and create a function which returns <code>y</code> instead. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>f = λx. λy. x

C f = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) f
    = λx. λy. f y x
    = λx. λy. (λx. λy. x) y x
    = λx. λy. y
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f.png" alt="f = lambda x. lambda y. x"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-1.png" alt="C(f), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-2.png" alt="C(f), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-3.png" alt="C(f), step 3"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also try a function <code>g</code> where <code>g x y</code> returns <code>x y</code>. Then <code>C g x y</code> should return <code>y x</code>. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g = λx. λy. x y

C g x y = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) g x y
        = g y x
        = (λx. λy. x y) y x
        = y x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-g.png" alt="g = lambda x. lambda y. x(y)"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-1.png" alt="C(g), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-2.png" alt="C(g), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-3.png" alt="C(g), step 3"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-4.png" alt="C(g), step 4"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p><em>Exercise</em>: Show that applying <code>C</code> twice reverses it. That is, show that <code>C (C f)</code> returns <code>f</code>, for any <code>f</code>.
(Note that <code>C f</code> is a function which takes in two arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and returns <code>f y x</code>. Applying <code>C</code> only to <code>f</code> like this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial application</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="prior-work">Prior work</h2>
<p>There are some other systems that give visual intuition to lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/"><em>To Dissect a Mockingbird</em></a> describes a notation that is actually very similar to the one I’ve described, and demonstrates it on various problems from <em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em>. I like the way this looks, especially how every function is enclosed by two halves of a circle which make it obvious how that function might be applied. My notation doesn’t have this feature, but requires drawing fewer enclosing boxes as a result.</p>

<p>Visual Lambda (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/visual-lambda/">code</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/visual_lambda_bubble_notation.gif">basics</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf">paper</a>) represents lambda expressions as colored bubbles, and provides an interface for manipulating them.</p>

<p><a href="http://worrydream.com/AlligatorEggs/">Alligator Eggs</a> is a description of a puzzle game based on lambda calculus, which also happens to provide a visual way of working with and evaluating lambda expressions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html">jsonb</a> is, undeniably, <em>king</em>. It is a very flexible data
type, that allows for unstructured/schema-less storage. It has very powerful
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html#JSON-INDEXING">indexing mechanisms</a>, and its internal
representation is reasonably compact and efficient. It comes with advanced operators and expressions to query/extract
parts of it, and has
<a href="http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/talks/jsonb-roadmap-pgcon-2020.pdf">recently seen the addition of SQL/JSON path</a>
functionality to extend that to comply with the SQL Standard.</p>
<p>There are countless posts and resources explaining the virtues of this data type and what you can accomplish with it. So
nothing else to add, except to reiterate my appreciation for all those who have worked on creating and contributing to
it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch. <code>jsonb</code> supports… just JSON! That’s great, but is it enough?</p>
<h2 id="json-data-types">JSON data types</h2>
<p>JSON is a container data type, which means it can store other data types contained within. And which data types it does
support? From the <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON Spec</a>, it supports the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number, which is a quite flexible “numeric” data type.</li>
<li>String.</li>
<li>Boolean.</li>
<li>Null.</li>
<li>Array, or probably better called a “bag” or “container”, a sequence of elements of, possibly, mixed types.</li>
<li>Object, a collection of key-value pairs, where the value may be any other JSON data type.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>jsonb</code> maps these JSON data types, internally, to Postgres types. It is easy to see the resolved (JSON) data types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>select</span> <span>key</span>, value, jsonb_typeof(value) <span>from</span> jsonb_each(
<span>'{"a": 42, "b": true, "c": "hi", "d": null, "e": [42, "hi"], "f": {"a": 1}}'</span>
);

<span>└─────┴────────────┴──────────────┘</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Scalar types are mapped to boolean, text and numeric. Essentially, three different data types. Now check
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html">all the data types available in Postgres</a>. There are dozens. And
obviously you can extend with your own. Isn’t it a bit limiting that, in essence, you need to conflate any existing data
type to either a <code>numeric</code> or a <code>text</code>? What if you want to represent a timestamp? Convert it to text (well, Postgres
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/3ed2005ff595d349276e5b2edeca1a8100b08c87/src/backend/utils/adt/jsonb.c#L45">does it for
you</a>,
but you get the point). What about a <code>inet</code>, or a <code>point</code>? What about my <code>custom-amazing-data-type</code>?</p>
<p>According to the JSON spec, this is correct and there’s nothing else to do. So the question is not about whether <code>jsonb</code>
has any implementation flaws, but if Postgres users are enough with “just JSON”.</p>
<p>I find it particularly frustrating having to store binary data (<code>bytea</code>) in a JSON. Since there’s no <code>bytea</code> data type in
JSON (nor <code>jsonb</code>, consequently) you need to convert it to a text representation. There are several solutions, none of
them a good enough one:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Convert it to a string, byte by byte. Probably a very bad option, as it suffers two main problems: one is that
Postgres strings, not being strictly UTF-8 comformant (and this is a topic for another blog post…), cannot store the
UTF-8 null (<code>\0</code>) character. As such, if one of those bytes had the 0 value (likely), it could not be stored. Second,
a sequence of bytes interpreted as a string does not have the same ordering as the original byte sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encode in <code>base64</code>. Other than the extra space, ordering is not preserved (i.e., an index on the original byte
sequence would yield a different order than an index on the base64-encoded text). The solution is to use expression
indexes on the decoded value, if order needs to be preserved. This adds overhead anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encode in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32#base32hex">base32hex</a>, an even more verbose encoding but that
preserves order. There are no functions in Postgres for this encoding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-beyond-json">Looking beyond JSON</h2>
<p>So how would you store other specific, more compact, or benefit from existing functions from additional datatypes, with
current JSON and <code>jsonb</code>? The only option to avoid data type information erasure is to encode the data type as part of
the JSON string. Something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
	<span>"key1"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"inet"</span>, <span>"value"</span>: <span>"10.0.0.0/8"</span>},
	<span>"array"</span>: [<span>3</span>, {<span>"key2"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"point"</span>, <span>"value"</span>: <span>"(42, -42)"</span>}<span>]</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>It is easy to see the several drawbacks of this approach: much more verbose and storage needs; need to continuously
cast; and need to do conditional casts depending on the data type.</p>
<p>I’m not alone in the pursue of a more generic, supporting more data type JSON-like language, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/">MongoDB’s BSON</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_(serialization_format)">Amazon’s ION</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBJSON">Universal Binary JSON</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.LowLevelAPI.html">DynamoDB’s Item HTTP
API</a>.
This is a very interesting case, as it is a JSON-compliant input/output interface, with type definition following an
approach similar to the one outlined above (where the value is an object which includes both the type and the value
itself), but which is claimed to be stored internally in an optimized form (not as-is). It has interesting composite
types like “homogeneus arrays”, where are elements must be of the same time or sets, which forbid duplicated values.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.ongres.com/img/blog/post_jsonb.jpg" alt="Beyond jsonb: a generalized jsonb supertype for Postgres?"></p>
<p>So how would such a generalized unstructured data type work in Postgres? I’d say it could leverage all the existing
jsonb infrastructure. After all, jsonb already knows each element’s data type, so this just needs to be extended to
many, potentially arbitrary data types (to support custom data types too). As such, new data types should be easy to
add. Other features (like ensuring homogeneus-ness across array elements for supporting sets; or ensuring uniqueness
within an element) may require some differentiation. Being a superset, I’d expect the same codebase could accommodate
well both data types (a similar retrofit was performed in the past from <code>hstore</code> to use <code>jsonb</code>'s codebase).</p>
<p>One of the main requisites is that this generalized unstructured data type would be a super set of the actual JSON, so
that any JSON string (and consequently <code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code> values) can be converted to it implicitly. I envision the
hardest parts, or at least the ones that may trigger more discussion, to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze existing JSON-superset data types and deciding on the set of features to implement.</li>
<li>Selecting the data types to support, if not <em>all</em>.</li>
<li>Input syntax? Some ideas:
<ul>
<li>Use different value enclosing depending on the data type. E.g. <code>key: {{ dmFsdWU= }}</code> (Amazon Ion).</li>
<li>Wrap the value in constructor-like syntax, like MongoDB shell: <code>key: NumberLong(42)</code>.</li>
<li>Turn values into a nested JSON object with type (document’s key) and value, similar to DynamoDB’s HTTP API:
<code>"key": { "N": "42" }</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the hardest one: pick the name of the new datatype!</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you think? <strong>Should Postgres get a JSON-superset data type, a generalized unstructured data type</strong>?  Leave
your comments and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/ongresinc">tweet your responses to @ongresinc</a> to start the conversation.</p>

<p><em>Personal note</em>: I find it hard to understand why Oleg Bartunov, one of the most significant contributors to JSON in
Postgres, among many other features,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/">was recently demoted from being a “Major Contributor” to a “Contributor”</a>.
Not only I believe major contributions cannot be taken back; but in this particular case it feels even harder to understand. Let
this be my public call to ask to revert this situation and provide proper public recognizement for

<p>I'm a science fiction writer, so I quite enjoy thinking about self-driving cars. They make for really interesting analogies about data, liability, self-determination, information security and openness.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write fiction about this! Deakin University commissioned "Car Wars," a short story about the sociotechnological issues raised by autonomous vehicle thought-experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>(they also got a faculty member to write a quiz for it whose correct answers take a 180' different view to my own!)</p>
<p>And without any spoilers here, I'll say that subverted, lethal autonomous vehicles are a key plot point in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book, coming out in Oct.</p>
<p><a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/">https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/</a></p>
<p>But I'm a science fiction writer and that means I can tell the difference between "thought experiments" and "real things." Alas, the same cannot be said of corporate America.</p>
<p>For example, according to its own IPO filings, Uber can only be profitable if it invents fully autonomous vehicles and replaces every public transit ride in the world with them.</p>
<p>Elon Musk – a man whose "green electric car company" is only profitable thanks to the carbon credits it sells to manufacturers of the dirtiest SUVs in America, without which those planet-killing SUVs would not exist – makes the same mistake.</p>
<p>Musk wants to abolish public transit and replace it with EVs (he says that public transit makes you sit next to strangers who might be serial killers, which tells you a lot about his view of humanity).</p>
<p>Now, both Uber and Musk are both wrong as a matter of simple geometry. Multiply the space occupied by all those AVs by the journeys people in cities need to make by the additional distances of those journeys if we need road for all those cars, and you run out of space.</p>
<p>It's a trivially modelable Red Queen's Race, in which the more cars you add, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need…</p>
<p>Indeed, these fairy tales require so much credulity to be taken seriously that they strain even the car-addled imaginations of American automotive culture, and also rely on the irrational exuberance inspired by imaginary self-driving cars to propagate and persist.</p>
<p>But that exuberance is sorely misplaced. Machine learning systems have brittle and unpredictable failure modes that can be triggered by accident or deliberately. The unconstrained problem of navigating busy cities with unquantifiable human activities is insoluble with ML.</p>
<p>Or, at least, it's insoluble if you care about whether cars kill even more people in even less predictable ways than they do now.</p>
<p>This is a lesson that Ford CEO Jim Hackett just learned the hard way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html">https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html</a></p>
<p>After investing heavily in the technology and boasting about how Ford's future was a bet on the imminent arrival of AVs, Hackett has had to admit that "We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles."</p>
<p>The company has sunk $4b into the technology. But there's gotta be a pony under there somewhere:</p>
<p>"When we bring this thing to market, it's going to be really powerful." -Hackett</p>

<p>Genomist Adam Rutherford is a gifted science communicator; the podcast he co-hosts, "The Curious Cases of Rutherford and Fry" is one of the best popular science programs I've ever heard: charming and informative at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads</a></p>
<p>His 2017 book "A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived" used a survey of the state of the art in genomics to present an account of what we knew about human relatedness.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html">https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html</a></p>
<p>The most compelling part of "Brief History" was Rutherford's skewering of junk DNA sciecne, especially the home ancestry/genetic testing industry, with its claims of being able to tell you if you're 32% viking and if so, which red wine you're genetically programmed to enjoy.</p>
<p>These sections are written with Rutherford's characteristic empathy – as someone who'd dedicated his life to genomics, he understands the impulse to connect your DNA with your life story – but they also warn about the harms arising from these false beliefs.</p>
<p>These harms are the subject of his new book, HOW TO ARGUE WITH A RACIST, a bestseller in the UK, just published in the US with new forematter updated in light of both the pandemic and the BLM uprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/">https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/</a></p>
<p>Superficially, the "race science" promulgated by white supremacists – often repeated by people who should know better, sometimes internalized by racialized people who are harmed by this pseudoscience – has the ring of plausibility.</p>
<p>Whether that's the fairy tales about "race" and ability ("Jews are smart because of medieval money-lending laws" or "Black people perform well in sports because of the slave trade's selective breeding") or the studies grouping humanity into races based on genetic divergence.</p>
<p>Chances are you've encountered this stuff and not known what to make of it but thought it benign or at least neutral. But sociologists have scraped white nationalist message-boards to document the centrality of this stuff to the rise of a new movement of would-be genociders.</p>
<p>"How to Argue" is a point-by-point rebuttal to these race realists. Despite the title, Rutherford doesn't really expect that you'll convince someone who's obsessed with whether they have "Jewish genes" or who worships their ability to break down lactose with his arguments.</p>
<p>Those people, after all, are motivated reasoners. They've started from the end-point – "appearances and life circumstances notwithstanding, I am superior and deserve better" – and worked their way backwards to justify that story to themselves.</p>
<p>As Jonathan Swift wrote (and as Rutherford quotes): "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into."</p>
<p>But it's not just motivated reasoners who absorb this garbage. There's a whole business model built on selling people junk DNA science that makes "race science" regrettably spreadable.</p>
<p>That's where Rutherford is aiming: people who've assumed that 23andme and its rivals wouldn't be able to make millions selling you diagnoses of the precise quantity of viking DNA in your blood if there wasn't something to it.</p>
<p>And here Rutherford shines. He is, after all, a gifted science communicator. This is one seriously <em>charming</em> book, funny and witty and just flat-out fascinating.</p>
<p>Rutherford doesn't merely want to disabuse you of the fantastical claims of Junk DNA Science – he wants to excite you about the incredible NEW things we're learning thanks to the rapid advances in genomics.</p>
<p>Like the fact that Africa is the most genetically diverse place on Earth, with two members of the Sen tribe from different regions being more genetically divergent than a Swede and an Australian Aboriginal person.</p>
<p>And the fact that you only need to go back 11 generations before you reach an ancestor whose DNA is likely completely missing from your own genome. Or the small number of centuries you have to look back before you find the first common ancestor of every European.</p>
<p>And the amount of genetic outflow and backflow between seemingly isolated places – Bronze Age Africa and Europe, say – and the waves of migration we can trace through genomes that eliminate any claim to national genetic commonality in any land.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what role genomics plays in the dominance of people from east Africa in footraces, or the number of Jewish Nobelists, Rutherford's here for you, unpicking what we know about the role of genes in these attainments (spoiler: they're not that important).</p>
<p>All leavened with gentle and devastating dunks on "race science" believers and the wit of Douglas Adams in his prime.</p>
<p>It may not help you win arguments with racists – they cannot be reasoned out of what they weren't reasoned into.</p>
<p>But it a powerful innoculant against the ideas drifting out of their foetid pits and into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The Heroes Without Limits project was created by disability advocate Sara Thompson, "producing and streaming real play tabletop games with an all-disabled/chronically ill/neurodivergent cast and crew."</p>
<p>Thompson's work also includes creating homebrew RPG add-ons "roleplay and address disability" in your own games.</p>
<p>A recent addition is the Combat Wheelchair, rules for integrating wheelchair using adventurers into your Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition games:</p>

<p>Combat Wheelchairs' obvious, manifest coolness has not prevented gatekeeping yum-yukkers from raising spurious objections to them, and these are addressed in the homebrew rules.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

</p>
<p><em> <strong>Content warning:</strong> Discussion of social justice, discussion of violence, spoilers for Jacqueline Carey books.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p><em> <strong>Edit 10/25:</strong> This post was inspired by a debate with a friend of a friend on Facebook who has since become somewhat famous. I’ve renamed him here to “Andrew Cord” to protect his identity.</em>
</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Andrew Cord <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/02/on-some-criticism-of-lesswrong/" rel="nofollow">criticizes me</a> for my bold and controversial suggestion that maybe people should try to tell slightly fewer blatant hurtful lies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just find it kind of darkly amusing and sad that the “rationalist community” loves “rationality is winning” so much as a tagline and yet are clearly not winning. And then complain about losing rather than changing their tactics to match those of people who are winning.
</p>
<p>Which is probably because if you *really* want to be the kind of person who wins you have to actually care about winning something, which means you have to have politics, which means you have to embrace “politics the mindkiller” and “politics is war and arguments are soldiers”, and Scott would clearly rather spend the rest of his life losing than do this.
</p>
<p>That post [ <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/17/lies-damned-lies-and-social-media-part-5-of-%e2%88%9e/" rel="nofollow">the one debunking false rape statistics</a> ] is exactly my problem with Scott. He seems to honestly think that it’s a worthwhile use of his time, energy and mental effort to download evil people’s evil worldviews into his mind and try to analytically debate them with statistics and cost-benefit analyses.
</p>
<p>He gets *mad* at people whom he detachedly intellectually agrees with but who are willing to back up their beliefs with war and fire rather than pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense.
</p>
<p>It honestly makes me kind of sick. It is exactly the kind of thing that “social justice” activists like me *intend* to attack and “trigger” when we use “triggery” catchphrases about the mewling pusillanimity of privileged white allies.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, if a fight is important to you, fight nasty. If that means lying, lie. If that means insults, insult. If that means silencing people, silence.
</p>
<p>It always makes me happy when my ideological opponents come out and say eloquently and openly what I’ve always secretly suspected them of believing.
</p>
<p>My natural instinct is to give some of the reasons why I think Andrew is wrong, starting with the history of the “noble lie” concept and moving on to some examples of why it didn’t work very well, and why it might not be expected to work so well in the future.
</p>
<p>But in a way, that would be assuming the conclusion. I wouldn’t be showing respect for Andrew’s arguments. I wouldn’t be going halfway to meet them on their own terms.
</p>
<p>The respectful way to rebut Andrew’s argument would be to spread malicious lies about Andrew to a couple of media outlets, fan the flames, and wait for them to destroy his reputation. Then if the stress ends up bursting an aneurysm in his brain, I can dance on his grave, singing:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>♪ ♬ I won this debate in a very effective manner. Now you can’t argue in favor of nasty debate tactics any more ♬ ♪
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to do that, but if I <em>did</em> it’s unclear to me how Andrew could object. I mean, he thinks that sexism is detrimental to society, so spreading lies and destroying people is justified in order to stop it. I think that discourse based on mud-slinging and falsehoods is detrimental to society. Therefore…
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>But really, all this talk of lying and spreading rumors about people is – what was Andrew’s terminology – “pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense”. You know who got things done? The IRA. They didn’t agree with the British occupation of Northern Ireland and they weren’t afraid to let people know in that very special way only a nail-bomb shoved through your window at night can.
</p>
<p>Why not assassinate prominent racist and sexist politicians and intellectuals? I won’t name names since that would be crossing a line, but I’m sure you can generate several of them who are sufficiently successful and charismatic that, if knocked off, there would not be an equally competent racist or sexist immediately available to replace them, and it would thus be a serious setback for the racism/sexism movement.
</p>
<p>Other people can appeal to “the social contract” or “the general civilizational rule not to use violence”, but not Andrew:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And don’t give me that nonsense about the police. I’m sure a smart person like you can think of clever exciting new ways to commit the perfect murder. Unless you do not believe there will <em>ever</em> be an opportunity to defect unpunished, you need this sort of social contract to take you at least some of the way.
</p>
<p>He continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Scott calls rhetorical tactics he dislikes “bullets” and denigrates them it actually hilariously plays right into this point…to be “pro-bullet” or “anti-bullet” is ridiculous. Bullets, as you say, are neutral. I am in favor of my side using bullets as best they can to destroy the enemy’s ability to use bullets.
</p>
<p>In a war, a real war, a war for survival, you use all the weapons in your arsenal because you assume the enemy will use all the weapons in theirs. Because you understand that it IS a war.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of things I am tempted to say to this.
</p>
<p>Like “And that is why the United States immediately nukes every country it goes to war with.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why the Geneva Convention was so obviously impossible that no one even bothered to attend the conference”.
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/22/apart-from-better-sanitation-and-medicine-and-education-and-irrigation-and-public-health-and-roads-and-public-order-what-has-modernity-done-for-us/" rel="nofollow">to this very day</a>, we solve every international disagreement through total war.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why Martin Luther King was immediately reduced to a nonentity, and we remember the Weathermen as the sole people responsible for the success of the civil rights movement”
</p>
<p>But I think what I am <em>actually</em> going to say is that, for the love of God, if you like bullets so much, stop using them as a metaphor for ‘spreading false statistics’ and go buy a gun.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>So let’s derive why violence is not in fact The One True Best Way To Solve All Our Problems. You can get most of this from <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1619491702/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1619491702&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slastacod-20&amp;linkId=AYGYZKSORVSJ52VW" rel="nofollow">Hobbes</a>, but this blog post will be shorter.
</p>
<p>Suppose I am a radical Catholic who believes all Protestants deserve to die, and therefore go around killing Protestants. So far, so good.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there might be some radical Protestants around who believe all Catholics deserve to die. If there weren’t before, there probably are now. So they go around killing Catholics, we’re both unhappy and/or dead, our economy tanks, hundreds of innocent people end up as collateral damage, and our country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So we make an agreement: I won’t kill any more Catholics, you don’t kill any more Protestants. The specific Irish example was called the Good Friday Agreement and the general case is called “civilization”.
</p>
<p>So then I try to destroy the hated Protestants using the government. I go around trying to pass laws banning Protestant worship and preventing people from condemning Catholicism.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, maybe the next government in power is a Protestant government, and they pass laws banning Catholic worship and preventing people from condemning Protestantism. No one can securely practice their own religion, no one can learn about other religions, people are constantly plotting civil war, academic freedom is severely curtailed, and once again the country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So again we make an agreement. I won’t use the apparatus of government against Protestantism, you don’t use the apparatus of government against Catholicism. The specific American example is the First Amendment and the general case is called “liberalism”, or to be dramatic about it, “civilization 2.0”.
</p>
<p>Every case in which both sides agree to lay down their weapons and be nice to each other has corresponded to spectacular gains by both sides and a new era of human flourishing.
</p>
<p>“Wait a second, no!” someone yells. “I see where you’re going with this. You’re going to say that agreeing not to spread malicious lies about each other would also be a civilized and beneficial system. Like maybe the Protestants could stop saying that the Catholics worshipped the Devil, and the Catholics could stop saying the Protestants hate the Virgin Mary, and they could both relax the whole thing about the Jews baking the blood of Christian children into their matzah.
</p>
<p>“But your two examples were about contracts written on paper and enforced by the government. So maybe a ‘no malicious lies’ amendment to the Constitution would work if it were enforceable, <em>which it isn’t</em>, but just <em>asking</em> people to stop spreading malicious lies is doomed from the start. The Jews will no doubt spread lies against <em>us</em>, so if we stop spreading lies about them, all we’re doing is abandoning an effective weapon against a religion I personally know to be heathenish! Rationalists should win, so put the blood libel on the front page of every newspaper!”
</p>
<p>Or, as Andrew puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So let’s talk about how beneficial game-theoretic equilibria can come to exist even in the absence of centralized enforcers. I know of two main ways: reciprocal communitarianism, and divine grace.
</p>
<p>Reciprocal communitarianism is probably how altruism evolved. Some mammal started running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat" rel="nofollow">TIT-FOR-TAT</a>, the program where you cooperate with anyone whom you expect to cooperate with you. Gradually you form a successful community of cooperators. The defectors either join your community and agree to play by your rules or get outcompeted.
</p>
<p>Divine grace is more complicated. I was tempted to call it “spontaneous …</p></div></div>

        <blockquote><p>Just because your state or city allows you to bring staff back to the office doesn’t mean that the facilities are ready for them to work safely. Here’s what you need to consider before employees return – assuming you can convince them to do so. Don’t count on that.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a now-common tale: The developers and the rest of the company staff have been working at home since March. For the most part, things have gone well enough. After <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-qa-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/">some initial glitches</a>, the team is productive, reasonably happy (given the additional stress), and their goals are met.</p>
<p>However, the day is coming when you no longer have to keep everyone out of the office. You can bring them back. Or can you?</p>
<h3>Decorating the petri dish</h3>
<p>Before you bring staff back to a shared space, you have to comply with a new bunch of rules about office work to meet post-covid-19 guidelines. While the specific details may differ where you are, all of the new workplace rules include social distancing requirements. Almost certainly, your pre-covid-19 workplace doesn’t allow for six feet of space between workers.</p>
<p>The changes aren’t trivial. You need <a href="https://theconversation.com/goodbye-to-the-crowded-office-how-coronavirus-will-change-the-way-we-work-together-137382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical reconfiguration of work areas</a>. Desks need to be farther apart, possibly with barriers between work stations. (So much for <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/sgc-research-when-moving-to-an-open-office-plan-pay-attention-to-how-your-employees-feel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the alleged benefits of collaboration</a> in an open office.) Because you probably don’t have space to move everyone apart, you need to decide whether you need everyone in the office at the same time – which means cultural impacts that are as important to think about as building airflow.</p>
<p>Let’s assume for the moment that you <em>do</em> want to bring people back into the corporate headquarters – or that you need to, for reasons of security. Here are the adjustments to make now, before people return to their commutes.</p>
<h3>Beyond office space</h3>
<p>According to Marina Vaamonde, CEO of real estate investment firm <a href="https://propertycashin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PropertyCashin.com</a>, companies have to arrange for more parking than they had pre-Covid. The reason, she explains, is that <a href="https://time.com/5869375/public-transit-coronavirus-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fewer workers are willing to share space on public transportation</a>. “People want to drive their own cars into work, so you need more parking,” she points out.</p>
<p>The office itself needs <a href="https://vicuspartners.com/articles/6-office-design-trends-post-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a significant redesign</a>. “You need to have airflow and outdoor space,” Vaamonde explains. “Now that all of the communal indoor spaces are closed or used for offices, people want to have an outdoor area where they can meet and breathe fresh air.”</p>
<p>In fact, says Giridhara Raam M, product evangelist at <a href="https://www.zohocorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoho Corporation</a>, protecting employees requires a complete rethinking of the office itself. “Considering most of the work spaces operate with a centralized air conditioning system, it is better to avoid it. Work spaces need to be redefined; cubicle systems and socially distanced seating spots with free air flow should be adopted at least for a year. Open offices are even more satisfying than closed spaces, due to droplets.”</p>
<p>The physical configuration of the office has to change. “Cubicles are coming to an end,” Vaamonde says, because they don’t allow for social distancing.</p>
<p>But while barriers can be built around the cubicles, Vaamonde believes they won’t be necessary. The employees won’t be there to use them.</p>
<p>Expect big central offices, such as the ones in downtown Houston where Vaamonde works, to remain mostly empty. Employers may move to smaller offices in the suburbs, she predicts. “They will be more like coworking spaces where you have spaces for a day.” The newly-envisioned office will have more open space, providing larger areas where social distancing can be maintained.</p>
<p>All that assumes your employees are ready to come into the office, however. Don’t count on that.</p>
<h3>You might <em>want</em> employees to return to the office. Good luck with that plan</h3>
<p>Your staff has been <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-human-backup-establishing-the-teams-unlikely-successors/">working at home for nearly six months</a>. Many of those people are disinterested in coming back to an office for work. Others may feel that they only need to come into the physical plant occasionally, when they need access to services that are only available in the office, such as a specific test platform that can’t be reached via a cloud connection. And with so many cloud services nowadays, those are rare.</p>
<p>Sarah Riegelhuth, CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.growmyteam.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grow My Team</a>, which specializes in hiring and engaging remote professionals, thinks that the ultimate resolution is for workforces to be mostly remote. “This allows people to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/5/15/21258793/bay-area-exodus-silicon-valley-san-francisco-facebook-google-apple-twitter-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live where they want to be</a>,” she says. It also permits flexible schedules, and other practices that enable staff to be more productive. (One reason: less time lost in social interactions.)</p>
<h3>Still: Some jobs do require on-site participation</h3>
<p>Businesses were forced to accept telework due to the pandemic. But that doesn’t mean everyone in every company can work from home in the long term. Manufacturing jobs, field support, and many service jobs must be done where the work actually is. Employees who deal with intellectual property and personally identifiable information may need to schedule their work so they address sensitive data on their few days in the office.</p>
<p>And there are other factors. This includes choosing which job functions should return to work first.</p>
<p>“Only the data critical roles should return back to corporate premises first, due to security concerns,” says Raam. “Others can stay back and facilitate remote work.” The critical resources can work in shifts assuring there are limited people inside a defined area.</p>
<p>In many cases, the end result is likely to be a mix of in-office workers and people continuing to work from their couches.</p>
<p>Ready or not, you have to change operations to deal with employees who will work at home permanently. Your management, HR, and IT systems need to adjust to a higher percentage of full-time telecommuters, for whom working from home is a better option. It’s your job to find a way to make that work.</p>
<p>That has a significant impact on office IT systems. For example, redefined work spaces mean that workstation locations will change, which affects how office computers connect to the network even if everything is wireless.</p>
<p>Likewise, the business needs to bring communication and security requirements for remote workers up to corporate standards. This may mean providing dedicated lines for employees who don’t have home internet service. Or the company may need to pay for a level of service beyond what the employee might otherwise need. Or a better chair.</p>
<p>Once you admit that the work-at-home phase isn’t temporary, the company may need to provide computers and software if employees are currently using personal computers or laptops. One reason is physical security. When employees use their own computers for work, it’s hard to prevent them from using the same devices for everything from their family’s homework to grocery shopping. The business computer needs client security and communications security products, such as corporate-grade VPNs, firewalls, or network security equipment.</p>
<h3>Split culture</h3>
<p>Finally, there’s the question about how corporate culture affects workers when they’re at home. Office politics will change, if only because it’s hard to get people involved in back-stabbing when their backs are back at home. “The reality is that there’s still a culture,” Riegelhuth says. “In my experience, the culture evolves.”</p>
<p>In many cases, some parts of the corporate culture, notably office politics, are diminished, which helps productivity. In others, such as the informal back channels that help decision making, the impact on the culture may be problematic. But Riegelhuth notes that there are ways to keep back channels and brain storming alive.</p>
<p>“We have a vision, we have a purpose and we have our values. We have a weekly team meeting where everybody comes on to Zoom,” Riegelhuth says. “We get an hour of face time every week.”</p>
<p>“One of the advantages that we’ve seen is looking at our health and wellbeing,” Riegelhuth adds. “Taking sick days used to be frowned on. It used to be a badge of honor not to take sick days.” Now, she says, the company culture has changed to make health and wellbeing important parts of her company’s culture.</p>
<p>There’s a general agreement among both managers and experts that remote working is here to stay. While some employees will always need to be in the building, most won’t. And in many cases, the company will organize itself so that it functions solely online. Some employees need to come to the office occasionally, some on a regular basis and a few most of the time.</p>
<p>But for office workers, the daily 9 – 5 in the building is a thing of the past. It may take some organizations a while to figure that out, but home will be where the heart, and the job, is.</p>
<blockquote><p>While you’re making changes, contemplate the who-does-what questions. For example, have you considered creating a Chief Quality Officer? <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/why-your-enterprise-needs-a-cqo-chief-quality-officer/">Our white paper</a> goes into the details.</p></blockquote>

                    twitter bots</a> post in real-time whenever they detect aircraft
                flying in circles over cities around the world, including Los Angeles, Baltimore, Portland, Minneapolis,
                and London. The bots often tweet about news and fire aircraft, and because they use an uncensored source
                of data they also tweet police, FBI, DHS, DEA, CBP, and military
                aircraft. They look for circles because it means an aircraft is <i>doing something</i> instead of
                <i>going somewhere</i>. If you've ever asked “what is that helicopter/plane?” there’s a good chance my
                bots can answer your question—even if it's an advanced military surveillance plane:

                A few years ago I <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sowJrQQfgxnLCErb-CvUV8VGXdtca6SWYWWLRPZgaHI/edit?usp=sharing">discovered
                    a secret FBI aerial surveillance program</a>, involving more than 100 aircraft
                registered to front companies. I was one of the first people to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9508812">post online</a> about the program.
            </p>
            <p>From a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150605064602/http://fusion.net/story/143739/how-you-can-track-the-fbis-spy-planes/">Fusion
                    Media
                    article</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                This week, the Associated Press reported that the FBI is regularly flying “spy planes” over American
                cities.

                The report, which revealed the front companies the FBI uses to fly the planes, wasn’t a surprise to John
                Wiseman, a technologist in Los Angeles. Based on public records, he had already figured out some of the
                planes the FBI was flying and, using a
                device he programmed to intercept airplane transmissions, had identified over the last month the ones
                flying overhead in L.A. in real time.
                Wiseman wrote in a Hacker News comment in May about his findings, revealing a month ago what the AP
                reported today.

                I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1238149529469202433">Siri shortcut</a> that
                lets you ask what's overhead at any time, and it will tell you what
                the nearest aircraft is and who it's registered to. It uses the same uncensored data source as
                the Advisory Circular bots.

            <p>
                I’ve spent hundreds of hours in development work trying to bring the public this essential
                information for free. I'd like to continue this work, both supporting existing projects and implementing
                new ideas (I'd also like to replace my broken laptop).

            </div>
            <p>Oddly, I don't remember when or how I got my hands on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.toshiba-memory.com/products/toshiba-wireless-sd-cards-flashair-w-04/">Toshiba <em>FlashAir</em></a> card. These WiFi-enabled SD cards are made to transfer photos from a digital camera to a computer.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Imaginging that someone would use a 4MBps wireless connection to transfer photos when the hardware transfer is closer to 70MBps seems ridiculous.</p>
              <p>However, it could come in handy if you're in a situation where you don't have access to an SD card reader, or want to easily preview photos on a phone or tablet.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              <h3>Digging into the <em>FlashAir</em></h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>What's far more interesting about these Toshiba cards is the fact that they are essentially programmed to act as a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">wireless access point (WAP)</a>. You can setup a custom SSID and password— connecting directly to the card over 2.4GHz.</p>
              <p>After peeking at the filesystem, I realized that the main photo gallery application hosted on the card is essentially a static website— served as basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>My excitement with this bit of tech was the possibility of building a totally discrete microserver that would be capable of hosting a few pages and services.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Project Inspiration</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>My fourth-year undergraduate architecture studio, entitled <em>Dark Rooms</em>, was taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://m-a-u-s-e-r.net/">Mona Mahall</a>. The studio was split into three exhibitions: <em>Pyramid, Server and Backstage</em>. These exhibitions were meant to explore the "spaces between visibility and invisibility".</p>
              <p>In the second exhibition, <em>Server</em>, we were asked to consider the design of an anti-human space— a dark, cold, electronic archive built exclusively for machines. In my preliminary research, I was particularly interested in artists like <a target="_target" href="https://arambartholl.com/dead-drops/">Adam Bartholl</a>.</p>
              <p>His project, a USB "<a target="_blank" href="http://deaddrops.com/">dead drop</a>", drew inspiration from an information-sharing tactic used by spies. A predetermined secret location— such as a hollowed-out rock, brick, log or other object— would be used to discreetly stash an important item.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Once the item— perhaps a slip of paper or a key— is "dropped", a second party could then retrieve it without interacting directly with the other person or being detected in the exchange.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Wireless Anonymous Repository</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>While a USB is already a much more "invisible" way of storing and exchanging information, I wanted to take this concept a step further. Using the <em>FlashAir</em> cards, I proposed a new wireless dead drop that could be just as affordable and simple as the USB, but with a myriad of superior qualities.</p>
              <p>Writing directly to the card requires an SD card slot; however, the wireless functionality can be powered without a desktop or laptop. A typical SD card takes 2.4-3.6V at about 30mA. I found that by using an SD-to-USB adapter, one could power the wireless module from a standard 5V USB outlet.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Depending on the location of the dead drop, this could be concealed within a false junction box that would be plugged in over the top of a standard 2-outlet 120V AC. If— in the spirit of the original USB dead drop— you wanted to embed the card in a brick wall, then the device could be powered from a USB powerbank.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>I named the project <em>warTOR</em> for "wireless anonymous repo" + <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">TOR</a>. Though it's not connected to the Tor network in any way, I thought this title captured the spirit of anonymity (plus I wanted to use some Pokémon sprites). If someone would like to try it, the Toshiba cards <em>can</em> be setup as a wireless bridge... from a Tor gateway?</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>Something else that I'd like to try is powering the card via a small solar cell, but I haven't gotten there yet... The greatest benefit of the wireless dead drop is that one could log into the WAP from their cellphone, upload or download a file, and no one could discern that any sort of exchange was happening. However, I'm also working on a clientside chat application that could be hosted on the cards.</p>
              <p>With this implemented, then two people could sit down in a café and send messages back and forth over the private network; or, someone could login to the network and type out a message for the other person to see at a later date.</p>
            </div>

            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Here are some screenshots from the application 👆. I'll be doing a follow-up post with a GitHub link to the <em>FlashAir</em> CONFIG file that I'm using on my card. I'll also upload the source code for the original <em>warTOR</em> server with instructions on how you can deploy your own <em>warTOR</em> in the wild!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>Yubikeys are great for security, but their benefits decrease somewhat when you leave them in your computer unattended.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I unfortunately have a habit of forgetting my key when I walk away from the computer. I also have login passwords that are way too long and easy to typo.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s a way to solve both of these problems: use a Yubikey to unlock your computer when you put it in and lock your computer when you remove it!</p>
<h2 id="prior-art">Prior art<a href="#prior-art" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The first example I remember seeing of this concept years ago was <a href="https://www.predator-usb.com/predator/en/index.php">Predator</a>, Windows software (with a delightfully retro website) that locks your computer when you remove a special USB drive. Similar examples for Linux include <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/pamusb">pamusb</a>, which allows you to login using Linux’s PAM by inserting a specially-formatted USB stick.</p>
<p>Of course, nowadays most people use Yubikeys to accomplish this, and Yubico has <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/Authentication_Using_Challenge-Response.html">convenient guides</a> on how to accomplish this very task. However, I wanted to make it <em>touchless</em> – that is, I wanted to be able to plug in my Yubikey and instantly unlock my laptop, without clicking through logins or touching the Yubikey button. Upon removal, I wanted to instantly lock my computer.</p>

<p>There are some guides on how to do this online (unlock when you plug in, lock when you remove), but unfortunately most of them fall prey to the problem described in <a href="https://medium.com/@d0znpp/how-to-sacrifice-security-using-a-public-yubikey-linux-guides-c823c4c6e2">this article</a>. A lot of them use udev to detect when the Yubikey is plugged in, but they don’t actually authenticate the key beyond checking its vendor ID, model ID, and sometimes serial number, which all can <a href="https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/changing-creating-a-custom-serial-id-on-a-flash-drive-low-level-blocks.2099116/">easily be faked</a>.</p>
<p>To provide actual security, most official guides use either <code>pam_u2f</code> (which authenticates a Yubikey through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor">U2F protocol</a>) or <code>pam_yubico</code> (which uses either online validation through YubiCloud or offline validation through a challenge-response protocol). The U2F method requires a tap on the Yubikey, while the challenge-response process can be done without user interaction, so I went with the latter. I set up traditional Yubikey authentication using <a href="https://support.system76.com/articles/yubikey-login/">this great guide from System76</a>.</p>
<p>However, I still needed some way to test the challenge-response for success when I plugged in the key. Usually, <code>pam_yubico</code> is run when you login or unlock your computer (i.e. when pressing the enter key on the lockscreen). But I didn’t want <em>any</em> clicks, so I needed a way to run it without interaction.</p>
<p>Enter <code>udev</code> (again) and <code>pamtester</code>!</p>
<p>Here’s the udev rules I included:</p>
<pre><code>kevin@you:~ » cat /etc/udev/rules.d/yubikey.rules
ACTION=="remove", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407*", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ykunlock.sh lock"
ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{ID_BUS}=="usb", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407*", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ykunlock.sh unlock"
</code></pre><p>These rules effectively call a script when inserting and removing the key, so I can trigger any action from the script. Note that the script <strong>should not immediately unlock the computer</strong>, to avoid the security issues mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>To actually test the challenge-response from the Yubikey on inserting, I decided to use <a href="http://pamtester.sourceforge.net/">pamtester</a>, a simple utility that pretends to trigger a PAM authentication from the command line. Since <code>pam_yubico</code> is installed, this will naturally test the challenge-response if a Yubikey is plugged in.</p>
<p>Here’s the final script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>exec 1&gt; &gt;<span>(</span>logger -s -t <span>"</span><span>$(</span>basename <span>"</span>$0<span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> 2&gt;&amp;<span>1</span>
echo <span>"RUN"</span>
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span>$1<span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"lock"</span> <span>]</span>; <span>then</span>
        pkill -USR1 swayidle
<span>else</span>
        <span># unlock</span>
        <span>if</span> echo <span>""</span> | pamtester login kevin authenticate; <span>then</span>
                <span># PAM login successful</span>
                <span># kill locker</span>
                kill -KILL <span>$(</span>pgrep swaylock<span>)</span>
                ps aux | grep swaylock
                <span># turn on displays</span>
                SWAYSOCK<span>=</span><span>$(</span>ls /run/user/1000/sway-ipc.*.sock<span>)</span> swaymsg <span>"output * dpms on"</span>
        <span>fi</span>
<span>fi</span>
exit <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>On lock, it immediately locks my desktop (by sending a SIGUSR1 to swayidle, the program that manages locking on the Sway window manager)</li>
<li>On unlock, it first sees if it can authenticate using pamtester without interaction (when no Yubikey is inserted or if the key is invalid, pamtester asks for a password). If it can, it kills the lockscreen and turns on all displays using Sway WM protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final result is amazingly convenient, and has successfully made me remember to pull out my Yubikey when leaving my computer unattended more than once<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>! Mission success.</p>

<p>I’ve significantly downgraded this statement in severity after some excellent comments on Hacker News have pointed out that (1) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24192390">stealing a Yubikey is incredibly unlikely unless you’re a person of interest</a>; (2) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24192138">even if you have the Yubikey, you still can’t directly extract e.g. a private key</a>; and (3) a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24190313">Yubikey protects against SSH/GPG fraud because it can require a PIN and lock out over time</a>. Case in point, Yubikeys are good. I’d argue that it’s still not good to have your key stolen (e.g. perhaps if you’re targeted by a government/<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24194081">industrial espionage</a>, or the malicious significant other attack, where they know your password and can steal your key for 2FA if unattended), but I see that it’s not as much of a risk as I originally thought. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new study has found that 13% of people think of themselves as pathological liars, or say that others consider them to be pathological liars. Those 13% reported telling about 10 lies per day.</p><p>The study, published in the journal <a href="https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20190046#.XvDDrEQ2jzE%20">Psychiatric Research and Clinical Practice</a>,&nbsp;included 623 people. The researchers recruited them in 2019 from various mental health forums, social media, and a university.</p><p>The participants spanned a range of ages, ethnicities, education levels, and income levels. The researchers asked them whether they thought of themselves as pathological liars, or if others thought of them that way. The respondents also took a lie frequency assessment and other questionnaires.</p><h2>Greater distress and impaired functioning</h2><p>The study found the pathological liars were more likely to experience distress and impaired functioning, especially in social relationships. This diminished functioning also applied to legal contexts, work, and finances. Their distress often had to do with worries about whether their lies would be be discovered.</p><p>The pathological liars in the group also reported telling lies for no specific reason, and said many of their lies grew out of an initial lie.</p><p>The majority of participants in the pathological liars group indicated that their problematic lying began during adolescence. People in this group were also more likely to say their lying was out of their control, indicating a kind of compulsiveness. Likewise, people in this group said they felt less anxious after lying.</p><h2>From <em>pseudologia phantastica</em> to pathological liars</h2><p>The phenomenon of the “pathological liar” was first recorded in 1891 by psychiatrist <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/pathologische-L%C3%BCge-psychisch-abnormen-Schwindler/dp/3226034618/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;qid=1594994372&amp;refinements=p_27%3AAnton+Delbr%C3%BCck&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anton Delbr?ck</a>. He initially called it <em>pseudologia phantastica</em>, and used the term to describe people who told so many outrageous lies that their behavior could be considered pathological.</p><p>Since then, research into pathological lying has been surprisingly scant. One <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1988.tb05068.x">analysis</a> of prior case studies found <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_lying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pathological lying</a> equally represented among men and women, with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://psychnewsdaily.com/category/iq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IQs</a> of the liars in the average to above average range.</p><h2>Formal recognition</h2><p>Pathological lying has not (yet) been classified as a diagnostic entity in either the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DSM-5</a> or the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ICD-10</a>, but the researchers behind the present study are hoping to change that.

</p>


<p>
I recently gave a talk at work to help introduce OpenBSD to my
colleagues. It's a broad introduction to the fundamentals of security
in OpenBSD, as well as some basic system administration tips and
suggestions anyone coming from a Linux background might find useful.
</p>
<p>
It's roughly split up into four sections; the history of OpenBSD,
what sets it apart from other operating systems, a guided
installation, and the system administration introduction.
</p>
<p>
In the original presentation the guided installation was done
interactively with the participants installing OpenBSD in a VM on
their machines to follow along with the slides.
</p>
<p>
I've tried my best to make it as accessible as possible while still
covering the most important beats. If you find any errors please let
me know so I can correct them, my contact info is on the <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/about/">about</a> page.
</p>
<p>
I've corrected several small issues with the slides since the
recording. I've replaced the file name <code>/etc/mygateway</code> with <code>/etc/mygate</code>,
replaced the smartquotes with regular quotes, and removed the rebound
program, to name the biggest fixes. These corrections are available at
the slides linked below.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<date>Published: 2020-08-15 | Categories: <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/engineering"><span>[»]</span> Engineering</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/optics"><span>[»]</span> Optics</a></b>and<b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/programming"><span>[»]</span> Programming</a></b>.</date>
<p>4 Months and 400 hours were necessary to bring life to the Spectrum Analyzer software that I am glad to announce to you today.</p>

<p>The software, which was initially modest, has grown into a fully functional program suite that covers most of the features traditionally implemented in commercial spectroscopy software. It includes single and live acquisition of spectra, loading/saving and export to clipboard, filtering, baseline removal and an automated calibration algorithm that I specially designed for the occasion. A screenshot of the software performing a calibration is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<figure><img src="http://www.thepulsar.be/images/spectrum-analyzer-software-for-openraman/screenshot.png"><figcaption>Figure 1 – Spectrum Analyzer software screenshot</figcaption></figure>

<p>A <a href="http://www.open-raman.org/build/software/" target="_blank"><span>[∞]</span> specific page</a> was created on the companion website to host the latest version of the software for download. As the rest of the project, the software is distributed under the open-source CERN OHL-W v2 license.</p>

<p>Although the software was designed to interface to the OpenRAMAN spectrometers, it will actually work with any dispersion-based spectrometers using PointGrey camera. It may even work with different camera manufacturers or with CCD linear array as long as you provide a DLL to interface to the hardware. The source code is given with a the DLL necessary to interface to PointGrey cameras, which can be used as an example on how to implement other camera types. The program even support multiple spectrometers connected to the same computer using each a different hardware! I don’t know if that will actually be useful but I made it as flexible as possible to avoid restrictions that would later block some users.</p>

<p>The software will work with either .CSV files or with a custom file format that I implemented using an upgraded version of the technique I presented <a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/article/implementing-object-persistence-in-c--"><span>[»]</span> here</a>. One of the most challenging difficulty I had to face was to allow 32 bits version of the software to load the files saved with the 64 bits version. This seems easy at glance but the original technique I developed do not cope well with that. One advantage of the custom file format is that the files contains the data, the blank and all the program settings (filtering, calibration etc.) so that you can tweak them later.</p>

<p>As explained above, the software also features an automated calibration procedure. You simply measured the spectra of a Neon or Argon-Mercury lamp, give the number of peaks that appears on screen and click on the “calibrate!” button. The algorithm is extremely robust to missing peaks and converge to a solution within a few seconds (4 seconds on my super-old laptop). By default, the algorithm will look on a very broad range of parameters, which basically cover the whole visible region of the spectrum, but advanced user can also tune the settings when necessary.</p>

<p>The software also implements many other features like time-lapsed acquisitions to monitor reactions, automatic saving of spectra, baseline removal algorithm and Savitzky-Golay filtering. The user can also freely choose between wavelength and Raman shifts axis, save and import calibration data etc. Also, the calibration will be saved inside the camera so if you connect the spectrometer to a different computer it will remain calibrated!</p>

<p>I invite you to test the software to discover all the possibilities. You don’t have to possess a spectrometer to run the software as you can import any .CSV file where the first column represents the x-axis and the second column the y-axis.</p>

<p>During the next weeks/months, I will post detailed articles on how the major features were implemented. The first article will be about the automated calibration procedure.</p>

<p>I would like to give a big thanks to <b>James</b> who has supported this post through Patreon. I also take the occasion to invite you to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thepulsar" target="_blank"><span>[∞]</span> donate</a> through Patreon, even as little as $1.

<p> Modern computer hardware is amazing. Manufacturers have orchestrated billions of pieces of silicon into terrifyingly complex and efficient structures that sweep electrons through innumerable tangled paths, branchings, and reunions with the sole purpose of performing computations at more than a billion times per second. This awe-inspiring piece of computational wizardry has at its disposal multiple billions of uniquely addressible silicon plates where it can store the results of millions of computations in an array of several vanishingly small chips. All of this hardware, though each component often sits no further than 7 or 8 centimeters away from the others, cycles so fast that the speed of light, a physical law of the universe, limits the rate at which they communicate with each other.
</p><p><span>So why is software still slow?</span>
</p><p>Why does it take your operating system 10 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute to boot up? Why does your word processor freeze when you save a document on the cloud? Why does your web browser take 3, 4, 10 seconds to load a web page? Why does your phone struggle to keep more than a few apps open at a time? And why does each update somehow make the problem worse?
</p><p><span>We made it slow</span>.
</p><p>Not necessarily you, not necessarily me, not necessarily any single person in particular. But we, the software development community, made it slow by ignoring the fundamental reality of our occupation. We write code, code that runs on computers. Real computers, with central processing units and random access memory and hard disk drives and display buffers. Real computers, with integer and bitwise math and floating point units and L2 caches, with threads and cores and a tenuous little network connection to a million billion other computers. Real computers not built for ease of human understanding but for blindingly, incomprehensibly fast speed.
</p><p><span>A lot of us have forgotten that</span>.
</p><p>In our haste to get our products, our projects, the works of our hands and minds, to as many people as possible, we take shortcuts. We make assumptions. We generalize, and abstract, and assume that just because these problems have been solved before that they never need to be solved again. We build abstraction layers, then forget we built them and build more on top.
</p><p>And it's true that many of us think we do not have the time, the money, the mental bandwidth to always consider these things in detail. The deadline is approaching or the rent is due or we have taxes to fill out and a manager on our back and someone asking us why we always spend so much time at the office, and we just have to stick the library or virtual machine or garbage collector in there to cover up the places we can't think through right now.
</p><p>Others of us were never taught to think about the computer itself. We learned about objects and classes and templates and how to make our code clean and pretty. We learned how to write code to make the client or the manager or the teacher happy, but made the processor churn. And because we did, that amazing speed we'd been granted was wasted, by us, in a death by a thousand abstraction layers.
</p><p><span>But some of us aren't satisfied with that.</span>
</p><p>Some of us take a few extra steps into the covered territory, the wheels sitting, motionless, in a pile behind us, examine their designs and decide there is a better way. The more experienced among us remember how software used to be, the potential that we know exists for computer programs to be useful, general, <em>and</em> efficient. Others of us got fed up with the tools we were expected to use without complaint, but which failed us time and time again. Some of us are just curious and don't know what's good for us. Don't trust what we've been told is good for us.
</p><p>We sat down and looked at our hardware, and examined our data, and thought about how to use the one to transform the other. We tinkered, and measured, and read, and compared, and wrote, and refined, and modified, and measured again, over and over, until we found we had built the same thing, but 10 times faster and incomparably more useful to the people we designed it for. And we had built it by hand.
</p><p>That is what Handmade means. It's not a technique or a language or a management strategy, it isn't a formula or a library or an abstraction. It's an idea. The idea that we can build software that works with the computer, not against it. The idea that sometimes an individual programmer can be more productive than a large team, that a small group can do more than an army of software engineers and *do it better*. The idea that programming is about transforming data and we wield the code, the tool we use to bend that data to our will.
</p><p> It doesn't require a degree, or a dissertation, or a decade of experience. You don't need an
expensive computer or a certificate or even prior knowledge. All you need is an open mind and a sense of
curiosity. We'll help you with the rest.
</p><p><span>Will you join us?</span>
</p><p>Will you build your software by hand?</p>

		<p><em><span>A</span></em><span><em><span>n Ecology of Mind</span></em></span><span> </span><span> is a film portrait of Gregory Bateson, celebrated anthropologist, philosopher, author, naturalist, systems theorist, and filmmaker, produced and directed by his daughter, Nora Bateson.</span></p>
		<p><span>T<span>he</span></span><span> film includes footage from Bateson’s own films shot in the 1930s in Bali (with Margaret Mead) and New Guinea, along with photographs, filmed lectures, and interviews.  His youngest child, Nora, depicts him as a man who studied the interrelationships of the complex systems in which we live with a depth motivated by scientific rigor and caring integrity.</span></p>
		<p><span>N<span>ora</span></span> Bateson’s rediscovery of his work documents the vast – and continuing – influence Bateson’s thinking has had on the work of an amazingly wide range of disciplines.  Through contemporary interviews, along with his own words, Bateson’s way of thinking reveals practical approaches to the enormous challenges confronting the human race and the natural world.</p>
		<p><span>G<span>regory</span></span> Bateson’s theories, such as “the double bind” and “the pattern which connects”, continue to impact the fields of anthropology, psychiatry, information science, cybernetics, urban planning, biology, and ecology, challenging people to think in new ways.   </p>
		<p><span>U</span><span>ntil now, his work has been largely inaccessible to most of us.  Through this film, Nora Bateson sets out to show that his ideas are not just fodder for academic theory, but can help instruct a way of life. She presents his thinking using a richly personal perspective, focusing on the stories Bateson used to present his ideas and how the beauty of life itself provided the framework of his life’s pursuits.</span></p>
		<p><span>T</span><span>his film hopes to inspire its audience to see our lives within a larger system - glistening with symmetry, play, and metaphor. An invitation to ask the kinds of questions that could help thread the world back together from the inside.</span></p>

<p>Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200809222648/https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/">writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty hard, but Google has been at it a while. Let’s see how well Google is doing by asking it for some basic factual information, like the slowest animal.</p>

<p>Google says it’s the three-toed sloth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-google.png" alt="Google search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>To see just how wrong this is, take a look at this video of a sloth climbing a tree:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNnWhQPQRFQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Can you imagine a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest_organisms#Animals">1 millimeter snail</a> moving this quickly? A sponge? A coral? A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">tardigrade</a>? A 100-micron long mite?</p>

<p>It takes almost no research at all to see that the sloth wouldn’t even be invited to the slowest animal Olympics, let alone win the gold medal.</p>

<p>Google has plenty of company though.</p>

<p>Siri guesses that it’s the <em>two-toed</em> sloth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-siri.png" alt="Siri search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Bing returns images of sloths, but text saying it’s the seahorse:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-bing.png" alt="Bing search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Cortana returns text saying three-toed sloth while its first image is a Gila monster:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-cortana.png" alt="Cortana search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Although DuckDuckGo doesn’t elevate an editorial snippet, it returns 8 images of sloths and 1 image of a loris:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-duckduckgo.png" alt="DuckDuckGo search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>YouTube’s top hit for animals used to say seahorse, but today says the three-toed sloth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-youtube.png" alt="YouTube search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>WolframAlpha gets it the closest yet, returning the brown garden snail and explicitly states that it reinterpreted my query as the slowest <em>land</em> animal:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-wolfram-alpha.png" alt="Wolfram Alpha search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Wikipedia returns an article with slowest animal by phylum and class, including coral with a speed of 0 m/s:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-wikipedia.png" alt="Wikipedia search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>I find it quite interesting that of the 8 websites I asked, the only website that got the answer partially correct was the also the only website that’s a non-profit.</p>

<p><strong>2020 update:</strong> Despite being higher quality than all results returned by search engines, the Wikipedia article was deleted for being too low quality. Alas.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been a software engineer a while now and I can say this with confidence - it is fun. It’s great and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. It’s so much fun that some folks try to capture the most enjoyable elements and put them into games.</p>

<p>I’ve played two such games. The first is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/">Shenzhen.io</a></strong>. This one looks similar to what an engineer working on embedded devices would see. You solve puzzles by writing assembly code on low power devices. What makes this game great is that they remove the annoying parts of writing and shipping code.</p>

<ul>
<li>The requirements are clear, rarely true on the job.</li>
<li>The edit-debug-compile loop is lightning quick. That combined with a great test suite means you can try several potential solutions in a minute.</li>
<li>The platform your code depends on (the game itself) doesn’t have bugs. You don’t need to fix your dependencies before you start on your own code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should a software engineer play Shenzhen.io? The gameplay isn’t for everyone. For some people it feels too much “like work”. At the end of the day you want to relax, not work at tasks that feel similar to what you did for 8 hours. Despite that, I think it’s worthwhile just to see how much more fun a task becomes when the requirements are clear and developer tools are fast. Everyone knows that investing in our direction and our tools will help, but having fun playing this game reinforces that feeling.</p>

<!-- There's a great article about Shenzhen.io that I couldn't quite work in - https://probablydance.com/2016/11/07/lessons-learned-from-shenzhen-io/ -->

<p>The second game is <strong><a href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a></strong> which released last Friday, though it has been available as an early access preview for about 4 years now. Those who’ve played it are probably scratching their heads right now - this is a game about building a factory, not coding. You work with conveyor belts, metals, oil products to craft products necessary to make a spacecraft.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqaAjgpsoW8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>And yet, this game reminds me of software engineering more than any other. Let me explain why.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technical debt</strong>. Do we hack it for now or do we implement it right? The answer as always - it depends. Hacking it gets us closer to our goals right now but we have to pay off the debt eventually. Novice players (like me!) start out connecting various parts of our base by conveyor belts till our base resembles spaghetti, similar to poorly maintained codebases. Eventually we learn techniques to tame this complexity so our base/codebase becomes easier to reason about.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</strong>. One of those techniques is reducing duplication. If you have a component that’s needed in multiple places, do you make it once and use it everywhere or do you copy paste in each place it’s needed? The answer is “it depends”. As an engineer, sometimes you use a library while other times you copy paste. It depends on the complexity of the component - a couple of functions can be copy pasted while something complex probably shouldn’t. So it is in Factorio, a certain component (electronic circuits) was being produced in 4-5 places. I eventually replaced them all with one centralised production array to simplify the factory.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling</strong>. A repeated theme in this game is building a production array and later finding we need 3-5x the throughput. The first few times this happens, it requires redoing from scratch. After we wise up, we start design our arrays with space for scaling up. So it is with software - our systems need to scale to many more users, sometimes without much warning. We design our systems keeping that in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Rebuilding</strong>. When we’re rebuilding a component in a single player game or a personal software project we don’t usually care if the component or the whole system stops working briefly. I was playing multiplayer with friends though, so I tried to make sure components I was working on didn’t break anything else. I created a new oil refinery system, shifted existing customers to the new one before decommissioning the old one. Zero downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong> to find root causes. Our factory is far from perfect, so something is always breaking as we add stuff to it. Finding the root causes of these issues is tricky, especially when fixing those leads to other problems, like playing whack-a-mole. An example from yesterday - We don’t have enough electricity, so we add more boilers, but now the water pipes need fixing. Then the water is fine, but we don’t have enough coal. That mirrors real life</li>
<li><strong>Teamwork</strong>. Most things are possible solo given enough time. But it’s quicker and more fun working with a team you like. We were able to move fast by splitting responsibilities among the team. We have one oil guy (me), one trains guy, one secretary of defense, among other roles. The others don’t care about the internals of the refinery system, just the interface - they use the outputs and let me know if it’s broken. It’s the same on large software projects - everyone can’t learn the intricacies of the whole system. Instead everyone learns the APIs of all components while a few are responsible for the implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Researching</strong>. We spend most of our time exploiting our existing knowledge to keep us in our local maxima of output. However, a smart player dedicates some time to learning new techniques. In our game, coal power wasn’t working out for us and I had dismissed nuclear power as an option because we didn’t have enough uranium ore. I looked into it again when we were desperately short of power and producing too much pollution. Turns out even a little ore is enough to power the base for a 100 hours if we do it right. It’s the same with software - our existing stack probably works well, but it’s smart to see what’s out there and possibly learn from others. New team mates can help here too - everything is new to them so they’re spending more time than you on learning. They can come across stuff that we didn’t know about and use that knowledge to find a higher maxima. A fresh pair of eyes is always good.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>. You can do most things manually, it just takes time. But if you’re doing something repeatedly, it should be automated. The game gently eases you towards this idea by requiring a few items be automated. It gets better later in the game you unlock construction robots. You can tell them the layout of the production array you’ve designed, give them the materials and they will construct it for you. This reminded me of AWS CloudFormation and similar tools - although it’s possible to set up servers by hand, it’s quicker and less error prone to specify the end state and let a tool do it for us. But if you’ve developed software, you know that automation isn’t just a means to an end - it’s an end in and of itself. We do it because it makes us happy, even if we do too much of it and <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">forget what we were doing in the first place</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Putting out fires</strong>. Sometimes it’s hard to implement new features because we’re being pulled away to deal with alerts - all too common on software engineering teams. The typical solution is to have one team member deal with alerts while the rest focus on adding features. That’s we did in the game too.</li>
</ul>

<p>But more than any one thing, the game is about managing complexity. Designing a specification and implementing systems that fulfill that specification. Maintaining and growing that system over time.</p>

<p>IMO, playing Factorio will not make you a better software engineer. But if you’re a software engineer, you’ll likely find the game fun. And conversely, if you’re good at the game you should give software engineering a shot.</p>

<p>You can get Factorio at on the <a href="https://factorio.com/">official website</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/">Steam</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://factorio.com/download">free demo</a>, in case you’d like to try before you buy. (Just one thing - don’t wait for a sale. This game has never gone on sale and possibly never will.)</p>

	<p>
		If you're around my age, you'll remember Windows Minesweeper. It was one of several games included with Windows back in the day to try to train users in the use of the then-newfangled â€˜mouseâ€™. It doesnâ€™t come with Windows any more. You can get Minesweeper for Windows 10, but the developers haveâ€¦ made some choices.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you havenâ€™t played it, Minesweeper is a grid of squares, some of which have mines underneath, and your job is to click on all the others. If you click on a mine, you lose. You can also flag squares with the right mouse button to record that you think they are a mine. Your only clue as to where the mines are is that when you click on a square that isnâ€™t a mine, it tells you how many of the eight adjacent squares are mines. If that number is zero, the game automatically clicks on all the adjacent squares for you so you can get a little patch to start from. Hopefully that will include a 1 in a tight corner so thereâ€™s only one place its mine can go, and that will complete a nearby 1 so you can get some more numbers to work from, eventually leading you to complete the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		If youâ€™re not so lucky, you might not get a solvable board. A common situation is that you get down to the last two spaces and you know one of them is a mine but thereâ€™s no wat to predict which one. You have to guess. Heads you win, tails you just wasted 10 minutes carefully clearing the whole board only to be scuppered by a forced guess.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/mines.html">Thereâ€™s a version of Minesweeper that guarantees you never have to guess</a>, which is very nice. It neatly solves the problem of unwinnable games, and while I find that always knowing you can make a deduction can be too big a clue, in regular Minesweeper you could even lose straight off the bat â€” you have to guess the first move and maybe itâ€™ll be a mine. In this case, Windows Minesweeper quietly chooses a different arrangement of mines and pretends like you got lucky after all â€” but it doesnâ€™t do that if youâ€™re stuck at the <em>end</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		So what if we went further? Below is a version of Minesweeper where you will <em>never</em> be penalised when forced to guess. Any time there simply isnâ€™t enough information to deduce a safe move, weâ€™ll pull Windowsâ€™s trick and quietly rearrange the mines so you donâ€™t get penalised.
	</p>
	<p>
		But since that would on its own make the game too easy, the flip side of this coin is that if you <em>can</em> in theory deduce a safe move but guess anyway, the code will quietly rearrange the mines so that your unnecessary risk backfires and you lose.
	</p>
	<p><label>Width </label>
		<label>Height </label>
		<label>Mines </label>
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This game is also rigged to give you a zero on your first click rather than simply a non-mine space. To be honest this is mostly to avoid situations that are computationally difficult â€” this is not what I would call carefully optimised code. If I wanted to expand this I would (eg) make it precalculate things while youâ€™re staring at the screen instead of waiting for you to choose a square and then trying to work out what to do about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		More importantly, I would like to make the game recognise when thereâ€™s a forced guess _coming_ â€” currently if thereâ€™s a 50/50 chance in one corner of the grid that youâ€™re clearly going to have to take eventually, you have to wait until thatâ€™s <em>all</em> there is. If you take the chance when there was a safe space available elsewhere, youâ€™ll always lose.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I was feeling especially mean, I could insist that the player choose the square with the best odds of being safe, rather than simply judging whether or not each square is theoretically knowable. But I think that would be taking things too far.
	</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> Neuroscientists at EPFL and the University of Edinburgh have discovered that the degree of motivation and the stamina to keep it up depends on the ratio between the neurotransmitters glutamine and glutamate in the nucleus accumbens of the brain.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>There is no question that motivation is one of the hardest and yet important factors in life. It’s the difference between success and failure, goal-setting and aimlessness, well-being and unhappiness. And yet, why is it so hard to get motivated – or even if we do, to keep it up?</p><p>That is the question that scientists led by Professor Carmen Sandi at EPFL and Dr Gedi Luksys at the University of Edinburgh have sought to answer. The researchers worked off previous knowledge that told them two things: First, that people differ a lot in their capacity to engage in motivated behavior and that motivational problems like apathy are common in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Second, to target an area of the brain called the “nucleus accumbens”.</p><p>Sitting close to the bottom of brain, the nucleus accumbens has been the subject of a lot of research. The reason is that it was quickly found to be a major player in functions like aversion, reward, reinforcement, and motivation.</p><p>To test and quantify motivation, the EPFL team designed what is known as a “monetary incentive force task”. The idea is that participants perform a task with increasing – and measurable – effort and get paid sums of money that correspond to their effort. Basically, do more and get paid more.</p><p>In this study, 43 men were scanned to measure–metabolites in the nucleus accumbens in their brains with a sophisticated brain-imaging technique called “proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy”, or <sup>1</sup>H-MRS. This can specifically measure the abundance of neurochemicals in the brain, such as neurotransmitters and metabolites. Because of this <sup>1</sup>H-MRS is used even in clinical settings to determine neurological disorders.</p><p>Subsequently, each participant was asked to squeeze a device that measures force – a dynamometer – to a given level of contraction in order to earn either 0.2, 0.5, or 1 Swiss franc. This procedure was repeated for a number of 120 consecutive trials, which made performance in the task quite demanding.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Du-EkGwPRnA?rel=0" width="640"></iframe></p><p><em>Illustration of the hand-grip force exertion task.

Then, during task performance, in each trial, they had to squeeze it up to a force threshold of 50% of their maximal voluntary contraction and maintained at that force for another 3 seconds in order to earn the particular monetary incentive ascribed to each trial.

The scientists also ran the experiment under isolation and group conditions to investigate the influence of competition on performance.</p><p>Once they had gathered the behavioral data, the researchers processed it through a computational model that estimated the most appropriate parameters that should be measured with regard to utility, effort, and performance functions. This allowed them to interrogate whether particular neurotransmitter levels predicted specific motivational functions.</p><p>The analysis revealed that the key to performance – and, by extension, motivation – lies within the ratio of two neurotransmitters in the nucleus accumbens: glutamine and glutamate. Specifically, the ratio of glutamine to glutamate relates to our capacity for maintaining performance over a long period of time – what the researchers term “stamina”.</p><p>Another discovery was that competition seems to boost performance even from the beginning of the task. This was especially the case for individuals with low glutamine-to-glutamate ratios in the nucleus accumbens.</p><p>“The findings provide novel insights in the field of motivation neuroscience,” says Carmen Sandi. “They show that the balance between glutamine and glutamate can help predict specific, computational components of motivated performance. Our approach and data can also help us develop therapeutic strategies, including nutritional interventions, that address deficits in effort engagement by targeting metabolism.”</p><p><em>Professor Carmen Sandi’s lab is part of EPFL’s </em><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/bmi/"><em>Brain Mind Institute</em></a><em>, situated in the </em><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv"><em>School of Life Sciences</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Other contributors</strong></p><ul><li>EPFL Center for Biomedical Imaging</li><li>EPFL Laboratory of Functional and Metabolic Imaging</li><li>ICM Institute for Brain and Spinal Cord</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><!-- .entry-header --><div><p>Recently I migrated this website over to WordPress.org. I tried to set it up so I could use my WordPress site with Github Pages. This post details the tribulations I faced while doing so.

I liked this old setup because it was simple and free. I also liked Jekyll’s plain, minimal look. Jekyll’s visual style is very barebones and that’s exactly what I wanted.</p><p>My old workflow for editing and publishing posts was simple. I’d open a text editor, write a post in Markdown, and build and run my website locally to test the changes. Next, I’d push the new post to Github, where I’d re-deploy my website with the changes.</p><p>I first started to get annoyed with this setup when I had to re-remind myself how Jekyll glued together and rendered my site each time I wanted to publish a post. I got even more annoyed when I wanted to make changes to the layout. For example, I tried and failed multiple times to add a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag to the head of my <code>index.html</code> file. This theoretically should have been a very simple change.&nbsp;</p><p>If this happened once or twice, I’d be fine with it. The bigger problem is that the purpose of my website is to encourage me to write more. I started to procrastinate writing because there was always some small thing I wanted to fix with Jekyll first. Then, when I made time to tinker around with Jekyll, I was annoyed that I spent more time doing that than actually writing.</p><h2 id="requirements"><strong>Requirements for a new solution</strong></h2><p>So, I decided to make it was time to change my setup. My new setup had to fulfill just two requirements:</p><ol><li><strong>Easy content management. </strong>I really like the idea of just writing something, editing it, and then hitting a button to publish it once it’s ready. I didn’t like diving into Ruby files just to fix configuration issues, deploy issues, UI issues, etc. (what was happening with Jekyll).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be a writing first experience. </strong>I’ve never quite liked writing in text editors. Something about it just doesn’t <em>feel</em> right, though I can’t put my finger on exactly what.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I decided to go with WordPress because it seemed like it fulfilled both of those requirements really well. Also <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> is free, unlike Webflow and Ghost, two alternatives I considered that are both quite pricey ($20/month for Webflow and $29/month for Ghost) and loaded with a bunch of features I don’t need yet.</p><h2 id="mistakes"><strong>Two big initial mistakes</strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, previously I used Github/Github Pages to host and serve my website. Github was free and worked great, so I wanted to rig up my WordPress setup to also use Github and Github Pages.&nbsp;</p><p>The only requirement to use Github Pages is that your site has to be static. Some light Googling showed me that there were a few plugins that converted WordPress site files to static pages. There were even <a href="https://www.hywel.me/static/site/wordpress/2016/07/17/fast-free-static-website-with-wordpress-and-github-pages.html">a few tutorials</a> describing how to do this, so I was confident this would be possible. That was my first big mistake.</p><p>Next, I began figuring out how to get WordPress to run locally. That was my second big mistake. My logic here was simple. Previously with Jekyll, I’d run my website locally, add my changes, and then push the new version of my website to Github to redeploy it. Thus, if I wanted to use WordPress with Github and Github Pages, then I should run my WordPress site locally, add my changes, and then push the new version of the site to Github.&nbsp;</p><p>While this logic wasn’t bad, I really should have tested the core assumption that it relied on first (the fact that the WordPress site <em>could</em> be converted into a static website). Or I should have done a bit more research than just some “light Googling” before venturing into a solution and stubbornly refusing to give up.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="warning"><strong>A warning (because hindsight is 20/20)</strong></h2><p>Here’s what I know now: running WordPress locally is a nightmare. Successfully figuring it out was way harder than it should have been. If you’re trying to do this yourself, don’t. You most likely don’t need to, and there’s probably another solution you can use to get to what you want.&nbsp;</p><p>(I should also caveat that I know almost nothing about Apache, MySQL, FTP, and PHP. If you’re familiar with them, then you might not have the same issues. However, I really don’t think I should have needed to learn about all of those technologies just to set up WordPress locally.)</p><h2 id="run-locally"><strong>The treacherous journey to run WordPress locally</strong></h2><p>First, I downloaded WordPress.org and installed it locally. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/installing-wordpress-on-your-own-computer/">official WordPress installation page</a> implied that I also needed some combination of Apache, MySQL, and PHP. A few of the links on that page were broken, a red flag that I promptly ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>I read a few other tutorials and subsequently downloaded and installed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/">XAMPP</a>, making sure to include Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin in the installation. I opened up XAMPP and pressed the “Start Application” button. That took me to an error page.</p><p>I clicked through some XAMPP tabs and pressed a few more buttons that started Apache, MySQL, and ProFTD. Now pressing “Start Application” took me to an XAMPP page. This seemed promising, but I still got an error page when trying to access my WordPress site which should have been running locally.</p><p>I bopped around a bit more and figured out that I had to enable local forwarding in XAMPP on an available port. I roll my eyes and question why XAMPP is so difficult to use.</p><p>Now that I could <em>see</em> my WordPress site locally, I still couldn’t do anything (e.g. create post). I learned that I needed to create a database locally via phpMyAdmin. Again, this is something that should have been easy, but the interface SUCKED. I had such difficulty performing such a simple action. I mean…just look at it:&nbsp;</p><figure><img width="1024" height="544" src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png" alt="phpMyAdmin home screen" srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-300x159.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-768x408.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1536x817.png 1536w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-2048x1089.png 2048w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-600x319.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png" data-srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-300x159.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-768x408.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1536x817.png 1536w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-2048x1089.png 2048w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-600x319.png 600w"><figcaption><em>phpMyAdmin home screen</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img width="1022" height="486" src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png" alt="bad database creation UI" srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png 1022w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-300x143.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-768x365.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-600x285.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png" data-srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png 1022w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-300x143.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-768x365.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-600x285.png 600w"><figcaption><em>phpMyAdmin “Create Database” page</em></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at these screenshots now makes me annoyed all over again.</p><h2 id="annoying-issues"><strong>More annoying issues I faced</strong></h2><p>I then ran into some issues that took me a long time to figure out. Surprisingly, there was not a lot of advice out there on good solutions. I spent more time than I’d like to admit on WordPress support forums and arcane blogs. I’ll include the two most annoying issues here for posterity and in the event that another poor soul is also sifting through Google searching for a solution.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Annoying error #1: “to perform the requested action WordPress needs to access your web server”</em></strong></p><p>To fix this, add <code>define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' );</code> to your <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</p><p><strong><em>Annoying error #2: fix the file and folder permissions error in WordPress / “installation failed could not create directory”</em></strong></p><p>To fix this, you need to give XAMPP write access to the local directory you have WordPress set up in. I spent awhile messing around with quite a few config files (like .htaccess) and FTP permission codes to no avail. The solution was ultimately simple: right-click on your local WordPress directory, click “Get Info”, scroll to “Sharing &amp; Permissions”, and change the permissions on your directory to “Read and Write (anyone)”.</p><h2 id="is-it-working"><strong>Finally, it’s working?</strong></h2><p>At long last, all of this is finally working and I now have WordPress running locally.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, the next step is to install a plugin to convert my site into a bunch of static pages. I go with <a href="https://www.simplystatic.co/">SimplyStatic</a>, the most popular and highly recommended plugin to do this.</p><p>I immediately run into quite a few errors with SimplyStatic. After progressively resolving each one, I ultimately run into one I can’t fix. I search some more and realize that it’s because SimplyStatic was only compatible with an earlier version of WordPress than the one I was running. I dig further and realize that the plugin hasn’t been updated for over two years. And there don’t seem to be <em>any</em> currently updated plugins that do this conversion. Epic FAIL.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn’t want to sink in even more time to learn how to convert the WordPress PHP files into static pages. I decided to cut my losses right there and abandon ship.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="conclusion"><strong>The Conclusion</strong></h2><p><strong><span>TL;DR? Don’t try to run WordPress locally, and don’t try to use WordPress with Github Pages to host and serve it. It won’t work.</span></strong></p><p>I ultimately ended up going with <a href="http://siteground.com/">Siteground</a> for managed hosting. Siteground’s interface is awful, but after poking around a bit I got most of it set up. I had a few minor configuration issues when enabling HTTPS and spent ~30 minutes chatting with a customer support agent, who was actually quite helpful.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="postscript"><strong>Postscript: I’m never satisfied and here are a few more things about WordPress that I’m annoyed with</strong></h2><ol><li>Unless you want your WordPress site to look bad or just like everyone else’s, you’ll probably want to customize an existing theme to your own liking. <strong>To do this, you’ll still need to hack around with code<em> </em></strong><em>(in this case, a combination of HTML, CSS and PHP)</em>. Theoretically, you could probably install a plugin to help you do this, but that’d probably slow down your site and further obscure how things actually work.&nbsp;</li><li>Getting used to WordPress itself was a bit of a curve. The main dashboard, for instance, is completely useless to me. I’ve just been ignoring all parts of the interface I don’t need, which thus far has been working pretty well.&nbsp;</li></ol><hr><p>If you liked this post, add your email address below to stay updated whenever there’s a new one.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most WebAssembly tutorials and examples you will find online focus on using it inside the browser in order to accelerate various functionality of a website or web app.<br>
However, there is an area where WebAssembly is really powerful but not talked too much about: outside the browser usage scenarios. That is what we’ll focus on in this series of posts.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-webassembly">What is WebAssembly?</h2>
<p>Web people are on a roll of giving bad names to things (web-gpu is another example).<br>
WebAssembly is neither web or assembly, but a bytecode that can be targeted from languages like C++, C#, Rust and others. This means you can write some Rust code, compile it into WebAssembly and run that code in a WebAssembly virtual machine.</p>

<p>This is powerful because you won’t have to deal with garbage collected scripted languages anymore, and essentially use Rust or C++ as your <em>scripting language</em>.  WebAssembly enables predictable and stable performance because it doesn’t require garbage collection like the usual options (LUA/JavaScript).</p>

<p>It’s a relatively new product and there are a lot of rough edges, especially for out-of-browser scenarios. One of the roughest ones in my experience has been documentation for out-of-browser scenarios and this is the reason for my blog posts, to document my findings and hopefully help some people that may be interested in this subject.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-we-want-to-run-webassembly-outside-of-a-browser">Why would we want to run WebAssembly outside of a browser?</h2>
<p>For out of browser scenarios, one of its main advantage is that it provides system level access without compromising on security. This is done through WASI, the Web Assembly System Interface. <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> is a collection of C-like functions that provide access to functionality such as <code>fd_read</code>, <code>rand</code>, <code>fd_write</code>, threads (WIP), in a safe way.</p>

<p>Here are a few scenarios where you would be able to use web-assembly outside of a browser:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A scripting language for a video game.</li>
  <li>To run some code with minimal overhead as Fastly/Cloudflare are doing with their compute-at-edge scenarios.</li>
  <li>To run some easy to update code on IoT devices safely and with minimal runtime overhead.</li>
  <li>Extreamly fast programs in environments where you can’t JIT for <em>reasons</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>For the best experience in this adventure, I suggest using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as your IDE and install the following extensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>rust-analyzer</code>: for autocomplete and other great features.</li>
  <li><code>Code-LLDB</code>: For debugging with LLDB (even works on Windows)</li>
  <li><code>WebAssembly by the WebAssembly foundation</code>: Allows you to disassemble and inspect <code>.wasm</code> binaries.</li>
</ul>


<p>First you need a Virtual Machine (VM) that can run your WebAssembly program. This VM needs to be embeddable, so you can add it in your game engine, or what we will call from now on <strong>host program</strong>. There are a few to pick from: <a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3">WASM3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">WAMR</a>, and many others. They have various characteristics, such as supporting JIT, using as little memory as possible and so on and you have to choose one one that fits your target platform and scenario.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter too much what VM you’re choosing besides runtime properties, with the exception of debugging. The only VM that allows for a seamless debugging experience that I’ve found is Wasmtime (this is another one of those rough edges). So even if you don’t plan on deploying that anywhere due to other constraints, I suggest using it as the <strong>debug VM</strong>. Whenever you’d want to debug some WASM code you can launch it with Wasmtime.</p>



<p>First, we need to create a new <code>lib</code> project:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>cargo new <span>--lib</span> wasm_example
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In <code>Cargo.toml</code> add the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can edit <code>lib.rs</code> and export the following <code>C</code> FFI compatible function from it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[no_mangle]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"From WASM: Sum is: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
    <span>s</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This a function that takes two numbers, adds them, then prints the result before returning their sum.<br>
WebAssembly doesn’t define a default function that’s executed after a module is loaded, so in the host program you need to get a function by it’s signature, and run it (quite similar to how <code>dlopen</code>/<code>dlsym</code> works).</p>

<p>We expose this <code>sum</code> function (and any other functions we want to call from the host VM) as a function that’s callable from <code>C</code>, using <code>[#no_mangle]</code> and <code>pub extern "C"</code>. If you’re coming here from some WASM for the browser tutorials, you may notice we don’t need to use <code>wasm-bindgen</code> at all.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-compile-it">How do we compile it?</h2>
<p>Rust supports two targets for WebAssembly: <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> and <code>wasm32-wasi</code>. The first one is bare-bones WebAssembly. Think of it like the <code>[#no-std]</code> of WebAssembly. It’s the kind you’d use for the browser that doesn’t assume any system functions are available.</p>

<p>At the other end, <code>wasm32-wasi</code> assumes that the VM exposes the <code>WASI</code> functionality, allowing a different implementation of the standard library to be used (the implementation that depends on the WASI functions to be available).</p>

<p>You can take a look at the available implementations for the Rust’s stdlib here: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys</a>  <br>
This is the implementation that assumes WASI functions are available to the rust program when running in a WebAssembly VM: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys/wasi">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys/wasi</a>.</p>

<p>To comile for wasm32-wasi run:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Run this just once</span>
rustup target add wasm32-wasi

<span># Compile for the wasm32-wasi target.</span>
cargo build <span>--target</span> wasm32-wasi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="but-how-does-println-work">But how does <code>println!()</code> work?</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that we’re calling <code>println!()</code> and expecting the program to work and print to the console, but how does a WebAssembly program knows how to do that?</p>

<p>This is why we’re using <code>wasm32-wasi</code>. This target selects for the rust stdlib the version that assumes some functionality to be there (the <code>WASI</code> functions). Printing to the console means just writing to a special file descriptor. Most VMs allow that by default so we don’t need to do any special settings, besides compiling the correct <code>wasm32-wasi</code> target.</p>

<p>If you have installed the required extensions for vscode, you can now right click on <code>target/wasm32-wasi/debug/wasm_example.wasm</code> and select <code>Show WebAssembly</code> and you should have a new file open in vscode that looks like this:</p>

<p>This is a <code>wat</code> file. <code>wat</code> stands for WebAssembly text format. It’s kind of like looking at x64/ARM ASM instructions when disassembling a binary, just uglier and harder to understand. I have read that this was because the creators of WebAssembly couldn’t decide on a text format so they just left it in this ugly s-expression form.</p>

<p>The import statements here tell us that the WASM program needs the following functions <code>proc_exit</code>, <code>fd_write</code>, <code>environ_get</code>, <code>environ_sizes_get</code> to exist in the <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> namespace.<br>
All imported or exported functions from a WebAssembly module require a namespace. <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> is the WASI namespace so you can think of it as a reserved namespace for these functions. <code>println!</code> needs <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1::fd_write</code> to write to stdout.</p>

<h2 id="the-host-program">The host program</h2>
<p>You can pick any VM that has WASI available. I will use Wasmtime because later on I want to show you how to debug WebAssembly and this VM is the only one where debugging works at the moment.</p>

<p>The program loads the wasm binary file from the path: <code>examples/wasm_example.wasm</code>.<br>
This is the file you have previously compiled that you can find in <code>wasm_example/target/wasm32-wasi/debug/wasm_example.wasm</code>. <strong>Make sure you move it in the right place before running the host program.</strong></p>

<p>Here is the full listing of the host VM rust program that initializes the Wasmtime VM, loads the module, links against WASI and loads and executes the exported <code>sum</code> function from the WASM module:</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>This paper is an attempt to explain all the matrix calculus you need in order to understand the training of deep neural networks. We assume no math knowledge beyond what you learned in calculus 1, and provide links to help you refresh the necessary math where needed. Note that you do <b>not</b> need to understand this material before you start learning to train and use deep learning in practice; rather, this material is for those who are already familiar with the basics of neural networks, and wish to deepen their understanding of the underlying math. Don't worry if you get stuck at some point along the way---just go back and reread the previous section, and try writing down and working through some examples. And if you're still stuck, we're happy to answer your questions in the <a href="http://forums.fast.ai/c/theory">Theory category at forums.fast.ai</a>. <b>Note</b>: There is a <a href="#reference">reference section</a> at the end of the paper summarizing all the key matrix calculus rules and terminology discussed here.</p>






<h2 id="intro">Introduction </h2>


<p>Most of us last saw calculus in school, but derivatives are a critical part of machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, which are trained by optimizing a loss function. Pick up a machine learning paper or the documentation of a library such as <a href="http://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> and calculus comes screeching back into your life like distant relatives around the holidays.  And it's not just any old scalar calculus that pops up---you need differential <i>matrix calculus</i>, the shotgun wedding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">linear algebra</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus">multivariate calculus</a>. </p>

<p>Well... maybe <i>need</i> isn't the right word; Jeremy's courses show how to become a world-class deep learning practitioner with only a minimal level of scalar calculus, thanks to leveraging the automatic differentiation built in to modern deep learning libraries. But if you really want to really understand what's going on under the hood of these libraries, and grok academic papers discussing the latest advances in model training techniques, you'll need to understand certain bits of the field of matrix calculus.</p>

<p>For example, the activation of a single computation unit in a neural network is typically calculated using the dot product (from linear algebra) of an edge weight vector <span>w</span> with an input vector <span>x</span> plus a scalar bias (threshold): <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-EEDCFA4252D0992243A283CE0EB777A6-depth003.31.svg">. Function <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-C599D931407509E0FA08F8686B205B6D-depth003.25.svg"> is called the unit's <i>affine function</i> and is followed by a <a href="https://goo.gl/7BXceK">rectified linear unit</a>, which clips negative values to zero: <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-66258AA93A4746DA10D306190271DE4B-depth003.25.svg">. Such a computational unit is sometimes referred to as an “artificial neuron” and looks like:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/neuron.png" alt="neuron.png" width="250"></p>
</center>

<p>Neural networks consist of many of these units, organized into multiple collections of neurons called <i>layers</i>. The activation of one layer's units become the input to the next layer's units. The activation of the unit or units in the final layer is called the network output.</p>

<p><i>Training</i> this neuron means choosing weights <span>w</span> and bias <span>b</span> so that we get the desired output for all <span>N</span> inputs <span>x</span>.  To do that, we minimize a <i>loss function</i> that compares the network's final <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-7971D42A6C6C6A28D6443F0645E4A036-depth003.25.svg"> with the <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-E146B831A1E53B95E4C63775285D62CF-depth003.25.svg"> (desired output of <span>x</span>) for all input <span>x</span> vectors. To minimize the loss, we use some variation on gradient descent, such as plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">stochastic gradient descent</a> (SGD), SGD with momentum, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Adam">Adam</a>.   All of those require the partial derivative (the gradient) of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-7971D42A6C6C6A28D6443F0645E4A036-depth003.25.svg"> with respect to the model parameters <span>w</span> and <span>b</span>. Our goal is to gradually tweak <span>w</span> and <span>b</span> so that the overall loss function keeps getting smaller across all <span>x</span> inputs.</p>

<p>If we're careful, we can derive the gradient by differentiating the scalar version of a common loss function (mean squared error):</p>
<p><img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/blkeqn-A129949CD1EF7BE2CA8BD424D34F9930.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>But this is just one neuron, and neural networks must train the weights and biases of all neurons in all layers simultaneously.  Because there are multiple inputs and (potentially) multiple network outputs, we really need general rules for the derivative of a function with respect to a vector and even rules for the derivative of a vector-valued function with respect to a vector.</p>

<p>This article walks through the derivation of some important rules for computing partial derivatives with respect to vectors, particularly those useful for training neural networks. This field is known as <i>matrix calculus</i>, and the good news is, we only need a small subset of that field, which we introduce here.  While there is a lot of online material on multivariate calculus and linear algebra, they are typically taught as two separate undergraduate courses so most material treats them in isolation.  The pages that do discuss matrix calculus often are really just lists of rules with minimal explanation or are just pieces of the story. They also tend to be quite obscure to all but a narrow audience of mathematicians, thanks to their use of dense notation and minimal discussion of foundational concepts. (See the annotated list of resources at the end.)</p>

<p>In contrast, we're going to rederive and rediscover some key matrix calculus rules in an effort to explain them. It turns out that matrix calculus is really not that hard! There aren't dozens of new rules to learn; just a couple of key concepts.  Our hope is that this short paper will get you started quickly in the world of matrix calculus as it relates to training neural networks. We're assuming you're already familiar with the basics of neural network architecture and training. If you're not, head over to <a href="http://course.fast.ai/">Jeremy's course</a> and complete part 1 of that, then we'll see you back here when you're done. (Note that, unlike many more academic approaches, we strongly suggest <i>first</i> learning to train and use neural networks in practice and <i>then</i> study the underlying math. The math will be much more understandable with the context in place; besides, it's not necessary to grok all this calculus to become an effective practitioner.)</p>

<p><i>A note on notation</i>: Jeremy's course exclusively uses code, instead of math notation, to explain concepts since unfamiliar functions in code are easy to search for and experiment with. In this paper, we do the opposite: there is a lot of math notation because one of the goals of this paper is to help you understand the notation that you'll see in deep learning papers and books. At the <a href="#notation">end of the paper</a>, you'll find a brief table of the notation used, including a word or phrase you can use to search for more details.</p>

<p>There are other rules for trigonometry, exponentials, etc., which you can find at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus">Khan Academy differential calculus course</a>.</p>

<p>When a function has a single parameter, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-50BBD36E1FD2333108437A2CA378BE62-depth003.25.svg">, you'll often see <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-6BDA8AF54C40BC23ED858E9E9F5C11D2-depth002.72.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-74CAF4D1EC90D3A36EA7C7BBFE65B516-depth003.25.svg"> used as shorthands for <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-5BA9D16419154B1BDBECA39D99E8E809-depth004.58.svg">. We recommend against this notation as it does not make clear the variable we're taking the derivative with respect to. </p>

<p>You can think of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg"> as an operator that maps a function of one parameter to another function.  That means that <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-EC0CEC5F9488EC510F8D688E7003222D-depth004.58.svg"> maps <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-50BBD36E1FD2333108437A2CA378BE62-depth003.25.svg"> to its derivative with respect to <span>x</span>, which is the same thing as <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-07A5EA519C4CEA1A3539E3A7FC289163-depth004.58.svg">. Also, if <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-FD91C508F91C2C84498680BD337C1D7A-depth003.25.svg">, then <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-B1ED3CF9BA4D6F25A5A4F481C45EC658-depth004.58.svg">. Thinking of the derivative as an operator helps to simplify complicated derivatives because the operator is distributive and lets us pull out constants. For example, in the following equation, we can pull out the constant 9 and distribute the derivative operator across the elements within the parentheses.</p>
<p><img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/blkeqn-A1EC7F214318E08949CC8BFCED138D94.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>That procedure reduced the derivative of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-FDFD125C741CD062B2CA779DDE0524BE-depth003.25.svg"> to a bit of arithmetic and the derivatives of <span>x</span> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-32F5240D0DBF2CCBE75EF7F8EF2015E0-depth000.14.svg">, which are much easier to solve than the original derivative.</p>


<h2 id="sec3">Introduction to vector calculus and partial derivatives</h2>


<p>Neural network layers are not single functions of a single parameter, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-50BBD36E1FD2333108437A2CA378BE62-depth003.25.svg">. So, let's move on to functions of multiple parameters such as <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-3BAF1600AE50930A155F58AE172B51BD-depth003.25.svg">. For example, what is the derivative of <span>xy</span> (i.e., the multiplication of <span>x</span> and <span>y</span>)? In other words, how does the product <span>xy</span> change when we wiggle the variables? Well, it depends on whether we are changing <span>x</span> or <span>y</span>.  We compute derivatives with respect to one variable (parameter) at a time, giving us two different <i>partial derivatives</i> for this two-parameter function (one for <span>x</span> and one for <span>y</span>).  Instead of using operator <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg">, the partial derivative operator is  <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-4D6C379F66675645B3FFE28A15306857-depth004.67.svg"> (a stylized <span>d</span> and not the Greek letter <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-77A3B715842B45E440A5BEE15357AD29-depth000.22.svg">). So, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-08DCCFBE629A14FCCD9FB9A20F2E367C-depth004.67.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-1FDCF7A9F137AE48FA25EE34A69F8201-depth006.34.svg"> are the partial derivatives of <span>xy</span>; often, these are just called the <i>partials</i>.  For functions of a single parameter, operator <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-4D6C379F66675645B3FFE28A15306857-depth004.67.svg"> is equivalent to <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg"> (for sufficiently smooth functions). However, it's better to use <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg"> to make it clear you're referring to a scalar derivative.</p>

<p>The partial derivative with respect to <span>x</span> is just the usual scalar derivative, simply treating any other variable in the equation as a constant.  Consider function <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-D6DEAE7E403381C2C425D4B40CCA936E-depth003.25.svg">. The partial derivative with respect to <span>x</span> is written <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-F063B8EC812DF3D204F9327F5D094073-depth004.67.svg">. There are three constants from the perspective of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-4D6C379F66675645B3FFE28A15306857-depth004.67.svg">: 3, 2, and <span>y</span>. Therefore, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-D981BA4BD14AC44C43A4E4E0EC750B4A-depth004.67.svg">. The partial derivative with respect to <span>y</span> treats <span>x</span> like a constant: <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-55A3A400FAD3326FEF1BB9DDD2658383-depth006.34.svg">.  It's a good idea to derive these yourself before continuing otherwise the rest of the article won't make sense.  Here's the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/partial-derivative-and-gradient-articles/a/introduction-to-partial-derivatives">Khan Academy video on partials</a> if you need help.</p>

<p>To make it clear we are doing vector calculus and not just multivariate calculus, let's consider what we do with the partial derivatives <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-84D799755A7F73945BD58B2E057121AB-depth004.67.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-A2DE2EC029172B84A0A0E8A8D00F5A6F-depth006.34.svg"> (another way to say <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-75645E70B6C95F7466C353E9C2306FE0-depth004.67.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-B20FF70C037320C2D0B710F4B592927E-depth006.34.svg">) that we computed for <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-D6DEAE7E403381C2C425D4B40CCA936E-depth003.25.svg">.  Instead of having them just floating around and not organized in any way, let's organize them into a horizontal vector. We call this vector the <i>gradient</i> of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-3BAF1600AE50930A155F58AE172B51BD-depth003.25.svg"> and …</p></div>

		<p><em>If you enjoy this article, please check out my free book by clicking <a href="https://deponysum.com/2020/03/30/something-to-read-in-quarantine-essays-2018-to-2020/">Here: “Something to Read in Quarantine: Essays 2018-2020.”</a></em></p>
<p id="b9a9">Natural Language Processing (NLP) per Wikipedia:</p>
<p id="34cf">“Is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.”</p>
<p id="7dd8">The field has seen tremendous advances during the recent explosion of progress in machine learning techniques.</p>
<p id="b5f8">Here are some of its more impressive recent achievements:</p>
<p id="cb15"><strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;The Winograd Schema is a test of common sense reasoning- easy for humans, but historically almost impossible for computers- which requires the test taker to indicate which noun an ambiguous pronoun stands for. The correct answer hinges on a single word, which is different between two separate versions of the question. For example:</p>
<p id="512d"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.</em></p>
<p id="ece3"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.</em></p>
<p id="0ddf">Who does the pronoun “They” refer to in each of the instances?</p>
<p id="d33c">The Winograd schema test was originally intended to be a more rigorous replacement for the Turing test, because it seems to require deep knowledge of how things fit together in the world, and the ability to reason about that knowledge in a linguistic context. Recent advances in NLP have allowed computers to achieve near human scores:(<a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/</a>).</p>
<p id="0a43"><strong>B)</strong>&nbsp;The New York Regent’s science exam is a test requiring both scientific knowledge and reasoning skills, covering an extremely broad range of topics. Some of the questions include:</p>
<p id="a36d"><em>1.Which equipment will best separate a mixture of iron filings and black pepper? (1) magnet (2) filter paper (3) triplebeam balance (4) voltmeter</em></p>
<p id="9797"><em>2. Which form of energy is produced when a rubber band vibrates? (1) chemical (2) light (3) electrical (4) sound</em></p>
<p id="966a"><em>3. Because copper is a metal, it is (1) liquid at room temperature (2) nonreactive with other substances (3) a poor conductor of electricity (4) a good conductor of heat</em></p>
<p id="6d70"><em>4. Which process in an apple tree primarily results from cell division? (1) growth (2) photosynthesis (3) gas exchange (4) waste removal</em></p>
<p id="3a8a">On the 8th grade, non-diagram based questions of the test, a program was recently able to score 90%. (&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p id="2f49"><strong>C)</strong></p>
<p id="267a">It’s not just about answer selection either. Progress in text generation has been impressive. See, for example, some of the text samples created by Megatron:&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf</a></p>
<p id="b8f7"><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p id="db13">Much of this progress has been rapid. Big progress on the Winograd schema, for example, still looked like it might be decades away back in (from memory) much of 2018. The computer science is advancing very fast, but it’s not clear our concepts have kept up.</p>
<p id="1a6c">I found this relatively sudden progress in NLP surprising. In my head- and maybe this was naive- I had thought that, in order to attempt these sorts of tasks with any facility, it wouldn’t be sufficient to simply feed a computer lots of text. Instead, any “proper” attempt to understand language would have to integrate different modalities of experience and understanding, like visual and auditory, in order to build up a full picture of how things relate to each other in the world. Only on the basis of this extra-linguistic grounding could it deal flexibly with problems involving rich meanings- we might call this the multi-modality thesis. Whether the multi-modality thesis is true for some kinds of problems or not, it’s certainly true for far fewer problems than I, and many others, had suspected.</p>
<p id="5a4d">I think science-fictiony speculations generally backed me up on this (false) hunch. Most people imagined that this kind of high-level language “understanding” would be the capstone of AI research, the thing that comes after the program already has a sophisticated extra-linguistic model of the world. This sort of just seemed obvious- a great example of how assumptions you didn’t even know you were making can ruin attempts to predict the future.</p>
<p id="f943">In hindsight it makes a certain sense that reams and reams of text alone can be used to build the capabilities needed to answer questions like these. A lot of people remind us that these programs are really just statistical analyses of the co-occurence of words, however complex and glorified. However we should not forget that the relationships between words are isomorphic to the relations between things- that isomorphism is why language works. This is to say the patterns in language use mirror the patterns of how things are(1). Models are transitive- if x models y, and y models z, then x models z. The upshot of these facts are that if you have a really good statistical model of how words relate to each other, that model is also implicitly a model of the world.</p>
<p id="12db">It might be instructive to think about what it would take to create a program which has a model of eighth grade science sufficient to understand and answer questions about hundreds of different things like “growth is driven by cell division”, and “What can magnets be used for” that wasn’t NLP led. It would be a nightmare of many different (probably handcrafted) models. Speaking somewhat loosely, language allows for intellectual capacities to be greatly compressed. From this point of view, it shouldn’t be surprising that some of the first signs of really broad capacity- common sense reasoning, wide ranging problem solving etc., have been found in language based programs- words and their relationships are just a vastly more efficient way of representing knowledge than the alternatives.</p>
<p id="1e8b">So I find myself wondering if language is not the crown of general intelligence, but a potential shortcut to it.</p>
<p id="beea"><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p id="0095">A couple of weeks ago I finished this essay, read through it, and decided it was not good enough to publish. The point about language being isomorphic to the world, and that therefore any sufficiently good model of language&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a model of the world, is important, but it’s kind of abstract, and far from original.</p>
<p id="e0e2">Then today I read&nbsp;<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this report</a>&nbsp;by Scott Alexander of having trained GPT-2 (a language program) to play chess. I realised this was the perfect example. GPT-2 has no (visual) understanding of things like the arrangement of a chess board. But if you feed it enough sequences of alphanumerically encoded games- 1.Kt-f3, d5 and so on- it begins to understand patterns in these strings of characters which are isomorphic to chess itself. Thus, for all intents and purposes, it develops a model of chess.</p>
<p id="1a14">Exactly how strong this approach is- whether GPT-2 is capable of some limited analysis, or can only overfit openings- remains to be seen. We might have a better idea as it is optimised — for example, once it is fed board states instead of sequences of moves. Either way though, it illustrates the point about isomorphism.</p>
<p id="a87a">Of course everyday language stands in a woolier relation to sheep, pine cones, desire and quarks than the formal language of chess moves stands in relation to chess moves, and the patterns are far more complex. Modality, uncertainty, vagueness and other complexities enter but the isomorphism between world and language is there, even if inexact.</p>
<p id="b6c0"><strong>Postscript- The Chinese Room Argument</strong></p>
<p id="f901">After similar arguments are made, someone usually mentions the Chinese room thought experiment. There are, I think, two useful things to say about it:</p>
<p id="3d7e">A) The thought experiment is an argument about understanding in itself, separate from capacity to handle tasks, a difficult thing to quantify or understand. It’s unclear that there is a practical upshot for what <em>AI can actually do.</em></p>
<p id="1f79">B) A lot of the power of the thought experiment hinges on the fact that the room solves questions using a lookup table, this stacks the deck. Perhaps we be more willing to say that the room as a whole understood language if it formed an (implicit) model of how things are, and of the current context, and used those models to answer questions? Even if this doesn’t deal with all the intuition that the room cannot understand Chinese, I think it takes a bite from it.</p>
<p id="96a9">— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —</p>
<p id="4642">(1)- Strictly of course only the patterns in true sentences mirror, or are isomorphic to, the arrangement of the world, but most sentences people utter are at least approximately true.</p>

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the globe, lots of people are stuck
at home, either working remotely or sitting around without much to do. The
previous afternoon, I had stumbled across an online announcement that the
<a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/march/dl-access-during-covid-19">ACM Digital Library has been made free to all to read and download</a> to
help foster research, discovery, and learning during this time of crisis.
Feeling curious, and having previously wanted to read certain research papers
from the ACM DL previously, I took the opportunity to peruse through its library
and read as much content as I could. As I was doing so, I stumbled across a very
useful paper called <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3167132.3167261"><strong>"Syntax error recovery in parsing expression
grammars"</strong></a> by (Medeiros, S. and Fabio Mascarenhas, 2018) that I would
like to share, and I'll be testing some of its concepts using a prototype parser
written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> with the help of the <a href="https://docs.rs/nom"><code>nom</code></a> crate.</p>
<h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2>
<p>Language parsing is a very broad and interesting topic, with a swathe of varying
approaches and tools to choose from depending on the requirements of the task at
hand, but the basic premise is simple: the goal of a parser is to consume some
data as input, break it down into its component parts according to some grammar,
and derive meaning or understanding from it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">wiki</a>). I personally happen to
enjoy working with <em>parsing expression grammars</em> (PEGs) and <em>parser combinators</em>
when writing my own projects.</p>
<p>In case you are not familiar, PEG is a kind of declarative formal language for
describing other languages in terms of string pattern matching. That is, PEG
allows the parser author to declare the grammar of the language they wish to
parse using sets of expressions like those shown below:</p>
<pre><span>expr    ← sum
sum     ← product (('+' / '-') product)*
product ← value (('*' / '/') value)*
value   ← [0-9]+ / '(' expr ')'
</span></pre>
<p>These PEG rules would then be able to describe the rules to a simple arithmetic
language that behaves like this:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Input</th><th>Parsed syntax tree</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>123</code></td><td><code>Value(123)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>1 + 2</code></td><td><code>Sum(Value(1), Value(2))</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>1 + 2 * 3</code></td><td><code>Sum(Value(1), Product(Value(2), Value(3)))</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>(1 + 2) * 3</code></td><td><code>Product(Sum(Value(1), Value(2)), Value(3))</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Any PEG expression can be converted directly into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent parser</a>,
either automatically using a parser generator or crafted by hand in the
programming language of your choice.</p>
<p>I really enjoy using parser combinator frameworks like <a href="https://docs.rs/nom"><code>nom</code></a> as a nice middle
ground between the two options, since they grant you the freedom and flexibility
of writing your parser fully in the host language (in this example, Rust), but
the resulting code is succinct, fairly declarative, and looks somewhat PEG-ish,
if you tilt your head and squint hard enough.</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>expr</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt; {

<p>Each of the four parsers above corresponds to a PEG rule, and since each one is
represented as a pure function, they compose nicely in code and each one can
easily be tested in isolation from the others, e.g. with inline unit tests. All
in all, I enjoy working with PEG and parser combinators!</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I've been hacking on a parser and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a> for the <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix programming
language</a> as a side project (<a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/nix-language-server">GitHub</a>) for some time now, and this extended
period of being stuck at home renewed my interest in working on it. This
language server aims to supply code analysis, and auto-completion for compatible
third-party text editors and IDEs. This project has been very challenging for me
to work on, in a good way, because language servers tend to have very strict
requirements of their underlying parsers.</p>
<p>Most compilers and static analysis tools are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_program">batch programs</a> which act like a
dumb pipe, consuming source code in one end and spitting an executable out the
other (yes, incremental compilation and artifact caching bends this analogy a
bit, but the basic premise still holds). This means that their parsers and
resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">abstract syntax trees</a> are optimized for very different things than
what an interactive IDE would want.</p>
<p>Since the user is continuously modifying the source text and entering keystrokes
into their editor, the parser providing syntax checking for their editor is very
frequently exposed to incomplete or downright invalid snippets of code more
often than not. This means that halting parsing and bailing with an error
message whenever the first error is encountered, like many traditional parsers
do, is <em>simply not an option</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/76758522-1ee9ad80-678a-11ea-84cd-111739ecd379.gif" alt="rust-analyzer in action">
<em>Source: <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/thisweek/2020/03/16/changelog-16.html">rust-analyzer Changelog #16</a></em></p>
<p>Instead, the parser needs to be as fault-tolerant as possible, always producing
a syntax tree of some kind on every single parse and deriving as much syntactic
and semantic meaning as it can from user input, however malformed it might be.
Your editor should still be able to provide meaningful code completion, hover
documentation, go-to-definition, and symbol searching regardless of whether
there is a missing semicolon somewhere halfway down the page.</p>
<h2 id="a-naive-approach">A naive approach</h2>
<p>When I first started working on this project, I had chosen to implement my Nix
parser in Rust using <code>nom</code> 5.0, since that was the tool I was most comfortable
using for writing parsers at the time.</p>
<p>As I was writing up my parsers, I very quickly realized that bailing early from
parsing with an <code>Err(nom::Err::Error(_))</code> or <code>Err(nom::Error::Failure(_))</code>
wasn't a good idea for emitting errors. The former triggers a backtrack, which I
didn't always want, and the latter would halt parsing altogether with an error,
which I never wanted. <code>Err(nom::Error::Incomplete(_))</code> sounded promising due to
the name, but it too ended up being useless given the design constraints I had
in mind. I needed some way to log that a non-fatal parse error had been
encountered and resume parsing as though nothing had happened, but
unfortunately, there seemed to be nothing in the vast <code>nom</code> parser combinator
toolbox that could help me deal with this.</p>
<p>Given that <code>nom</code> parser combinators are pure functions whose signatures are
structured like this:</p>
<pre><span>impl </span><span>Fn(Input) -&gt; IResult&lt;Input, Output, Error&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>which maps to:</p>
<pre><span>impl </span><span>Fn(Input) -&gt; Result&lt;(Remaining, Output), Error&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>I decided to carry these non-fatal parse errors through the <code>Output</code> instead of
returning them through <code>Result::Err(nom::Error::Error(_))</code> using a custom data
structure which I had named <a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/nix-language-server/blob/master/nix-parser/src/parser/partial.rs#L64-L68"><code>Partial</code></a>. This was a monadic data structure which
was essentially:</p>
<pre><span>pub struct </span><span>Partial&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>value</span><span>: Option&lt;T&gt;,
    </span><span>errors</span><span>: Vec&lt;Error&gt;,
}

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T&gt; Partial&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>map</span><span>&lt;U, F&gt;(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>f</span><span>: F) -&gt; Partial&lt;U&gt;
    </span><span>where</span><span>
        F: FnOnce(T) -&gt; U
    { ... }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>flat_map</span><span>&lt;U, F&gt;(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>f</span><span>: F) -&gt; Partial&lt;U&gt;
    </span><span>where</span><span>
        F: FnOnce(T) -&gt; Partial&lt;U&gt;
    { ... }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>value</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt; {
        ...
    }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>errors</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; &amp;[Error] {
        ...
    }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;T, Vec&lt;Error&gt;&gt; {
        ...
    }
}
</span></pre>
<p>This data structure was complemented with a bunch of custom <code>nom</code> combinators,
e.g. <code>map_partial()</code>, <code>expect_terminated()</code>, and <code>skip_if_err()</code>, which would
allow me to compose these fault-tolerant parsers together while accumulating
errors in the <code>errors</code> field.</p>
<p>The consumer of this data structure would then choose to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assert that they need a valid AST without errors by calling <code>expr.verify()</code>,
transforming the <code>Partial&lt;T&gt;</code> into a <code>Result&lt;T, Vec&lt;Error&gt;&gt;</code>. This option
would be useful for traditonal batch compiler authors, as well as for testing
and debugging.</li>
<li>Extract and examine the contents of the <code>value</code> and <code>errors</code> field
separately. This is what the language server would do: publish the
accumulated errors to the user's editor in the form of diagnostics and then
perform further analysis on the syntax tree contained in <code>value</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the parser combinators would have this function signature instead:</p>
<pre><span>impl </span><span>Fn(Input) -&gt; IResult&lt;Input, Partial&lt;Output&gt;, Error&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>While this approach seemed to work well initially, it spiralled out of control
once the parser grew beyond a certain size. The number of <code>Partial</code> specific
combinators grew, the parser logic got hairier, more imperative, and trickier to
debug, and the performance implications of carrying around a heavy stack of
errors from function to function <a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/nix-language-server/commit/4cd939a2917709a527bd1967f4a29bfd9f2767cc">were astonishingly awful</a>. It didn't
look and feel that much like PEG anymore.</p>
<p>I will admit I learned a lot about a breadth of topics during this time, from
benchmarking functions with <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs"><code>criterion</code></a> to generating flamegraphs with
<a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/flamegraph"><code>cargo-flamegraph</code></a>, and going to extreme lengths to avoid heap allocations to
make the parser as fast as possible. I used <a href="https://docs.rs/nom_locate"><code>nom_locate</code></a> to retain string span
information and be as zero-copy as possible when constructing the syntax tree.
But ultimately, I couldn't fix all the warts and fundamental flaws. I needed a
new approach.</p>
<h2 id="the-paper-s-solution">The paper's solution</h2>
<p>Finally, back to the paper that originally inspired this article! I shelved this
project some months ago due to work and personal life matters, but came back
to it last month with some fresh ideas and a better intuition of where to look.
Discouraged by the previous setbacks, I was questioning whether parser
combinators in general were flexible enough to express parsers which were both
permissive and fault-tolerant, while also emitting good hand-crafted
diagnostics. But then I stumbled upon the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3167132.3167261">"Syntax error recovery in parsing
expression grammars" (2018)</a> paper while scouring the ACM DL search
engine for interesting articles last night.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper actually managed to get pretty great results parsing
the <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua programming language</a> using a set of extended PEGs, producing excellent
tailor-made diagnostics rivaling the automatic error recovering capabilities of
their control, a top-down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser">LL parser</a>…</p></article></section></div>

<p>This is a quick writeup of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganographic</a> tool
that I threw together: <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/steg86"><em>steg86</em></a>. It uses a quirk of the
x86 instruction encoding format to hide messages in pre-existing binaries with no size or
performance overhead.</p>

<p>You can play with it yourself by fetching it with <code>cargo</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>cargo <span>install </span>steg86
<span>$ </span>steg86 <span>--help</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="a-quick-steganography-refresher">A quick steganography refresher</h2>

<p>Steganography is the practice of concealing data within other data. A variety of different
common formats open themselves up to steganographic channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Image formats: using the least significant bits of the color space</li>
  <li>Audio formats: hiding information in background noise, or hiding an image
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a></li>
  <li>Plain text: using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">homographs</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner">special spacing characters</a> to encode information</li>
</ul>

<p>On its own, steganography is <em>not</em> a replacement for cryptography: it’s strictly
obfuscatory, and does not provide any deniablity of the embedded message if revealed.</p>

<p>That being said, there exist a variety of use cases for steganographic schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coupled with strong cryptography, they <em>do</em> allow for deniability: depending on the format,
an extracted message can be made indistinguishable from random noise prior to decryption.</li>
  <li>Steganography can be used for fingerprinting and asset management.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Identification_Code">Commercial printers</a> are well-known for doing this;
video games have also used it to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/09/steganography_i_1.html">track users and their machines</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="doing-steganography-on-computer-programs">Doing steganography on computer programs</h2>

<p>There are two obvious avenues for doing steganography on compiled programs. <em>steg86</em> does
<strong>neither</strong> of these, but for the sake of completeness:</p>

<h3 id="instrumenting-the-program-via-the-compiler">Instrumenting the program via the compiler</h3>

<p>Compilers perform instruction selection to lower their internal representations into machine code.
Instruction selection can be informed by any number of weights, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">register pressure</a>, individual instruction
performance (clock cycles, use of shared units), and feature availability
(e.g., selecting an older version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a>
to be compatible with more CPUs).</p>

<p>In this approach, the steganographer would control the compiler and its instruction selection
weights, encoding information in particular selections of instructions (or other parts of
code generation, like stack object order).</p>

<p>This affords a great deal of flexibility and control, but also makes it more difficult for the
compiler to perform optimal selections. It also requires the steganographer to maintain
their (forked) compiler. Not a bad idea, but requires a decent amount of effort.</p>

<h3 id="instrumenting-the-container-format">Instrumenting the container format</h3>

<p>Another approach is to ignore the compiled instructions themselves, and focus on the binary
container: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O">Mach-O</a>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable">PE</a>, among others.</p>

<p>These formats afford many opportunities for embedding information: the order
(both file and virtual address) of segments and sections, the order and layout
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_(computing)">relocation tables</a> and the composition of
their internal rules, and so on.</p>

<p>Instrumenting the binary format rather than the executable code means not having
to muck with instruction selection, but is also less bountiful in terms of
information density. It’s also not portable, e.g. tricks for hiding information
in ELF relocation entries would have to be tweaked for PEs.</p>

<h2 id="how-steg86-works">How <em>steg86</em> works</h2>

<p>Instead of controlling instruction selection or tweaking the details of the containing binary
format, <em>steg86</em> takes a third route: it uses the presence of <em>semantic duals</em> in the x86 and AMD64
instruction formats to selectively rewrite a program <em>after</em> compilation.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-duals">Semantic duals</h3>

<p>Like every ISA, x86 (and AMD64) have multiple ways to encode the semantics of a particular
(higher level, conceptual) operation. For example, clearing a register:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>; xor'ing a register with itself clears all bits</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>eax</span>

<span>; and'ing a register with 0 also clears all bits</span>
<span>and</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>

<span>; we could also set 0</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>

<span>; ...or subtract</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>eax</span>

<span>; ...or load a "computed" address that's always 0</span>
<span>lea</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…among many others. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work exactly as we’d like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each of these alternatives may have a different length when encoded, e.g. 2 bytes for
<code>xor eax, eax</code> versus 6 for <code>lea eax, [0]</code>. Consequently, rewriting one in terms of another
might entail a length change and subsequent relocation and displacement fixups.</li>
  <li>Each of these alternatives has subtle microarchitectural differences: they set and clear
different arithmetic flags, have different implicit segmentation behavior, and so on.
We don’t know perfectly whether the original operations took advantage of those details,
so many of our potential alternatives run the risk of subtle breakage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, this is <strong>not</strong> what <em>steg86</em> does.</p>

<p>Instead, <em>steg86</em> takes advantage of one of the quirks of the x86 instruction encoding: the ModR/M
byte:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/modrm.png" alt="The ModR/M byte."></p>

<p>The ModR/M byte is normally used to encode one or more explicit register and/or memory operands
to an opcode<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>: it’s how x86 can supply the rich range of source-to-sink modes that it has
(register-to-memory, memory-to-register, register-to-register, immediate-to-register, &amp;c).</p>

<p>Because register-to-memory and memory-to-register are both valid source-sink combinations for
many opcodes, many have encoding forms like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>; xor register with register/memory32 and store register/memory32</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>r</span><span>/</span><span>m32</span><span>,</span> <span>r32</span>

<span>; xor register/memory32 with register and store register</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>r32</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>/</span><span>m32</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Consequently, there are actually <strong>two</strong> ways to encode <code>xor eax, eax</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>; r/m32, r
31 C0

; r, r/m32
33 C0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These encodings are <em>semantic duals</em>: they have different opcodes, but belong to the same
instruction family, have the same length, and have the <em>exact same behavior and performance</em>.
We could replace every occurrence of <code>31 C0</code> with <code>33 C0</code> and our programs would happily chug along,
none the wiser.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there are actually quite a few of these duals on some of the most common
x86 instructions<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Each dual represents one bit of information: we can arbitrarily assign one form
to be <code>true</code> and its counterpart to be <code>false</code>. Given enough of them in a target
program, we can hide a message by translating between the forms. The result:
a binary that’s exactly the same size as the original and with the same performance
characteristics, but with a hidden message.</p>

<p>That’s all <em>steg86</em> does: it locates every semantic dual in its target program, maps
its input message to a bitstring, and translates each dual depending on its corresponding
message bit. Because it only uses duals, it’s completely agnostic to its containing format:
the <code>steg86</code> CLI currently supports ELF, Mach-O, and PE/PE32+ binaries.</p>

<p>Here’s what that actually looks like, with (some of the) differing bytes highlighted in red:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/steg86_vbindiff.png" alt="vbindiff between bash and steg'd bash"></p>

<p>And, of course, try it for yourself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>steg86 profile /bin/bash

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/steg86/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for prior work and
future refinements to <em>steg86</em>’s informational capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: An important note: because compilers and assemblers tend to select just one of the forms
above, <em>steg86</em> <strong>cannot</strong> provide deniability, even with strong encryption. Its transformations
will always look abnormal compared to a compiler-produced binary.</p>

            <h3>Body Weight Has Surprising, Alarming Impact on Brain Function</h3> 
			<h4>Higher BMI is linked to decreased cerebral blood flow, which is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and mental illness, according to a new study in JAD</h4>		</p><div>

							<em>August 5, 2020</em><br>
							<strong>Amsterdam, NL and Costa Mesa, CA, USA – As a person's weight goes up, all regions of the brain go down in activity and blood flow, according to a <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200655" target="_blank">new brain imaging study</a> in the <em><a href="http://j-alz.com/" target="_blank">Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</a></em>. One of the largest studies linking obesity with brain dysfunction, scientists analyzed over 35,000 functional neuroimaging scans using single-photon emission computerized tomography from more than 17,000 individuals to measure blood flow and brain activity. </strong>
						</p><p>Low cerebral blood flow is the #1 brain imaging predictor that a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease. It is also associated with depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, addiction, suicide, and other conditions. “This study shows that being overweight or obese seriously impacts brain activity and increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease as well as many other psychiatric and cognitive conditions,” explained Daniel G. Amen, MD, the study’s lead author and founder of Amen Clinics, one of the leading brain-centered mental health clinics in the United States</p>

<p>Striking patterns of progressively reduced blood flow were found in virtually all regions of the brain across categories of underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity, and morbid obesity. These were noted while participants were in a resting state as well as while performing a concentration task. In particular, brain areas noted to be vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease, the temporal and parietal lobes, hippocampus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and precuneus, were found to have reduced blood flow along the spectrum of weight classification from normal weight to overweight, obese, and morbidly obese.</p>

<p>Considering the latest statistics showing that 72% of Americans are overweight of whom 42% are obese, this is distressing news for America’s mental and cognitive health.</p>
<p>Commenting on this study, George Perry, PhD, Editor-in-Chief of the <em>Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease</em> and Semmes Foundation Distinguished University Chair in Neurobiology at The University of Texas at San Antonio, stated, “Acceptance that Alzheimer’s disease is a lifestyle disease, little different from other age-related diseases, that is the sum of a lifetime is the most important breakthrough of the decade. Dr. Amen and collaborators provide compelling evidence that obesity alters blood supply to the brain to shrink the brain and promote Alzheimer’s disease. This is a major advance because it directly demonstrates how the brain responds to our body.”</p>
<p>This study highlights the need to address obesity as a target for interventions designed to improve brain function, be they Alzheimer disease prevention initiatives or attempts to optimize cognition in younger populations. Such work will be crucial in improving outcomes across all age groups.</p>
<p>Although the results of this study are deeply concerning, there is hope. Dr. Amen added, “One of the most important lessons we have learned through 30 years of performing functional brain imaging studies is that brains can be improved when you put them in a healing environment by adopting brain-healthy habits, such as a healthy calorie-smart diet and regular exercise.”</p>

<p>The original AKAI MPC 3000 Classic released in 1994 as the step up from its predecessor, the MPC 60 (and the later MPC 60 mkII). MSRP was staggering, coming in at just under $4,000 in the early 90’s (a little over $7,000 in today’s money). It was clear that this machine was meant for professional studios and intended to be a tool for deliberate music applications.</p>

<p>The black AKAI MPC 3000 LE is a limited edition release of only 2000 individually numbered units in the year 2000. </p>



<p>There is a rumor that only 1400 units have been released to the public because as far as we know, the public has not seen any units numbered 1400 through 2000. Let it be known if you have one of these rare units.</p>

<h2>History of the AKAI MPC 3000</h2>



<h3>Roger Linn</h3>



<p>In 1980 Roger Linn designed and released the worlds first drum machine that uses samples called the LM-1, under his own company Linn Moffett Electronics with then partner Alex Moffett. Eventually Linn Electronics went out of business and the next chapter would be Roger Linn and Akai Professional linking up to create new products. The collaboration was a good fit because Akai needed a creative designer and Roger Linn wasn’t a fan of the manufacturing aspects of the business. In 1988 they would release the Akai MPC 60 and later followed by the updated MPC 60 MKII. In 1994 came the release of the MPC 3000, the celebrated upgrade from the MPC 60 line.</p>



<h3>MPC 60 vs MPC 3000</h3>



<ul><li>MPC 60: 12 bit audio – MPC 3000: 16 bit audio.</li><li>MPC 60 has 750KB of stock memory, expandable to 1.5 MB. The MPC 3000 has 2 MB of stock memory, expandable up to 32 MB.</li><li>The MPC 60 only has a single mono sampling input, while the MPC 3000 has dual stereo inputs.</li><li>MPC 60 has no filters whle the MPC 3000 comes equipped with a lowpass filter.</li><li>Both sound slightly different from eachother. Some prefer the 60, others prefer the 3000.</li></ul>



<p>Roger Linn’s vision for what a drum machine could be revolved around <em>grooves</em>. A drum machine had to have great groove to it. So he wanted it to be simple and be able to record exactly what you threw at it. This required the timing to be super tight in the MPC 3000. Linn made sure all the details were figured out for this on the backend and the result is a machine that grooves perfectly.</p>

<p>Hip-hop took an immediate kinship to the machine. Early notable users were producers like DJ Quik, Battlecat, Dr. Dre and J DIlla. The creation of the drum machine sampler ushered in innovation to a musical artform that was previously based around two turntables. The innovation of the sampler elevated the artform to a new frontier. Roger Linn himself has said that he did not anticipate this.</p>



<blockquote><p><em><span><b>”The AKAI MPC simultaneously </b></span><strong>digitized beat-making, progressed the pastiche musical form, and freed Hip-Hop from the confines of earlier technology.”</strong></em></p><cite><a href="https://happymag.tv/in-praise-of-the-akai-mpc-a-hip-hop-time-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HappyMag.Tv</a></cite></blockquote>



<h3>J Dilla</h3>



<p>J Dilla started to make a name for himself in the mid 90’s with classic records like Pharcyde’s “Runnin”, Janet Jackson’s “Got Til It’s Gone”, and Q-Tip’s “Breathe &amp; Stop”.</p>

<p>Out of Dilla’s music also spawned the R&amp;B sub-genre Neo-soul. Also connected to the MPC 3000 through J Dilla’s work.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that nobody else has displayed the MPC 3000’s groove capablities better than J Dilla. He was turning off the quantize setting during a time when literally everybody was relying on quantization for electronic music creation. He approached the MPC 3000 like a drummer would, and in turn he is regarded as one of the best drum programmers of all time.</p>

<h3>Dr. Dre</h3>



<p>After the release of the landscape-changing album <em>The Chronic 2001</em> in 1999 by Dr. Dre, more of the public started to take strong notice of the machine. Dr. Dre stated in an interview with Scratch Magazine that he used four or five different MPC 3000’s at one time for the creation of the album to avoid the drawbacks of using disks and memory. He shared that during this time his beats were layed down with the drums in the 3000 first, and everything else revolving around that.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts About the MPC 3000</h2>



<ul><li>There are no visual waveforms. You chop on the MPC 3000 with numbers, editing the start and end time of samples with numerical digits. Others would argue that you can chop by individually sampling each chop.</li><li>There is no EQ or FX in the MPC 3000. Only a lowpass filter and attack/decay, and delay.</li><li>You can only cutoff 2 other pads per pad. Compare this with modern drum machines where you can apply choke groups, etc. and cutoff any pad.</li></ul>



<h2>Why The MPC 3000 Is The Best Drum Machine of All Time</h2>



<p>To put it plainly, the simplicity.</p>



<p>Even though technically an MPC is a computer, the ushering in of personal computers as we know them today, and the fast innovation simply changed how music was being made. Workflow started to shift from unmanageably short sample times to hoards of collections of samples on hard drives. Modern workflow now allows freely auditioning any sized samples and endless decisions to be made with endless tools at your fingertips, effectively debilitating creativity very easily.</p>



<p>If Roger Linn had not been the first to incorporate sampling into drum machines, and then successfuly iterate on it leading into the release of the 3000, its safe to say that Hip-Hop and House music would not have taken it under their wing and catapulted the machine into the history books in the way that its heralded as a classic machine and musical instrument.</p>



<p>When you take a step back, its easy to realize that the 3000 was really where things peaked for drum machines. The MPC 3000 knocked it out of the park where it mattered most…. The sound, the timing, and the workflow. Drum machines that came after the MPC 3000 started to offer new abilities and functions, but traded them for things like the beefy analog sound and streamlined workflow.</p>



<p><strong>The Timing</strong></p>



<p>When you talk to fans of the MPC 3000, you hear them talk about “The Feel.” They will tell you that the feel of the 3000 is like no other drum machine or sampler that exists. This is due to the timing that Roger Linn built into the machine. The timing on the MPC 3000 is extremely tight and about as true as you can get. It will record exactly what you play. Essentially, it is the essense of what a “groovebox” is.<br>The sequencer on the MPC 3000 is second to none.</p>



<p><strong>The Sound</strong></p>



<p>Theres something about the sound of the MPC 3000. It’s the sampling engine, but it also seems to be more than that. For drums, while subtle… enthusiasts will tell you its unmatched. While the sampling engine will color sounds in its own way, the 3000 also seems to have a unique glue which provides subtle punch. Sounds will jump off of the track and manage to coexist beautifully on the 3000.</p>



<p><em>The low end on the MPC 3000 is amazing.</em></p>



<p>The MPC 3000 is very bottom heavy and thick in sound. Roger Linn has talked about how they tried to make it sound like a tape machine. And it clearly does. You can drive this machine extremely hot and loud without ever losing any bottom end.</p>



<p>You can’t really get a computer or any DAW to sound like an MPC 3000. Some claim its a matter of boosting the low end, and cutting some of the high end frequencies to match the sound of the 3000. This is simply false. There are much more nuances happening that have yet to be achieved on a computer… mostly the digitial to analog conversion. The DAC on the MPC 3000 is extremely unique. It’s a machine and it sounds like a machine, in a good way. In the best way possible.</p>



<p><strong>The Workflow</strong></p>



<p>The workflow is unmatched. It’s minimal, but it also gives you the proper buttons for only the functions and screens that you need. </p>



<p>The addition of a number pad is brilliant and is extremely useful allowing …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A question I often hear from teams - both new and established - is “should we host our stack on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>?”.  Given all the buzz it gets in the tech world a lot of people assume&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with k8s for several years - often with very powerful and complex platforms - and I think the truth is more&nbsp;nuanced.</p>
<p>Here’s my attempt at untangling that decision.  It’s geared toward startups and self-sufficient teams in wider organisations with responsibility for hosting their own products.  It might also have value to people in more traditional <span>IT</span> departments at larger&nbsp;organisations.</p>
<h3>How Can it Help&nbsp;Me?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t just a 2018-era buzzword.  It’s a robust, highly scalable system that allows you to construct application deployments out of well-considered primitives (<code>Pod</code>, <code>Service</code>, <code>Ingress</code> etc) then does its damnedest to make the reality match.  When applications crash it restarts them.  When whole swathes of underlying machines disappear it tries to replace them.  If you’re running numerous services (probably developed as a microservice architecture) and you’re looking for efficiency, resilience and a good story for deployment it can do a lot for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Want a basic degree of resilience in your service? (yes you do) - run <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/">multiple replicas</a> in your deployment then balance traffic between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>If your workload is ‘bursty’ (e.g. a lot of <span>API</span> traffic) you could build on this by rigging up <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/">autoscaling</a> to grow capacity when it’s needed.  This can save you a lot of money - instead of paying for peak capacity all of the time, provision a baseload amount to keep the platform ticking over and bring up more replicas when they’re needed.  And if you can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/custom-and-external-metrics">import the queue length</a> into your system autoscaling works for queue-based workloads&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Worried about your code breaking?  Configure liveness/readiness <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">probes</a> and Kubernetes will automatically restart your services when they fail.  Likewise for hardware failure - I’ve seen clusters who’ve lost half their nodes keep on trucking like nothing happened.  A well-configured and maintained Kubernetes cluster can be incredibly robust.  If you have the resources you might even try running a <a href="https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/">chaos-monkey</a>-like <a href="https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-monkey/chaos-monkey-alternatives/kubernetes/">tool</a> to make certain your stack will tolerate regular&nbsp;failures.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has excellent features for integrating with your <span>CI</span> workflow.  The most common pattern I see for this is a build (ideally standardised across all your projects) that pushes an image to a Docker registry then kicks your k8s cluster to load it.  Depending on taste that can be done by modifying the deployment to pull a new tag, or pointing the tag to the new image and triggering k8s to reload all pods.  In most cases (migrations ruin everything) deployment can be fully automated: if you trust your tests and feature flags it can be 100% automatic (aka <a href="https://www.continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery</a>); for the less brave a manual approval step after the build eases the pain.  Either way your developers should be able to release most builds to the cluster without any help from Kubernetes&nbsp;specialists.</p>
<p>In a similar vein to <span>CI</span> it can help you standardise logging and monitoring for your applications.  Doing this is by no means unique to Kubernetes, but having a single cluster-wide system that gathers together data about all your services in the same place can greatly ease the pain of debugging.  I’ve seen particularly good results come from using <a href="https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset">fluentd</a> to pipe json-structured logging output from applications into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/"><span>AWS</span> CloudWatch</a> and query it through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html">Insights</a>.</p>
<p>Finally it can do a great deal to increase efficiency - both at the hosting layer (i.e. jamming as many applications onto those expensive <span>EC2</span> instances as possible) and also reducing the time your developers need to spend deploying software.  Humans cost more than computers so for most organisations the second of these will be the biggest win.  But Kubernetes isn’t magic - I’ve seen some beautiful, efficient clusters and some total gas guzzlers.  <em>You’ll only save money with Kubernetes if you invest in using it&nbsp;correctly.</em></p>
<h3>Where Does Kubernetes&nbsp;Shine?</h3>
<p>First of all think about your workload.  What kind of applications do you need to run?  How do they talk to each other and the outside world?  From experience I’d say the following attributes make your stack a good&nbsp;fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadly speaking have you followed a microservice architecture?  There’s little value in Kubernetes if your world only has one application.  You’ll need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/">Dockerize</a> your applications to deploy them to k8s; doing this from day 1 of any project is a good way to make yourself think about the boundaries between&nbsp;services.</li>
<li>Are your services exposed to each other and the outside world via <span>HTTP</span>(s) (probably yes, it’s 2020)?  This will fit k8s’ model nicely and you can use one of the normal <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controllers</a> to front&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Are your applications suitable to be load balanced?  No local state (use PostgreSQL / Redis / whatever for that), communication over known endpoints, fast startup/shutdown.  That isn’t to say you can’t keep shortlived state like a Redis cache in your cluster but for many cases you’d do better to use the boxed services a cloud provider&nbsp;offers.</li>
<li>Kubernetes is also well suited to headless applications like batch processing (through its <code>Job</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/">controller</a>) and long-lived&nbsp;queue-consumers.</li>
<li>Is memory (and to a lesser extent <span>CPU</span>) usage predictable?  Kubernetes will try to host your applications on the same physical machines, so if one of them goes haywire and consumes all the <span>RAM</span> other workloads may be randomly killed.  In my experience this is the single biggest source of instability on Kubernetes clusters.  If you understand the resource usage of your applications you can declare a <code>resources.requests</code> and <code>resources.limits</code> to guarantee they’ll always get the memory they need and won’t be bad&nbsp;neighbours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely here are a few kinds of workload I <em>don’t</em> think you should use it&nbsp;for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static websites.  Typically you’d do this by baking your content into an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/">Nginx</a>-derived image and exposing it via your cluster’s ingress controller.  That’s a terrible way to host static content: all those little copies of Nginx need to be maintained, it’s inefficient and far less resilient / performant than it could be at the network level.  Sure you could stick it behind a <span>CDN</span> but if you’re doing that, why not have a cloud service host the content as&nbsp;well?</li>
<li>Hosting untrusted code.  That could mean applications supplied by your customers or third party code with a history of security problems, e.g. Wordpress or a dodgy library from <span>NPM</span>.  By default Kubernetes’ features for isolating workloads aren’t great.  You can add things like <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/">Calico</a> to control network access but it’s easy to screw up and your security model is always going to be 100% dependent on the container runtime.  The default for this (Docker, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">Linux cgroups</a>) offers a huge attack surface to compromised applications: if a codebase your cluster is running gets hacked an attacker will not find it hard to escalate their access to the rest of the cluster.  Interesting work is being doing on alternatives to cgroups (e.g. <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a>) but it’s not yet mainstream enough to recommend to the average&nbsp;user.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your workload isn’t a good fit you may still have options for shoehorning it into Kubernetes (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/">volumes</a> can be used for long-lived state), but expect to spend a lot of engineering time working around the problems.  A lot of them are bad practices anyhow so your resources time might be better spent designing them out of the stack altogether - they’re only going to hurt you further down the&nbsp;line.</p>
<h3>No Magic&nbsp;Bullet</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t a magic bullet.  It can help to move the complexities of hosting applications into a well-designed layer of their own but it won’t make them go away.  You’re always going to have to secure and maintain your&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>To make a cluster useful for the average workload a menagerie of add-ons will be required.  Some of them almost everyone uses, others are somewhat niche.  Examples include (the Nginx <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controller</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler">cluster-autoscaler</a> to add extra nodes when you don’t have enough capacity.  Having a bespoke set of software operating key features of the environment makes your cluster a unique snowflake and it needs to be managed as such.  Also they need to be updated regularly and can sometimes be of questionable quality.  Configuration management tools like <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> or <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs">Terraform</a> are nigh-on mandatory: tinker with a cluster by hand at your peril, absent a declarative setup you’ll never be able to spin up another in exactly the same way.  I’ve seen this lead to no end of problems when operating or replacing more mature&nbsp;clusters.</p>
<p>When running any nontrivial stack on Kubernetes a degree of curation is always going to be required.  Letting anybody deploy whatever they like, however they like to your cluster can only lead to chaos.  You’ll end up with mess of inconsistently named applications scattered across dozens (or worse, one) namespaces with nobody knowing how they fit together.  Congratulations: you took your old spaghetti infrastructure and replaced it with a new flavour of spaghetti infrastructure, just served on a cooler kind of&nbsp;plate.</p>
<p>The most successful Kubernetes implementations I’ve seen are those where infrastructure specialist(s) work with developers to make sure workloads are well-configured, standardised, protected from one another and have defined patterns of communication.  They’ll handle the initial setup of an application on an infrastructure, hopefully wired up to a build/release system so dev teams can ship new versions of the code without help.  In a lot of ways this mirrors the wider culture of your organisation - if engineering is a chaotic free-for-all of bad communication and ill-defined responsibilities your hosting environment will mirror it.  At best this leads to unreliability; at worst an unreliable, unmaintainable, expensive&nbsp;mess.</p>
<h3>Cost of&nbsp;Ownership</h3>

			<p>My fridge was recently full of instant film. I mean that literally, it was not possible for me to put any more packets of the film into the fridge without risking damaging them:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/fridge.jpg"></p>

<p>I had acquired all of the film one day when my printer sent me an email asking if I wanted to purchase 93 packs of Fujifilm FP-100c for 2,790.- CHF. That’s 30.- CHF per box, about three times what this film used to retail for and about one third of what it currently sells for<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. So I thought about the offer for five minutes, then said yes.</p>

<p>I figured I could sell half of the packs and recoup my costs, after various expenses, then I would have around 45 boxes that I could shoot a photo project with. So I picked the film up and thanked my printer. He even included the above fridge, three Polaroid cameras, and a bunch of accessories for free. So whichever way I spin this, even if a few packs went missing in the post, I would still be close to doubling my investment <em>at the least</em> if I decided to sell all the film. Not bad.</p>

<p>The film had been discontinued, at least announced to be, in early 2016. The film was still available on a wholesale level up until sometime in 2018 so people had started stockpiling it and the prices inevitably went up. The problem with photographic film is that it will start go off in a few years as the chemicals break down, so it needs to be cold stored. This is especially the case with instant film as there are chemicals not just to record the image but also the entire development process is included in each frame.</p>

<p><strong>Instant Film</strong></p>

<p>There’s a market for this stuff as there is a range of old cameras and backs for other cameras that can only function with it. The film comes in dedicated plastic packs that the cameras/backs are designed to work with. You load a pack, fiddle about a bit, and you are ready to shoot. Like other instant films you take the shot, pull out the frame, give it a minute or two, then “peel apart” the frame to reveal the image.</p>

<p>The film can still be bought “new” on auction sites, some analog specific photography stores, and private sellers; but all of the film is now expired as the last batch was marked to do so in early 2019, so there’s a risk involved in any purchase of this film if you want it “fresh”. To purchase a single box of the film from one of the last batches you should expect to pay around 100.- CHF. Ten times what it originally retailed for.</p>

<p>Given there are ten frames in each box, and due to the fickle nature of the cameras that shoot this type of film you can often lose one or even two frames due to mechanical or exposure issues, you’re paying in the region of 12.- CHF <em>per photo</em>.</p>

<p>This is not a case of having to learn how to load and use the film - sometimes you just have bad luck. The paper mechanism used to pull out the shot frame and prepare the next sometimes tears. Just last week I was using some and the first frame leader from the box tore, I had to open the camera to retrieve the next leader and lost another three frames in the process. Somehow the third frame managed to hide amongst the rest and turned up again between the 6th and the 7th frame, something I’ve not experienced before.</p>

<p>This is not fun, it’s quite ridiculous, and if I’m being honest I don’t see the point of this stuff and find it all very annoying. I say that as someone who is steeped in the film process. Sure I understand the aesthetic and the tangible nature of the process, but that’s not for me. I mean, if you really want to shoot it that’s fine, but at this price point I would now prefer to <a href="https://leejo.github.io/projects/bergbahnen/polaroids/">emulate it</a>, at least when the reason to do so is to have some sort of contextual point for the aesthetic. Each to their own of course.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/freezer.jpg"></p>

<p>Anyway, Fuji have got form with this. I’ve been using some of their film stocks for close to two decades so have seen product lines come and go, and my other fridge/freezer (above) contains some of those products that I do continue to use. Of course you can still purchase some of the discontinued film if you really want to. A few of those I use or used to are detailed below, and this is in no way an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_discontinued_photographic_films#Fujifilm">exhaustive list</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Neopan 1600</strong> - A mid to high speed black and white film that had a grain structure that I haven’t seen in other films. I used this quite a bit when shooting skate photos but it was never available in formats larger than 35mm so I stopped when I moved exclusively to medium format. You see this now and then for sale, but it won’t be good to shoot as it’s <em>at least</em> a decade expired and mid-high speed film doesn’t last more than a few years after expiry unless it’s frozen; and of course you can’t guarantee the storage history.</p>

<p>I have seen this selling for 30 to 50.- CHF for a <em>single</em> roll of 35mm, or 250.- CHF for ten packs. That’s five to ten times its original retail price.</p>

<p><strong>Fuji Fortia</strong> - a once/twice off colour slide film that was released around 2005. It was like Fuji’s Velvia 50 (detailed below) but with even more saturated reds. There were rumours that it was a batch of Velvia that didn’t pass quality control, so Fuji sold it as a special edition for the cherry blossom season in Japan. It was available for a couple of years so probably just a single run, which does backup the “it was a messed up Velvia batch” rumor.</p>

<p>You see rolls of this for sale now and then, with the price approaching ten times what it originally retailed for. This was available in medium format so I did shoot it and you can see what I mean about the saturation from the image below, which I actually had to <em>desaturate</em> a little in post as it was just too much.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/2008_poppies_cambs.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Acros 100</strong> - Another Fuji speciality, a medium to slow speed black and white film that offered four selling points: extremely fine grain for its box speed (100 ISO), very contrasty in normal development, very sharp, and very good reciprocity failure rates. You can shoot exposures up to several minutes long with little adjustment required, which may well be unique amongst all film stocks.</p>

<p>This was discontinued a couple of years ago but then came back as Acros II, however it is no longer Fuji manufacturing it and I believe it is a co-operation with Ilford<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is probably a good thing, however the 4x5 version of the film is not being made and luckily I stocked up on this a few months before its original discontinuation was announced so I have enough to last me for a few years at least. I am using this film for a specific project, which is why I bought a few boxes; my current count is 12 remaining, that’s 240 frames.</p>

<p>I rarely see this for sale in its 4x5 version, and those I do see tend to not be from the final batches, which had expiry dates of 2019-10. This was selling for about 70.- CHF a box when it was available and I suspect those final batch boxes would go for at least twice that now.</p>

<p><strong>Velvia 50</strong> - The classic landscape (and Formula 1?<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>) photographer’s slide film. Very popular up until around, I dunno, 2005? It’s still going, but i suspect will be discontinued soon. It’s no longer available outside Japan in large format sizes, and Fuji have cut down on the number of options for it in smaller sizes. Also of note is that when I was stockpiling it the boxes had very short expiry dates, less than a year, suggesting that sales have slumped. Since then the price in Japan has gone up 50% so it’s no longer a compelling option.</p>

<p>I still shoot this, but it’s very fickle. It needs graduated neutral density filters in many cases (which I don’t have) and suffers from terrible reciprocity failure and very easy over/under exposure even if you know what you’re doing. You often have to bracket your exposures +/- a stop, which is not cheap when shooting large format film. When you get it right you understand why it was number one it its niche, again another shot that I had to pull back the saturation:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/lac_leman_2019.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>What Does This All Mean</strong></p>

<p>Discontinued film stocks are selling for twice to ten times their original retail price, so should you invest in film? Nah, not at all. Unless you discover a batch of Fuji FP-100c that’s been cold stored, is from 2018 or 2019, and selling at less than 40.- CHF a box, in which case go for it and double your investment. Clearly there is a market for discontinued photographic film emulsions, but they’re a niche within a niche and we’re now down to the products that don’t offer a unique selling point.</p>

<p>The discontinuation of the above stocks doesn’t mean much, really - you can just switch to another stock and adjust as necessary. Yeah it’s frustrating at first, but that’s the nature of film. The issue with Fuji FP-100c being discontinued is that it also renders an entire range (and more) of cameras unusable<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. There are no other options, or at least limited options, to continue using the cameras<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>That’s what’s kind of sad about this entire thing, although I guess that is the end state of all technology designed around using refills to function. Printers, things with fixed internal batteries, liquid fuel vehicles, SodaStreams? There’s more of these than you think. We will still have 35mm film for a long time I suspect, and 120 and 4x5 and 8x10 and so on; but some of the more niche products are approaching obsolescence and thus unavailability. We can retrofit some of the technology that require these refills, but eventually the expense isn’t worth it.</p>

<p>My reasons for shooting film are because it gives me access to alternative formats and some technical controls that I can’t get elsewhere, at least not at an affordable price point<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. Movements, a square or panoramic frame, an alternative way to interact with my subjects. An interesting observation about instant film is the reaction to it, compared to shooting a digital image that is effectively the same. The tangible nature of the process really is a hook.</p>

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>In this episode of the “<a href="https://kislayverma.com/category/for-the-layman/">For the layman</a>” series, I am going to discuss what the “cloud” is. We’ve all heard of iCloud, AWS, cloud computing etc, and understand the power of their ubiquitous presence. Let’s understand the history and the mechanics of the Cloud a little more.</p>
<hr>
<p><span><strong>tl;dr –</strong> The Cloud is Uber for computers. It is made up of hundreds of thousands of computers (aka servers) that users can rent out to run their software in exchange for a regular fee – mostly based on usage. Cloud companies take care of running the hardware with all kinds of best practices so that software developers and software development companies don’t have to and can focus on their core work.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Have you ever seen one of those high intensity surgery scenes in movies where the doctor keeps shouting at the nurses “Give me a clamp” or “Give me 5cc of &lt;insert medicine name&gt;”? For the longest time, software development used to be like (only less high stakes for the most part). Programmers would write awesome <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">applications that could eat the world</a>. But running these awesome apps required big computers. So while the programmer finished writing the last line of code or polishing the last bit of documentation (HAHAHAHA), she would start screaming, “Give me a big computer”.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1024x637.jpg" alt="" width="506" height="314" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1024x637.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-300x187.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-768x478.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1536x955.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1142x706.jpg 1142w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1070x665.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer.jpg 1603w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px"></figure></div>
<p>For many years, this meant going out and buying the computer, plugging it in, installing a bazillion things on it, and forever making sure no one pulled out the plug by mistake. I’m not even getting into the bureaucracy of procuring said computer. As companies started churning out more and more software, this got to be a real problem. With the rise of the cloud, today the application developer could herself set up a new computer with no more than a few clicks of the mouse. No fuss at all. <strong>The cloud has commoditized hardware and the operations around it.</strong></p>
<p>To understand the rise of cloud computing, let’s look a little bit at the history of computers and their use.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first programmable computer was (arguably) the one developed by Alan Turing’s team in Bletchley Park as part of the allied effort at intelligence gathering in WW2. “<strong>Programmable Computer</strong>” means that this was a machine that could be arranged to do any calculation. Configured one way, it could crack the Nazi ENIGMA code. Set up another way, it could compute the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/six-things-probably-didnt-know-pi/">value of Pi</a> to the umpy-umpth decimal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is remarkable by itself because most machines now or since do only one thing. A screwdriver, a bulldozer, an airplane, all of them do exactly one thing. Even the “swiss knife” is a collection of many machines, each for one purpose. So this “programmable computer” was a breakthrough in its own right because you could get it to do anything by programming it in different ways.</p>
<p>Anyhow, with a dazzling array of innovations in hardware and computer science, it came to be that computers became commonplace. They could be found in people’s homes, and what we know today as Silicon Valley was beginning to take shape. However, access to computers at the scale at which this new computing revolution wanted it was still not easy. You could easily buy a computer for your home or office, but buying 50 computers was still a pain. Marc Randolph recounts the story from the launch day of Netflix in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07QRVWBX2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B07QRVWBX2">That will never work</a> about how his team were constantly rushing out to buy more computers from a neighbourhood shop because of the unexpectedly large number of people visiting the website.</p>
<p>Since this buy-on-demand model did not work very well, software companies started buying and keeping computers in their office (this is still done widely and is called <strong>on-premise/on-prem</strong>). IT teams would set up the computers, power system, air conditioning, cable layouts, failsafes etc in some designated area in the office. This meant that the company always had a buffer stock of computing power at hand. The cost of this was the capital tied up in all the servers whether being used or not.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-1013x1024.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="519" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-1013x1024.jpg 1013w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-297x300.jpg 297w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-150x150.jpg 150w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-768x776.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-1070x1081.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments.jpg 1233w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></figure></div>
<p>And you know what the sneaky software developers did (and have been doing since)? They found out that getting computers wouldn’t be so much of a pain anymore, so they started churning out even more software. Sooo much more of it. Easy supply further fuelled the hunger for computational resources.</p>

<p>The other problem for companies was that off-the-shelf computers came in certain specific sizes. Roughly speaking, <strong>a computer is made up of storage (Hard disk), computing power (CPU cores), memory (RAM) and the network (LAN/Internet)</strong>. But in the new digital age, all kinds of programs were being written which demanded each of these in different combinations. Some wanted a lot of network but didn’t do much computing (Netflix, Zoom), some stored a lot of data but didn’t have to be fast (data backup systems), and so on.</p>
<p>Most companies couldn’t afford to keep all combinations of such machines at hand. It was too expensive to buy and they would have had to keep a team of engineers for this alone. So some smart folks at IBM, the premier computing company of its time, came up with the idea of <strong>Virtualization</strong>. Virtualization allowed us to hide multiple computers and all their resources behind a curtain and think in terms of their aggregate resources. E.g. Ten 4 core computers with 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage each became a collection of 40 cores, 80 GB RAM, and 2560GB of storage which could be parcelled out into “<strong>virtual machines</strong>” as per the programmer’s requirement. e.g. All of the above mentioned resources could be combined to make 2 huge virtual machines (aka VMs) of 20 cores, 40 GB RAM, and 1280GB storage. Wide adoption of virtualization has since hidden the actual computers (aka <strong>bare metal</strong>) from the programmers view.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1024x753.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="338" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-300x220.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-768x564.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1536x1129.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1070x786.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization.jpg 1664w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>
<p>While virtualization gave organization’s huge leeway in terms of deploying computational resources efficiently, it also introduced a huge “<strong>Virtualization Layer</strong>” to the already complex stack of hundreds, sometimes thousands of computers they were running. Some companies were reaching the stage where they couldn’t house all their servers in their offices and had to open up <strong>data-centers</strong> (separate facilities for storing and operating all the servers). This was obviously a huge capital investment and distraction for these companies. They didn’t want to be in the business of running hardware, but they had no choice.</p>
<p>Around the dot com crash of the 90s, some companies (especially Amazon) had a lot of computers and expertise in operating them, and were looking to make some money. They realized that with the internet potentially connecting all computers of the world to each other, they could not only rent out their servers to people who needed to use them, but also sell their expertise in operating them reliably as a service with the hardware. This was the origin of the <strong>cloud</strong> (or <strong>cloud computing</strong> or <strong>cloud services</strong>) as we know it today.</p>
<p>The users of the cloud (the renters of the servers) essentially reach out into the Cloud to lay their hands on mostly Virtual Machines as per their computing needs without worrying about where they kept, which brand they are, and whether they are connected to the power supply or not. Cloud companies like AWS, Azure, GCP, Digital Ocean (where this blog is hosted) take care of all that so we can just focus on running the cool Facemash applications we have written. Users pay an hourly, or monthly, or some other sort of recurring charge based on their usage of these machines. No more scrambling around to buy computers, connect them etc etc. With heavy automation, today even individual developers can manage more computing power than entire teams not too long ago.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cloud-providers-and-users-923x1024.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="481" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cloud-providers-and-users-923x1024.jpg 923w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cloud-providers-and-users-271x300.jpg 271w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cloud-providers-and-users-768x852.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cloud-providers-and-users-1070x1187.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cloud-providers-and-users.jpg 1359w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px"></figure></div>
<p>In the last decade, this process of cloudification has gone beyond hardware and even into the realm of software. Most cloud providers have “<strong>managed services</strong>” under which they provide well set up and maintained installations of the most commonly used software already running. We don’t even have to set up this software now – we just rent a running version of it for our own purposes -as if it was a physical thing. This is a huge blessing for startups since some of the most commonly used types of software like databases, firewalls, caches, message queues are available at only a few clicks notice and don’t have to be installed and operated. The barrier to entry in the software world has never been lower with more and more of the grunt work being moved off to the cloud.</p>
<p>Think of cloud hardware and software in terms of the “<a href="https://kislayverma.com/for-the-layman/for-the-layman-ep-1-what-is-a-distributed-system/">distributed car</a>” I had discussed in a previous article. The engine, the wheels, the fuel injection system etc are all in the cloud now, and you can have as many of them as you can pay for. As the car maker, you can now focus on your unique value addition – the branding, the interiors and leather seats, the new electric battery that only you hold the patent to, and so on.</p>
<p>Today, the cloud is part of the internet’s infrastructure like highways or schools for the real world. Most people want highways and schools as a means to an end. They don’t want to have to build them themselves. The cloud plays the same role for anyone that wants to build software. The result – omnipresent software and huge cloud provider bills 🙂</p>

	<p>Looking at Mozilla’s finances, it’s reasonable to conclude that Google is keeping them on life support to keep the anti-trust hounds at bay. Mozilla’s deal with Google will account for at least 70% of their revenues going forward. That’s over $400 million to be the default search provider in 4% of browsers. For 1 year. I’ll bet my next paycheck that Google reupped this rather generous agreement to avoid a repeat of Microsoft’s troubles over an Internet Explorer monopoly. My guess is that Google will decide it’s in their interest to pull the plug right around the time this latest wave of anti-trust talk blows over.</p>

<p>With the troubles at Mozilla, Google is one step closer to replicating the WeChat and Facebook walled-garden model on the Web. A quick survey a the field of play shows just how far Google has come in capturing the once open Web.</p>

<h2 id="browser-war-is-over">(Browser) War is over</h2>

<p>Chrome’s ability to dictate web standards will only get stronger over time. Safari and Firefox have been able to apply some shame to Chrome on things like disabling third-party cookies, but soon it’ll just be Apple left with a voice.</p>

<p>But Google doesn’t even need Chrome to dictate standards since it controls the Web’s front door. AMP, a technology no one asked for, is now on over 70% of all marketing websites for no other reason than Google said so.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget that most people now access the web via mobile devices, 75% of which run Google’s Android.</p>

<h2 id="original-sins">Original Sins</h2>

<p>Two deficiencies have determined the course the Web has taken: lack of native search and lack of native payments.</p>

<p>Lacking native distributed search allowed Google to grab a monopoly position as the entry point to the web. The Web’s orignal architects were off base on hyperlinks; it turns out people just want to skip right to the answer they’re looking for. There was once the beginnings of an alternative in public bookmarking sites, but social networks came and sucked all the air out of that space.</p>

<p>Lack of a safe and easy way of exchanging funds was a big factor in advertising becoming the dominant business model on the Web. No-charge services became the norm because, for a long time, there was no reasonable way to pay for them. Enter advertising to fill the void. I think it’s safe to say that Google’s AdWords is the dominant advertising platform on the open Web, which means it holds a commanding position in the Web’s finances.</p>

<p>I’m also going to throw in an honorable mention to poor native video support (it is hyper_text_ after all). It’s beating a dead horse to point out that Google also serves up the vast majority of videos streamed on the Web.</p>

<h2 id="so-then">So then…</h2>

<p>So Google controls the Web’s search and video infrastructure. It can and does dictate standards and media formats. It also controls a huge chunk of the revenues available when publishing and selling on the Web. It even controls the operating system and browser through which most people interact with it.</p>

<p>Google’s capture of the Web is a <em>fait accompli</em>. Only legislation will keep the World Wide Web from finally becoming Web by Google (TM).</p>

          <p>I worked at Amazon for 17 years as a network engineer. Now I’m out of Amazon and looking at the industry, I’m learning new things. <strong>One of the things I’ve learned recently is that OSPF shouldn’t be used for Clos leaf-spine networks because of scale.</strong> I’ve heard that it can’t keep up with the size and scale of the modern datacenter networks. <a href="https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/release-independent/solutions/topics/task/configuration/ip-fabric-underlay-cloud-dc-configuring.html">Juniper IP Fabric Underlay Network Design and Implementation</a> is an example of the recommendation.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938</a> is what as used as the reference for using eBGP to be the routing protocol inside of large Clos networks.</p>

<p><strong>This is a shock to me</strong> since we built large OSPF Clos networks a decade ago. We built networks this way with hundreds of routers (even thousands) speaking OSPF. I’m not saying it is easy or that we didn’t have to understand OSPF well; If you don’t design it well, you get a flooding disaster. But if you do set it up right, it works really well. It converges quickly and doesn’t collapse under failure. The key thing is to be sure you understand how flooding works and you focus on areas and summarization. There are different things you have to be aware of when you are designing a Clos network with BGP vs OSPF. With BGP you have to be figure out how to mitigate path hunting. With OSPF need to work on how to avoid congestion collapse.</p>

<p>There is also work on building new protocols for these large Clos or Clos-like networks, such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/</a>. I don’t understand why OSPF or ISIS isn’t good enough so I don’t understand why these are necessary. There <a href="https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG74/1763/20181003_Martin_Routing_In_Dense_v1.pdf">are some good ideas in RIFT</a>, I’m just haven’t seen a reason to use it.</p>

<p>When we did this we were using CPUs from 2003 and we were using a lesser known OSPF stack. It’s OSPF implementation was okay, but we were strongly warned away from using their BGP implementation by the developers. <strong>We had to understand and mitigate risk</strong>. We had to test it as well as we could and be very careful in our first deployments. The stack had never been battle tested like this before. We still ran into some scary performance issues but got to work with great software engineers on the protocol stack to work through problems and figure out our scale.</p>

<p>Others agree with me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg</a>, even though they are mostly focusing on smaller networks than I was working on. But either way, OSPF can be made to work just fine on very large (or small) Clos networks.</p>

<p>As an example of the scale, this is a generic 24 port 3-tier Clos. It is possible to make OSPF work on this. This is smaller than what we were working on in 2012.
<img src="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/assets/images/24port-3tier-clos-resize.png" alt="24 port 3-tier clos"></p>

<p>To understand and then mitigate the risks an unknown OSPF stack, at scale, is why I started building a configuration management system and started <a href="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/Network-Validation-with-Vagrant/">simulating our network design</a>. We needed to understand how any OSPF protocol stack would work. Could we make the protocol scale at all? We needed to see what would actually happen with a real OSPF implementation. <strong>I cannot stress enough how important this simulation was.</strong> We did not understand the problem of flooding and we did not understand the solution until we had tried it out in simulation.</p>

<p>Before that, though, we spent a lot of time on white boards arguing about topology and OSPF. <strong>I think whiteboards are the most important tool for network design</strong> currently available, which makes me sad. I wish that wasn’t true, I want much better tools. I can’t even tell you the number of disasters averted by 2-3 great network engineers arguing over a whiteboard. This works really well, but there are important reasons it’s not good enough. One is that for many of these discussions, it’s extremely hard to get data to make the decisions. In this case, a comparison of convergence time and failure detection in a 3-tier Clos with eBGP, iBGP, and OSPF should be required, but we didn’t have that capability.</p>

<p>In a dense mesh-like network such as a Clos network, the concerns around OSPF swirled around four main issues: the effect of flooding, the size of the link state database, the speed of SPF calculations, and the ability for OSPF to carry a large number of prefixes. We were concerned about OSPF scaling w.r.t. its flooding and it’s the flooding that is expensive with a Link State Database protocol, not the Shortest Path First (SPF) calculations. Which means you have to be very careful about what is flooded, what are the areas, and how things are summarized. I didn’t understand this until I had a simulation and I could try things out with areas or without, and the effect was dramatic. I think it’s often true that there is a part of a design that you don’t understand, which is one of the big reasons to do simulation. We didn’t have the ability to lab up a network as big as we were going to be building, so the simulation was critical. I can’t even imagine what we would have done without it. Based on the simulation, we created targeted tests for real hardware to understand how it would deal with the scale.</p>

<p>The point of this article is not that OSPF is better than BGP, but that it does work in very large size Clos networks. I’m frustrated that so much of the industry went a direction without great data or analysis, just following one set of opinions and design choices. <strong>I wish there were easy ways for people to be able to design, simulate and test different designs</strong> like this so that they could decide for themselves the tradeoffs they’d like to make, rather than have to rely on some type of industry hype. There needs to be a better way to be able to describe topologies and designs so that it’s really easy to try out different ideas.</p>

<p>If you have other considerations, such as you want to run IPv6, or EVPN, a single instance of eBGP such as the one popularized by the open source routing suite, FRR, maybe the simplest or elegant. But with proper design, scale is not the reason to use BGP over OSPF. If you are running a small Clos network and don’t have IPv6 or EVPN, OSPF is more straightforward and generally faster, as was the common practice before the advent of BGP in the data center.</p>

<p>No matter what, you need to understand the choices that you are making and understand the tradeoffs. This is hard to do, and especially hard in networking because we lack design patterns and good tools to help us understand the implications of our choices.</p>

<p>If anybody knows about tools or design patterns or even somebody who’s actually compared OSPF vs BGP in Clos networks with data, I’d love to hear about it.</p>

<p>Looking at some “exciting” <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html">features landing in Python 3.8</a>, I’m still disappointed and frustrated by the language… like by quite a few other languages.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="7204" data-permalink="https://ilya-sher.org/chimpanzee-978809_640/" data-orig-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg" data-orig-size="640,640" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D7000&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0015625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="chimpanzee-978809_640" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" src="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" alt="" srcset="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg 640w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=150 150w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></div>



<p>As an author of another programming language, I can’t stop thinking about how things “should have been done” from my perspective. I want to be explicit here. My perspective is <strong>biased</strong> towards correctness and “WTF are you doing?”. Therefore, take everything here with a appropriate amount of salt.</p>



<p>Yes, not talking about any “positive” changes here.</p>



<h2>Assignment Expressions</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is new syntax <code>:=</code> that assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.</p></blockquote>



<p>A fix which couldn’t be the best because of previous design decision.</p>



<p>“Somebody” ignored the wisdom of Lisp, which was “everything is an expression and evaluates to a value” (no statements vs expressions), and made assignment a statement in Python years ago. Now this can not be fixed in a straightforward manner. It must be another syntax. Two different syntaxes for almost the same thing which is <code>=</code> for assignment as a statement and <code>:=</code> for expression assignment.</p>



<h2>Positional-only Parameters</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is a new function parameter syntax <code>/</code> to indicate that some function parameters must be specified positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments:</p></blockquote>



<pre><code>def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):
    print(a, b, c, d, e, f)</code></pre>



<p>Trying to clean up a mess created by mixing positional and named parameters. Unfortunately I did not give it enough thought at the time and copied parameters handling behaviour from Python. Now <a href="https://ngs-lang.org/">NGS</a> also has the same problem as Python had before 3.8. Hopefully, I will be able to fix it in some more elegant way than Python did.</p>



<h2>LRU cache</h2>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache"><code>functools.lru_cache()</code></a> can now be used as a straight decorator rather than as a function returning a decorator. So both of these are now supported</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Bug fix. But … (functools.py)</p>



<pre><code>    if isinstance(maxsize, int):
        # Negative maxsize is treated as 0
        if maxsize &lt; 0:
            maxsize = 0</code></pre>



<p>If you are setting LRU cache size to a negative number, it’s 99% by mistake. In NGS that would be an exception. That’s the approach that causes <code>rm -rf $myfolder/</code> to remove <code>/</code> when <code>myfolder</code> is unset. Note that the <code>maxsize</code> code is not new but it’s still there in Python 3.8. I guess that is another mistake which can not be easily fixed now because that would break “working” code.</p>



<h2>Collections</h2>



<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.somenamedtuple._asdict"><code>_asdict()</code></a> method for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple"><code>collections.namedtuple()</code></a> now returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#dict"><code>dict</code></a> instead of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict"><code>collections.OrderedDict</code></a>. This works because regular dicts have guaranteed ordering since Python 3.7</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Everybody had the mistake of making maps unordered: Perl, Ruby, Python.</p>



<ol><li>Ruby <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2009/02/04/ruby-19-internals-ordered-hash/">fixed that with the release of version 1.9</a> in 2008 (according to the post).</li><li>Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/">fixed that with the release of version 3.7</a> in 2018 (which I take as 10 years of “f*ck you, the developer”).</li><li>Perl <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/keys.html">keeps using unordered maps according to documentation</a>.</li><li>Same for Raku, again according to <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/hashmap">the documentation</a>.</li></ol>



<p>NGS had ordered maps from the start but that’s not a fair comparison because NGS project started in 2013, when the mistake was already understood.</p>



<hr>



<p>How all that helps you, the reader? I encourage deeper thinking about the choice of programming languages that you use. From my perspective, all languages suck, while NGS aims to suck less than the rest for the intended <a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki/Use-Cases">use cases</a> (tl;dr – for DevOps scripting).</p>



<hr>



<h2>Update 2020-08-16</h2>



<p>Discussions:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823</a></li><li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again">https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again</a></li></ol>



<h2>Update 2020-08-17</h2>



<p>It looks like the article above needs some clarification about my perspective: background, what I am doing and why.</p>



<h3>TL;DR</h3>



<p>The main points of the article are:</p>



<ol><li>Everything still sucks, including Python. By sucks I mean does not fit well with the tasks I need to do neither aligned with how I think about these tasks.</li><li>I am trying to help the situation and the industry by developing my own programming language</li></ol>



<h3>Background about my Thinking</h3>



<p>In general, I’m amazed with how bad the overall state of programming is. That includes:</p>



<ol><li>All programming languages that I know including my own NGS. This is aggravated by inability to fix anything properly for any language with substantial amount of code written in it because you will be breaking existing code. And if you do break, you get the shitstorm like with Python 3 or Perl 6 (Raku).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/MohGovIL/hamagen-react-native/issues/115">Code quality</a> of the programs written in all languages. Most of the code that I have seen is bad. Sometimes even in <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cpp-docs/issues/1929">official examples</a>.</li><li>Quality of available materials, which are sometimes <a href="https://dev.to/ilya_sher_prog/comment/m9oe">plainly wrong</a>.</li><li>Many of existing “Infrastructure as code” solutions, which in most cases follow the same path:<ol><li>Invent  a DSL or use YAML.</li><li>“figure out” later that it’s not powerful enough (by the way there is an elegant solution – a programming language, forgot the name)</li><li>Create pretty ugly programming language on top of a DSL that was intended for data.</li></ol></li></ol>



<p>I am creating new programming language and a shell out of <strong>frustration with current situation, especially with bash and Python</strong>. Why these two? Because that’s what I was and still using to get my tasks done.</p>



<p>Are these languages bad? I don’t think it’s a question with any good answers. <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2017/10/10/why-i-have-no-favorite-programming-language/">These languages don’t fit the tasks that I’m trying to do</a> nor are aligned with how I think while being apparently one of the best choices available.</p>



<h3>This Article Background</h3>



<ol><li>Seen some post on RSS about new features in Python 3.8.</li><li>Took a look.</li><li>Yep, everything is still f*cked up.</li><li>Wrote a post about it which was not meant to be “deep discussion about Python flaws”.</li></ol>



<p>I was not planning to invest more time in this but here I am trying to clarify.</p>



<h3>And your Language is Better? Really?</h3>



<p>Let’s clarify “better”.  For me, it’s to suck less than the rest for the intended use cases.</p>



<blockquote><p>author really does consider himself a superior language designer than the Python core-dev team</p></blockquote>



<p>( From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/</a> )</p>



<p>I consider myself in much easier circumstances:</p>



<ol><li>No substantial amount of code is written in NGS yet.</li><li>I’m starting later and therefore have the advantage of looking at more languages, avoiding bad parts, copying (with adaptation) the good parts.</li><li>NGS targets a niche, it’s not intended to be general purpose language. Choices are clearer and easier when you target a niche.</li><li>The language that I’m creating is almost by definition is more aligned with how I think. Hoping that people out there will benefit from using NGS if it is more aligned with how they think too.</li><li>See also my <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2016/10/28/creating-a-language-is-easier-now/">Creating a language is easier&nbsp;now</a> (2016) post.</li></ol>



<p>Will I be able to make a “better” language?</p>



<p><strong>From technical perspective</strong>, that’s probable: I am a skilled programmer in several languages and I have languages to look at more than everybody else had before. My disadvantage is not much experience in language design. I’m trying to offset that with thinking hard (<a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki#design-documents">about the language</a>, the essence of <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2019/05/18/on-information-loss-in-software/">what is being expressed</a>, common patterns, etc), looking at other languages and experimenting.</p>



<p><strong>From marketing perspective</strong>, I need to learn a lot. I am aware that “technically better” doesn’t matter as much as I would like to. Without community and users that would be a failed project.</p>



<p>Also don’t forget luck which I might or might not have.</p>



<h3>What if NGS fails?</h3>



<p>I think that the situation today is unbearable. I’m trying to fix it. I feel like I have to, despite the odds. I hope that even if NGS fails to move the industry forward it would be useful to somebody who will attempt that later.</p>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially. This is shown in the following graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png 600w"><figcaption>Average time to create one object increases with the number of objects on the heap <a href="https://jsperf.com/cost-of-objects">(Data Source)</a></figcaption></figure><p>So the question arises if CRDTs are actually suitable for shared editing on the web, or if they impose a too significant cost to be viable in practice.</p><p>In case you don't know me, I'm the author of a CRDT implementation named <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a>, that is specifically designed for building shared editing applications on the web.</p><p>In this article, I will introduce you to a simple optimization for CRDTs and examine the exact performance trade-off of using Yjs for shared editing. I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.</p><h2 id="yjs">Yjs</h2><p>Yjs is a framework for building collaborative applications using CRDTs as the data model. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions that enable shared editing using different editors (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-prosemirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror">ProseMirror</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remirror/extension-yjs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror">Remirror</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-quilljs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill">Quill</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/codemirror">CodeMirror</a>, ..), different networking technologies (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket">WebSocket</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-webrtc">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-hyper">Hyper</a>, ..), and different persistence layers (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-leveldb">LevelDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-redis">Redis</a>, ..). Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

Yjs is by far the fastest web-based CRDT implementation with the most efficient encoding. In this article I will often refer to specific benchmarks contained in the <code>crdt-benchmarks</code> repository as, for example, "<a href="https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks/#b1-no-conflicts">[B1.11]</a>".</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks"><div><p>dmonad/crdt-benchmarks</p><p>A collection of CRDT benchmarks.

If not, and you want to dive into this rabbit hole, I recommend this fun interactive series:</p><figure><a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/"><div><p>CRDTs: Part 1</p><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/profile.jpg"><span>Lars Hupel</span><span>Lars Hupel</span></p></div><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/topics/crdt/world.jpg"></p></a><figcaption>A fun interactive series about CRDTs</figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://crdt.tech/resources"><div><p>CRDT Resources • Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</p><p>Resources and community around CRDT technology — papers, blog posts, code and more.</p><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/favicons/favicon-192x192.png"><span>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</span></p></div><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/img/crdt-favicon.png"></p></a><figcaption>Good entry point to find more CRDT related resources</figcaption></figure><p>The concept paper that describes Yjs' conflict resolution algorithm YATA is available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types">Researchgate</a>. The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {
    id: { client: 1, clock: 0 },
    content: 'ABC',
    ...
}</code></pre><figcaption>Yjs's internal representation of items in the linked list</figcaption></figure><p>If a user copy/pastes a lot of content into the document, the inserted content is represented by a single <code>Item</code>. Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<h2>Or, Why is Mediterranean Maritime Sovereignty So Complicated?</h2>



<p>The Mediterranean Sea could almost be considered an inland body of water, except for a small connection to the Atlantic Ocean (only 16 km or 10 miles) between the coasts of Spain and Morocco at the Strait of Gibraltar. The waters of the Mediterranean can be further divided into the Alboran, Libyan, Levantine, Aegean, Ionian, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, and Balearic Seas. Twenty-three separate States lay claim to the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, and many of these are overlapping or disputed leading to an incredibly complex picture of maritime sovereignty.</p>



<h2>The Established Boundaries</h2>



<p>There are, however, twenty-two established maritime boundaries between the various Mediterranean States. The oldest is between Cyprus and the UK on behalf of its Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) of Akrotiri and Dhekelia located in the south of the island. Both the land and maritime boundaries between the SBAs and Cyprus were established by the same agreement from which Cyprus gained its independence from the UK on 16 August 1960. The <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-united-kingdom-maritime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maritime boundary</a> extends in four separate parts from the various land boundary termini on the coast and delimits the UK’s claimed three nautical mile territorial sea and Cyprus’s 12. The UK ceded all exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claims to Cyprus.</p>

<p>The most recent (as of late July 2020) Mediterranean maritime boundary is between Greece and Italy, signed on 9 June 2020. This new agreement updates a 24 May 1977 Treaty, transforming the already-established 16 point maritime boundary into WGS-84 and confirming its application for the EEZ, in addition to the continental shelf (CS). The 2020 update left the tripoints, with Albania in the north and Libya in the south, undefined. The Italy–Greece boundary is arguably less interesting than the second most recent Mediterranean maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya (signed 27 November 2019). That will be covered in greater depth below.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="749" height="1024" src="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-749x1024.png" alt="A map depicting the maritime boundary between Greece and Italy." srcset="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-749x1024.png 749w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-219x300.png 219w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-44x60.png 44w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-768x1050.png 768w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-600x821.png 600w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01.png 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"><figcaption><em>Greece and Italy’s original 1977 maritime boundary was updated to WGS-84 in 2020.</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Surprise! Greece and Egypt signed a new EEZ boundary Agreement on Thursday, August 6. The details have not yet been released to the public, but both Turkey and Libya have already protested the new boundary.</p>



<p>The shortest established Mediterranean maritime boundary is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Slovenia</a> at 15 M and the longest is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-tunisia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Tunisia</a>, which runs for 528 M.</p>



<p>That leaves about 30 maritime boundaries to be established, some of which are currently being negotiated (Greece and Albania) and some of which have 300 plus years of dispute that will need to be resolved before maritime boundary delimitation can begin (Spain and the UK on behalf of Gibraltar).</p>



<h2>Disputed Maritime Space</h2>



<p>When looking at disputed maritime areas in the Mediterranean, Turkey is the shadow over all of the eastern Sea. Its role in the Cyprus–Northern Cyprus conflict as well as the full extent of maritime disputes with Greece will be discussed in greater detail below. This section is to delve into Turkey’s full set of unilateral maritime claims which were updated in 2019.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png" alt="Map showing Turkey's unilateral maritime claim, overlaid with established maritime boundaries and provisional equidistance lines from Sovereign Limits." srcset="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-300x169.png 300w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-60x34.png 60w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-768x432.png 768w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1536x865.png 1536w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-2048x1153.png 2048w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>This map depicting extensions of Turkey’s EEZ claims was released by a Turkish diplomat in December 2019 (the map source and more information is from this <a href="https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/map-delineates-turkeys-maritime-frontiers-in-med-sea-149379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>). To capture the complicated nature of all of the other claims and established maritime boundaries, we’ve overlaid Sovereign Limits maritime data over top.</em> Between points A and B is the established maritime boundary with Northern Cyprus and between points E and F the new line with Libya.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Additionally, on 27 November 2019, Turkey and the UN-backed government of Libya (Libya is in the midst of a civil war, so yes, there are two entirely separate governments) signed a short, two-point maritime boundary agreement that dangles in the middle of Greek-claimed sea. This new boundary enraged neighboring Greece and Egypt as well as the entire EU. Its location deviates from the equidistance default stipulated by UNCLOS. Turkey and Libya note that the bilaterally negotiated boundary has nothing to do with third states, but as Greece claims the waters surrounding this new delimitation, it has caused quite a stir. The new August 2020 Egypt–Greece maritime boundary likely overlaps with the Libya–Turkey boundary in some capacity.</p>



<p>The conflict between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus would not have reached its modern outcome without Turkish involvement. Disagreements between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots on the island of Cyprus have been ongoing since even before Ottoman control of the island, and the modern conflict began shortly after independence from the United Kingdom. Turkey moved to occupy northern Cyprus in 1974 and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared independence in 1983. Today, Turkey is the only country who recognizes Northern Cyprus’s statehood.</p>



<p>The island of Cyprus is now divided by a UN mandated and monitored buffer zone that snakes its way through hilly territory and divides the capital city (for both Cypruses) of Nicosia. The southern Greek Republic of Cyprus is an EU member and is recognized by the UN as the sole sovereign power of the island.</p>



<p>Related to the Cyprus dispute, the maritime picture off the coast of the island is quite complicated. The Republic of Cyprus has established maritime boundaries with <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-egypt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-israel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel</a>, and <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lebanon</a>, in addition to the short UK boundaries already mentioned. Northern Cyprus agreed to a maritime boundary with Turkey, that the southern Republic of Cyprus disputes. Due to the nature of the dispute, the maritime boundaries between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus are also unresolved (and unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future).</p>



<p>Turning to the maritime disputes between Turkey and neighboring Greece offers an even more complicated picture (at least delimitation wise) due to the multitude of Greek Islands that lay just off the Turkish coast. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been historically complicated and often quite problematic, negativity driven by both the conflict in Cyprus and unresolved maritime issues in the Aegean Sea. Oil was discovered in the continental shelf in 1973, adding [literal] fuel to the fire.</p>

Turkey’s proposed maritime boundary lies to the west of equidistance.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Greece and Turkey have two extremely different perspectives on the possible delimitations of the maritime boundary through the Aegean Sea. Turkey is not a signatory of UNCLOS and claims that Greece’s Aegean Islands are not entitled to full continental shelf claims and would seek to have a mainland coast equidistance boundary through the middle of the Aegean Sea, while enclaving the Greek islands on the Turkish side of the maritime boundary line. Greece, a signatory of UNCLOS, meanwhile proposes a strict equidistance-based maritime boundary utilizing all of its islands, pushing the maritime boundary far to the east, just off the Turkish coast. Turkey’s position on the Greek claim is that this would create a “Greek Lake” of the Aegean Sea and severely limit Turkey’s freedom of navigation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.</p>



<p>There is also at least one officially disputed island between Turkey and Greece known as Imia by the Greeks and Kardak by the Turks. Turkish claims to additional islands have been made and redacted over the years.</p>



<p>Conflict over Greek and Turkish maritime claims is common. During the summer of 2020, Turkey has been conducting seismic surveys in Greek-claimed waters. And Greece is working on increasing its military power in response to Turkish aggression. Meanwhile, diplomats from the two states also sat down for a round of negotiations. In August, Greece called for talks to continue or a referral of the dispute to the ICJ.

<p>Looking beyond Turkey-centered disputes, there is a handful of interesting and impossible to resolve conflicts that speckle the entire Mediterranean Sea and neighboring bodies of water. Israel and Lebanon seem to be constantly in conflict over both their unresolved <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/israel-lebanon-land" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">land boundary</a> and maritime frontier. Natural gas reserves have been discovered in maritime space that both states claim, and in 2018 Lebanon auctioned off several disputed oil blocks. Israel is currently working on its own oil exploration in the disputed area.</p>



<p>The Palestinian territory of Gaza set forth maritime claims in 2015 and 2019 in which they proposed lateral boundaries with Egypt and Israel, creating a corridor of Palestinian maritime space before reaching the boundary with Cyprus. Both Israel and Egypt have submitted protests to the UN over Palestine’s unilateral maritime claims.</p>

<p>The former Yugoslav States of Croatia and Slovenia also have disputed maritime space in the northern Adriatic Sea despite a <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/croatia-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 Permanent Court of Arbitration Award</a> delimiting the boundary (Croatia had unilaterally withdrawn from the case in 2015 following a scandal). Slovenia accepts the Tribunal’s delimitation, but Croatia does not.</p>



<p>Some similarities can be drawn to the maritime boundary between Greece and Albania in the southern reaches of the Adriatic Sea. The two States signed a maritime boundary agreement in 2009, but this document was annulled shortly thereafter by Albania. Negotiations over the maritime boundary began again in 2018 and are ongoing. And with Greece’s current dedication to maritime boundary delimitation with its neighbors it is plausible that a new Greece–Albania maritime boundary Agreement …</p></div></div>

    <p><img alt="" src="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/atari-st-web.jpg" width="640"></p>

<hr><p>In the following tutorial, I’ll describe how I connected my Atari ST to the Internet via using a cheap ESP8266 microcontroller as a WiFi-to-serial router – running at 19.2 kbit/s. Note that there are faster solutions for network connectivity for the Atari, such as NetUSBee or CosmosEx. However, the setup I describe here is about as low-cost as it can get. You’ll probably have to spend less than 10 USD for the hardware.</p>

<p>Also note that Internet on the Atari is of limited use; don’t expect to be able to surf modern websites with your ST. Simpler services such as chatting via IRC (Internet Relay Chat) or file downloads via FTP are possible, however.</p>

<hr><h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p> I shall not be held responsible for any damage to your hardware or data for or other issues caused by this tutorial. Also, while I will try to answer your questions, please don’t expect me to provide professional support for everything described here. Please see below for alternative ways to get help.</p>

<hr><h3>Building the hardware</h3>

<p>The core component is the ESP8266 microcontroller from <a href="http://espressif.com/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview">Espressif</a> with WiFi connectivity. I use it on an ESP-01 board, but any other board with this microcontroller will do just as well. Furthermore, you’ll need a level shifter such as a MAX3232 for the RS-232 serial port and a 3.3 V power supply. I wired everything according to this schematic:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1041/schematic.png" width="674"></p>

<p>At least temporarily you’ll also need a serial cable for your PC (e.g. a USB-to-serial adapter) with 3.3(!) V logic levels to flash the firmware.</p>

<hr><h3>Flashing the firmware</h3>

<p>The ESP8266 will act as a WiFi-to-serial router running the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_slip_router">esp_slip_router firmware by Martin Ger</a>. I had to modify the firmware a little bit, for example to set the default serial bit rate to 19.2 kbit/s and to make this bit rate configurable. (In the meantime, the command to configure the bit rate has been added to Martin's original firmware as well.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/firmware-bitrate.zip">Download the modified firmware here</a> and flash it using your preferred ESP8266 flash tool. For my ESP-01 board I used <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool">esptool</a> and the following command – you’ll have to adapt <code>com8</code> to the serial port you want to use for flashing:</p>

<p><code>esptool.py --port com8 write_flash -ff 40m -fm dio -fs 8m 0x0 0x00000.bin 0x10000 0x10000.bin</code></p>

<p>In case your ESP8266 has never been flashed with <em>any </em>firmware before, you also need to flash the file&nbsp;<code>esp_init_data_default.bin</code>, which <a href="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/esp_init_data_default.bin">you can download here</a>. Symptoms of missing <em>init data</em> can be endless reboot loops of the ESP8266 and possibly wildly flashing LEDs on the module. The correct address depends on the size of the flash chip. <a href="https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/en/flash/#sdk-init-data">You can read more details here.</a> Then use the flash software such as esptool again, substituting the correct address and serial port for your module:</p>

<p><code>esptool.py --port com8 write_flash -ff 40m -fm dio -fs 8m <em>address</em> esp_init_data_default.bin</code></p>

<hr><h3>Getting and configuring the software</h3>

<p>The setup of SLIP serial link on the Atari ST is not plug-and-play, in fact it was the thing I spent most time on. So you can now <a href="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/software-atari.zip">download a software package</a> that I pre-configured for you, containing the STinG network stack for your Atari. The download will even fit on a 720k floppy disk. If you want to run it from harddisk – which I recommend – you’ll have to use a text editor to change the drive letter in <code>AUTO\STING.INF</code> and <code>CONTROL.INF</code>.</p>

<p>As it is usual on Atari TOS, you need to restore the correct order of the programs in the AUTO folder. In order to do this, first move <code>DRVIN.PRG</code> from the <code>AUTO.TMP</code> folder to the <code>AUTO</code> folder, then move <code>MFP.PRG</code> into the <code>AUTO</code> folder and finally move <code>STING.PRG</code> into the <code>AUTO</code> folder.</p>

<p>After booting from the floppy (or your harddisk), STinG will be installed. However, you still have to configure the WiFi-to-serial router to use your WiFi credentials. To do so, start TELNET.PRG and open a connection to host <em>192.168.240.1</em> and port <em>7777</em>. You will get a <code>CMD&gt;</code> prompt. Use the <code>set ssid</code> and <code>set password</code> commands to enter the login data to your WiFi, then enter the <code>save</code> and <code>reset</code> commands to store the configuration and restart the firmware. The connection will be lost after the reset command. Open a new connection to the same host and port number. The <code>show</code> command should then display that the module is connected to your WiFi. If it isn’t, double-check the login data. You can also use the <code>scan</code> command to see if your WiFi is visible to the ESP8266. Make a note of the DNS server shown.</p>

<p>See below for <a href="#bitrate">instructions to configure the serial bit rate</a> used by the firmware. Be sure to read the warning there as well.</p>

<p>See the following screenshot for an examplary configuration session. Note that you will obviously get different values for the IP address and the DNS server.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/telnet_configuration.png" width="640"></p>

<p>From the desktop accessory menu, select <em>Control Panel</em>, then <em>STinG Protocols</em> and <em>Resolver</em>. Enter the DNS server that was previously displayed to you into the <em>Name Server</em> field. Don’t forget to click <em>Save</em>. See this screenshot for an example:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/dns_configuration.png" width="273"></p>

<hr><h3>Now what?</h3>

<p>Your Internet connection is configured now and can be used with any program that supports the STinG or STiK network stacks. Apart from the Telnet client, I’ve also included an IRC (chat) client and the web browser CAB. However, please note that the versions of CAB and CAB.OVL are terribly outdated and are only included as a proof-of-concept. You can also find several suitable FTP and e-mail clients for the Atari, such as <a href="http://www.atack.cz/atari/">aFTP and aMail</a>.</p>

<hr><h3><a id="bitrate" name="bitrate"></a>Increasing the connection speed</h3>

<p>The default bit rate of the firmware is 19.2 kbit/s, the maximum speed that the MFP (serial controller) in the Atari ST is capable of without any hardware modification. However, more advanced Atari computers – such as the MegaSTE, TT or Falcon – can use higher bit rates on the serial port if the proper <a href="http://atariftp.czietz.de/pub/atari/Modem/hsmoda07.zip">HSMODEM serial driver</a> is used. Hence, I modified the firmware to allow you to configure the bit rate. To do so, use <code>TELNET.PRG</code> to connect to <em>192.168.240.1</em>, port <em>7777 </em>(same as above). At the <code>CMD&gt;</code> prompt enter the <code>set bitrate</code> command, e.g. <code>set bitrate 57600</code>, then enter the <code>save</code> command. After the next power-up of the ESP8266 or after a <code>reset</code> command, the firmware will use the new bit rate.</p>

<p>In the desktop accessories menu, select <em>Control Panel</em>, then <em>Serial Ports</em> and change the bit rate of STinG accordingly. Don't forget to click <em>Save</em>.</p>

<p> Be aware that the firmware will accept any bit rate. If you set a bit rate not supported by your computer, you will not be able to use <code>TELNET.PRG</code> to change it again. If the module is still connected to your WiFi and you know its IP address (shown as <em>External IP</em> with the <code>show</code> command) you can <em>telnet </em>to this IP and port <em>7777</em> from another computer in your WiFi to change the configuration. Otherwise, you will have to erase the flash of the ESP board, e.g. with esptool, and then reflash the firmware to revert to 19.2 kbit/s. So, be sure to double check the bit rate before you enter the <code>save</code> command.</p>

<hr><h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, the connection speed is limited by capabilities of the ST’s serial port. Furthermore, the WiFi-to-serial router does network address translation for outgoing connections only. Incoming connections will not work. This means that you cannot run a server on your Atari and that FTP file transfers will only work in the passive mode.</p>

<hr><h3>Questions?</h3>

<p>I very much prefer if you ask your questions in <a href="http://atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=31586">this Atari Forum thread</a> because then others can benefit from the answers. Also, please don’t expect me to reply immediately, this is only a hobby project of mine.</p>

<h3>Break someone’s code today!</h3><p>On September 1st of 2000 Damian Conway sent a proposal №188, promoting the idea of Private Keys and Methods.</p><p>In those days, Perl’s object-oriented programming relied heavily on hashes. Indeed, a hash can store data values by keys, as well as  references to routines, which is how you can describe an object with data attributes and methods. With bits of syntax sugar here and there one can make shortcuts to work with such an object’s state and behavior.</p><p>So can be done in Raku nowadays:</p><pre id="advent-code-fdb55dec-8cdf-4465-89e6-a64a01297843"><table>

It gives you means to divide your coding efforts into a couple of different realms, one of which has “Nobody but I can use this” policy and its opposite takes the famous “Use it as you please and we will try really, really hard not to break anything knowingly” stance.</p><p>While encapsulation by itself is not a Great Code Problems Solver (you can write scary code anyways!) nor it reduces the amount of bugs (as if it happens!), but it certainly can save you some nerves during rewriting code (which sometimes is a Great Way To Solve Problems) and reduces coupling between components (which does reduce the amount of bugs, right? Hope never dies).</p><p>Here, inspired by the <code>Tie::SecureHash</code> module approach, Damian Conway has proposed a way to support encapsulation in a hash-based object-y system.</p><h3>Sugar – the keyword way</h3><p>The proposal describes a unary function named <code>private</code>, which can be applied to a single hash entry, a slice of entries or a whole hash:</p><pre id="advent-code-922ff4d7-0f96-4ebf-b620-d3383d9fe9e7"><table>

<h3>Conclusion: Huffmanize it!</h3>

<p>Raku wisdom says “Huffmanize your syntax”, as mighty Huffman coding it tells you to make things which are common to type easier to type.</p><p>With the Raku object system being ground up overhauled, the question of encapsulation was not forgotten! Not! In! A! Bit! (sorry for all the line noise you just heard).</p>

<p>Private things in Raku are marked with an exclamation mark. Firstly, it indicates to the reader those code bits are important. Secondly, for attributes it serves as a secondary “sigil”, namely “twigil”, which tells the reader that some interesting scoping is involved here. Thirdly, it looks like it has some class. Fourthly… Do you really expect more reasons here? Please, come up with your ideas in the comments!</p><p>Using Raku for some years, it suddenly strikes with a simple consistency here:</p><pre id="advent-code-e041a903-314f-48ac-a379-d7ea49cce3f1"><table>

          <p>Languages are often judged initially on their "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">Hello,
world!</a>" program.
How easy is it to write? To run? How easy is it to understand? It's a very
simple program, of course, one of the simplest, even... just produce a little
text, and display it, what could be simpler?</p>
<p>It's really not fair to judge a language by such a cursory impression, but it
<em>can</em> give you an idea of what a language <em>values</em> and how it works. What does
the syntax look like? Is it typed? Is it interpreted? You can usually tell a
lot at a glance.</p>
<p>For example, One of Ruby's (many) hello worlds is so simple, it's also Python!</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>'Hello world!'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Often, people coming from interpreted languages experience compiled, systems
languages to be more complicated right off the bat. There is the obvious added
complexity of compiling and running being separate steps, as opposed to simply
pointing an executable at some source code and seeing a result right away, but
there are often syntactical constructs to go along with that...</p>
<p>At first glance, Rust's hello world looks fairly inert, as well:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
    <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>println!</code> is actually a macro, what does it look like expanded?</p>
<pre><code><span>macro_rules!</span> println {
    () =&gt; ($crate::<span>print!</span>(<span>"\n"</span>));
    ($($arg:tt)*) =&gt; ({
        $crate::io::_print($crate::format_args_nl!($($arg)*));
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that this <em>also</em> has a macro <em>inside of it.</em> This matches on the
second case (because there is an argument present) and calls into
<code>$crate::format_args_nl!</code> and passes the result of that to <code>$crate::io::_print</code></p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>_print</span></span>(args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;) {
    print_to(args, &amp;LOCAL_STDOUT, stdout, <span>"stdout"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>which calls into <code>print_to</code>, which looks like</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>print_to</span></span>&lt;T&gt;(
    args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;,
    local_s: &amp;<span>'static</span> LocalKey&lt;RefCell&lt;<span>Option</span>&lt;<span>Box</span>&lt;<span>dyn</span> Write + <span>Send</span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,
    global_s: <span><span>fn</span></span>() -&gt; T,
    label: &amp;<span>str</span>,
) <span>where</span>
    T: Write,
{
    <span>let</span> result = local_s
        .try_with(|s| {
            
            
            
            <span>let</span> prev = s.borrow_mut().take();
            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(<span>mut</span> w) = prev {
                <span>let</span> result = w.write_fmt(args);
                *s.borrow_mut() = <span>Some</span>(w);
                <span>return</span> result;
            }
            global_s().write_fmt(args)
        })
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| global_s().write_fmt(args));

    <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Err</span>(e) = result {
        <span>panic!</span>(<span>"failed printing to {}: {}"</span>, label, e);
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Which is, uh, well let's just say it's not exactly <em>simple</em> looking now? There
is a lot going on here!</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not faulting Rust here at all, my point is exactly the
opposite actually, in that there is <em>always</em> necessarily more going on in a
"Hello world!" than <code>puts "la de da"</code> or similar would have you believe on its
face. Speaking of Ruby's <code>puts</code>, what <em>is</em> the code that runs <code>puts</code> in the
Ruby interpreter itself, which is written in C?</p>
<p>Well it looks like <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/7c2bbd1c7d40a30583844d649045824161772e36/io.c#L7727-L7758">this</a></p>

<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>We all know that a languages like Ruby or Python are designed explicitly to
hide this sort of complexity from us and let us get on with the dirty business
of munging data blobs or serving web requests or solving sudokus or whatever,
and thank goodness for that, but wow that is <em>quite</em> a lot, isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<p>When people come from languages that were designed to be ergonomic to more
systems oriented languages, they're often jarred by what they perceive to be
code thatis inelegant, ugly, and verbose. To be sure, it sometimes <em>is</em> exactly
that... (although anyone who has worked with a "pretty" language in a production
codebase knows that those are not immune to these descriptors either).</p>
<p>Usually, the tradeoff is explicit: elegance and simplicity for
<em>control</em>...  specific and granular <em>control</em>, over the program that will
eventually be run.  It isn't always necessary, in fact it is almost always _un_necessary,
to have <em>that</em> much control over your program. Obviously, productivity matters,
and if your business is <em><em>insert viable business</em></em>, well it's likely that your
goals are not going to be optimally met by futzing with manual memory
management all day (<a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/">at least from the macro level, in the general
sense</a>).</p>
<p>But what if you <em>do</em> need that control? Well then, <em>you need it</em>. When every
ounce of performance actually is necessary, or on embedded systems with hard
memory constraints, or when writing code for some bespoke or otherwise uncommon
processor.</p>
<p>I'm going to choose one language, Zig, and dive deep into its hello world, but
it is important to note here that my point is not primarily about Zig, it's
about how <em>all</em> languages have to contend with an enormous amount of complexity
in order to do <em>anything</em>, even the simplest of tasks like a hello world
program. Complexity that is, for the most part, hidden from us in our day to
day. So what in the hello world is <em>actually</em> going on then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll be using the most current minor release version of Zig: 0.6.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Let's take a walk</h2>
<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>'s hello world looks like this, from the docs.:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
    <span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
    <span>try</span> stdout.print(<span>"Hello, {}!\n"</span>, .{<span>"world"</span>});
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you are new to zig, a quick word on this syntax before I get into the gritty
details.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><code>@import</code> is a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Builtin-Functions"><em>compiler
builtin</em></a> function
that assigns the namespace of the file it is referencing to the <code>const</code>
variable on the left hand side.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
  
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just like in C, <code>main</code> is a special function that marks the entry point to a
program after it has been compiled as an executable. Unlike in C, it accepts no
arguments (C's main function has a variety of vagaries that make it a bit
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4207223">unique</a>) and command line input is
available through utility functions to allow easier cross platform use.</p>
<p>It is marked <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Keyword-pub"><code>pub</code></a> so
that it is accessible from outside of the immediate module ('module' here
referring to nothing more than the top level scope of the current namespace...
i.e., the file), this is a necessary step since, as the program's entry point,
<code>main</code> would <em>have</em> to be accessible from outside the immediate scope.</p>
<p><code>fn</code> is the function keyword.</p>
<p><code>main()</code> is the name of the function (and where the argument list <em>would</em> be)
and <code>!void</code> is the return type. Looking a little closer at that return type:</p>
<p>In C, the return type of a function is declared <em>before</em> anything else. This
makes a certain amount of sense: it's congruent with how variables are
declared, after all, and scanning the file you can see clearly "calling this
will get you that."</p>
<p>In Zig, the return type comes after the function declaration but before the
function body. This also makes sense! It's the same in Rust and Go, and seems
to be generally a more modern approach. The reason is actually pretty simple:
doing it this way makes it possible to have a context-free grammar! C and C++
put the parser in a position where it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">has to understand semantics to even just
<em>parse</em> the source
code.</a></p>
<p>In Zig, <code>main</code> returns <code>void</code> (well, actually, it can return a variety of
things, and if it returns void (which is just a way of saying it doesn't return
anything at all)), it's actually returning
<a href="https://github.com/jfo/zig/blob/7381aaf70e0cad92fc52b79f3aa2a0abb7c3ee04/lib/std/start.zig#L241-L244"><code>0</code></a>
as a success code, but) there is a wrinkle!  <code>void</code> is preceded by an
exclamation mark. This means: "This function is supposed to return <code>void</code>, but
it <em>could</em> fail and return an error." This is an <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Inferred-Error-Sets">inferred error
set</a>, and
whenever a function that <em>could</em> fail is called, the compiler will enforce that
you handle that error at the call site. More on Zig's error handling some other
time, for now it is enough to understand what the <code>!</code> in front of the return
type declaration means. I want to move on to the body of the function, let's go
line by line.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
</code></pre>
<p>So, we can see that this is a call into a standard library function (<code>std</code>)
that returns something that we assign to <code>const stdout</code>. Standard out (stdout) and
standard error (stderr) may be familiar concepts from the shell, but what does it
mean to be referring to <code>stdout</code> here in this program? What exactly <em>is</em>
<code>stdout</code>? Whatever it is, it's being returned by the call to <code>outStream()</code>,
which is a method called on the return value of <code>std.io.getStdOut()</code>, so we
first need to know what <em>that</em> is.</p>
<p>To the source! In the Zig source tree, <code>std</code> lives in <code>lib/std/std.zig</code>, which
is a file that makes a wide variety of functionality available. It includes the line:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> io = <span>@import</span>(<span>"io.zig"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Which is referred to on the <code>std</code> variable as <code>std.io</code> (again, notice the <code>pub</code>
keyword, without which this declared constant would be inaccesible outside of
this immediate scope). Going deeper, into <code>lib/std/io.zig</code>...</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>getStdOut</span></span>() File {
    <span>return</span> File{
        .handle = getStdOutHandle(),
        .capable_io_mode = .blocking,
        .intended_io_mode = default_mode,
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>stdout</code> is a <em>File</em> struct. Let's look at that. It is imported at the top
of <code>io.zig</code> as</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> File = std.fs.File;
</code></pre>
<p>and lives in the source, perhaps unsurprisingly, at <code>lib/std/fs/File.zig</code>. This
struct definition is quite long, so I'll focus on what we want to look at, the
<code>outStream()</code> method.</p>
<h2>An aside: methods vs functions</h2>
<p>Zig doesn't <em>really</em> have methods, but it's useful to talk about a special
class of functions <em>as</em> methods, since the calling convention supports implicit
passing of <code>self</code> when called on a struct "instance" using dot syntax. Let me
show you what I mean.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>con…</span></code></pre></div></div>

</p><hr>
<p>A lot of my Google searches are specific and require lots of typing, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This searches for "realloc" on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference.com</a> and <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a>.
To reduce the amount of typing, I built a command line tool that allows me to
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)">macros</a> that expand into larger phrases. E.g. I can write</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{cpp} realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instead of writing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this week's post, I'll show you how I built this tool. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> modules to parse macros from a text file.</li>
<li>How to construct a Google search URL using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html">urllib.parse</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>

</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I could copy-and-paste these URLs into my browser. But, since I use macOS, I
create a <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Functions">shell function</a> that uses the <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/open.html">open</a> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ gg() { open "$(./search-google "$@")" ; }
$ gg {movie} alien 1979
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>(Opens URL in my browser.)
</code></pre>

<p>I place the macro file in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">home directory</a> using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.home">pathlib.Path.home</a>.</p>
<p>I read from the macro file using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_text">pathlib.Path.read_text</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.finditer">re.finditer</a>.
I use a regular expression to extract the macros from the macro file, and I use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip">str.strip</a> to remove excess whitespace from the macros.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format_map">str.format_map</a> to perform the macro substitutions.</p>
<p>Instead of performing substitutions until I hit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)">fixed point</a>, I perform a
finite number of substitutions.
(This is the constant <code>MAX_MACRO_SUBSTITIONS</code>.)
I do this because it is an easy way to prevent unbounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>, and, in
practice, my macros are not complex enough to cause this strategy to fail.</p>
<p>A macro substitution will fail if I reference a macro that doesn't exist, e.g.
<code>{xyxhkj}</code>.
I handle this by using the context manager <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress">contextlib.suppress</a>.
This allows me to catch the relevant exception and stop performing
substitutions, without terminating the whole program.</p>
<p>I build the URL by combining a constant prefix,
<code>https://www.google.com/search?q=</code>, with the query string.
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.quote_plus">urllib.parse.quote_plus</a> to properly escape the query string. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>import urllib.parse
query = "site:news.ycombinator.com haskell"
print(query)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site:news.ycombinator.com haskell
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print(urllib.parse.quote_plus(query))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+haskell
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to build a command line tool that helps
you search Google.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> modules to parse the macros.
And you used the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html">urllib.parse</a> module to properly construct the URL.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read about the different Google search operators. (<a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">"Refine web searches" via
google.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Create a few macros that would be useful to you. Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a macro that restricts searches to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby-lang.org</a>.</li>
<li>Create a macro that searches for upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run">5K races</a> in a specified city.</li>
<li>CreateÂ&nbsp;a macro that searches a person's name, but excludes results from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</li>
</ul>

Erdős, who is well-known for his contributions to number theory, set theory, probability theory, graph theory, and more, as well as the invention of the Erdős Number, a measure of one's proximity to having collaborated with him, is of course a subject himself. That said, in Hoffman's biography of him, there is a bit about the behavior of mathematicians and a lone physicist that does well to embody the spiritual and cognitive differences between the two groups, both of which share a passion for mathematical thinking but nevertheless are separable beasts.&nbsp;</p><p><span></span>The excerpt of interest tells of a mathematics conference in which a group of mathematicians return to the coffee table after a talk only to find a puzzle.</p><p><a name="more"></a><i>The rest filed out and raced toward a folding table that supported two large brown plastic tanks, one labeled WITH CAFFEINE, the other WITHOUT CAFFEINE. The mathematicians had already tanked up once, before the graph theo- rist's talk, and now the labels on the tanks were curiously switched. The mathematicians were in a tizzy and stared, puzzled, at the tanks. Their collective brainpower, fine for discerning the latest wrinkles in infinite graph theory, was stalling out on the case of the true Joe.</i></p><p><i>Finally a lightbulb went off in the head of a jovial, beer-bellied fellow in a JOY OF SETS T-shirt. He stepped forward and filled his Styrofoam cup, half from one tank and half from the other.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>"I see," laughed one of his compatriots, "the game-theoretic solution!"</i></p><p><i>"I have another solution," said a thin man whose hands trembled slightly, apparently from a caffeine high. He&nbsp;</i><i>filled his cup a quarter full from one of the tanks.&nbsp;</i><i>"This is the asymptotic solution," he announced. "I'm already so wired I only want a little bit more; whatever is in the cup, I win."</i></p><p><i>A bystander who was a physicist rather than a mathematician didn't understand the need for all this sophisticated thinking. He pointed out that one tank was bigger than the other, and that the bigger tank presumably held caffeinated coffee since more people drink it than drink decaf. &nbsp;The mathematicians were taken aback by the simplicity of the solution. "Our different approaches," said the physicist, "remind me of an old joke. A physicist and a mathematician are flying cross-country together. Each is keeping a diary of the trip. They fly over a white horse in Iowa. The physicist writes, 'There is a white horse in Iowa.' The mathematician writes, 'There exists, somewhere in the Midwest, a horse, white on top.'"</i></p><p>For all that has been written about the difference between physicists and mathematicians, especially with the goal of illuminating their inner minds, this passage provides both a reasonable illustration and a good laugh.</p><p><b><a href="http://twitter.com/philliplevin"> Did you enjoy this?
