<p>If multiple -m options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs</p>

<div>
<p>… or it took a while to get here 😀</p>
<h4>Origins</h4>
<p>This project is fully lead by Willy/Lamers with my minor participation.</p>
<p>It all started with an idea to create the most convenient modern USB mouse adapter for as many retro machines as possible.</p>
<p>Willy started working on it in his spare-time six years ago. The project goals were simple.</p>
<ul><li>small, smooth and not expensive design</li><li>reliable</li><li>quadrature encoder mouse support</li><li>easy to use and maintain</li><li>easy to personalize/configure</li><li>quick firmware upgrade</li></ul>
<p>The project came about quite quickly and Willy ordered the first batch. Unfortunately, It met almost all conditions but one – reliability. The design was based on the FTDI Vinculum2 chip. Although the layout is not bad, the toolchain is terribly underdeveloped (at least it was at that time). There were memory leaks all over the place, debugging was almost impossible, mainly due to the processor for which there is no documentation. In addition, the configuration saved from time to time destroyed the config itself …<br>It was too much. The project has been abandoned. If you are a strong-willed person you can try it yourself. All work that was done on it, is accessible <a href="http://jil.guru/16bit/projects/abbannddonnedd/hid2st.rar">HERE</a>. You can view or use it if you have the energy to break through the unfinished, wrong and undocumented code</p>
<h4>The new hope</h4>
<p>In the meantime, the design was repeatedly unearthed from a drawer, but unfortunately without much effect. Some of the original goals turned out to be impossible to fulfill.</p>
<p>Up to <a href="http://sillyventure.eu/pl/">Silly Venture 2019</a> which turned out to be a breakthrough. the demand for a functional Atari ST adapter turned out to be quite large. The mouSTer project was born.</p>
<p>The project received a new name “The mouSTer” and <a href="http://www.ha.art.pl/wydawnictwo/autorzy/5334-piotr-kroll-mietniowski.html">Kroll</a> (translator required) became its godfather. I hope he doesn’t mind :). Kroll is the best tester of an Atari equipment around.</p>
<p>The project has gained a new shape and new strengths.</p>
<p>Some early prototype pics:</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/j2aoKg8.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/j2aoKg8.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>At the moment, the current size has been reduced to a minimum – DB9 plug size + USB-A socket</p>
<p>Below some highlights:</p>
<ul><li>it works with every mouse and with every Game USB pad</li><li>PS4 pad support – USB </li><li>config via USB flash drive – INI file + default config</li><li>config transfer via USB flash drive</li><li>firmware upgrade via USB flash drive (takes 3 seconds, of which 2 seconds is the time the bootloader needs to recognize the flash drive)</li><li>tested with flash drives from 32MB to 32GB</li><li>mouse emulation mode defaults – Amiga, Atari ST, joystick/gamepad</li></ul>
<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>Finally, after a few months of testing in laboratory conditions, everything works rock-solid. Changing the firmware and configuration works confidently and is trouble-free.</p>

<p><br>What’s left to be done<mark id="annotation-text-c72ef339-eeed-462d-a5c9-61b4fb1fb90d"></mark>:</p>
<ul><li>making a test batch in the target size – closing the plant due to COVID19 did not help at all 🙁</li><li>configuration file tuning</li><li>creating a poly-urethane case</li><li>adding config options for Commodore 64/128, Spectrum, and every other possible retro machine.</li><li>PS4 pad full support for all platforms.</li><li>8-bit Atari will receive a special mode that will cover all the PS4 pad functions, mouse and other HID class devices</li><li>testing, testing, testing …</li></ul>
<p><strong>What has to be highlighted is that mouSTer started as an ATARI add-on but it aims to be multi-platform adapter!!</strong></p>

		<p>I have a confession to make: I can’t eat spicy food.</p>
<p>As a person of South Asian descent, it’s incongruous, I know. I’m left adrift with the certain type of person who orders food Indian spicy. While my dining companions make an effort to signal their identity as capsaicin-consuming, I wonder if I should order my food white-guy mild. It’s not like I don’t enjoy the stinging heat or the bleary-eyed trip of something made extra hot—it’s just that I can’t digest it.</p>

<p>I blame dysentery. A bout of it when I was three left two lasting effects on my life: it introduced me to my oldest friendship through a circuitous game of chance (a story for another time), and it rendered my digestive system subject to pains that feel like someone is reaching into me to wring out my guts like wet laundry.</p>
<p>I’m often told by well-meaning people how much they love Indian food, and then asked if I cook it at home. I never know quite how to respond. Does roti count—especially if it’s the buss-up shut <i>parāthā</i> of Trinidad? Where do Bihari staples like <i>sattū</i> (ground-up roasted gram) or <i>chōkha</i> (mashed and roasted eggplant) fit into this understanding? But their question isn’t an interrogation of the narrowness of national cuisines. Their question isn’t a question at all—it’s a chance to share. The woman who loves her corner Indian restaurant. The man who just took an Indian-cooking class through adult education. The reasons are usually the same: they love the heat, the fieriness, the spice.</p>
<p>All the things I’m doomed to avoid.</p>

<p>This all had me wondering: what’s Indian food without the heat? The historian in me has an answer: spiciness is historically contingent. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and the entire world changed: slavery, war, disease, colonization, and an immense transfer of wealth to Europe. And with that wealth too came New World nightshades—potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, peppers of all kinds. It took some time for these fruits and vegetables to plant themselves into European cuisine. The tomato, for example, wasn’t widely used in Italian cuisine until the eighteenth century.<span id="easy-footnote-1-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-69820" title="David Gentilecore, <i>Pomodoro! A History of the Tomato in Italy</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 45–68."><sup>1</sup></a></span> But what about food further out from Europe? What about India?</p>
<p>Soon after Columbus’ first expedition, the treaties of Tordesillas and Saragossa divided the oceans of the newly-known world. The Portuguese effectively took the Atlantic and Indian oceans, while the Spanish took the Pacific. With that, the Portuguese established forts and trading posts along India’s Malabar coast. In time, <i>aloo</i> (potato), <i>tamātar</i> (tomato), and <i>mirchī</i> (chilies) were available on the western coast of the Indian subcontinent. Later, the English set up their first trading posts in India in the eastern Gangetic plain, bringing these same staples into North India.<span id="easy-footnote-2-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-69820" title="K.T. Achaya, <i>Indian Food: A Historical Companion</i> (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998), 225–27."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>So what was curry like before Columbus? Well, <i>curry</i> didn’t exist.</p>
<p>In these cases, I find it useful to consult my <i>Hobson-Jobson</i>, the nineteenth-century dictionary of Anglo-Indian loan words. According to that source, curry comes from the Portuguese word <i>karil (caril)</i> via the Tamil word <i>kari</i> (sauce, relish for rice). In the sixteenth century, this was transliterated into English as caril, but by the 1680s entered English as <i>carrees</i>, perhaps from <i>caris</i>, an Anglicized plural form of the Portuguese.<span id="easy-footnote-3-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-69820" title="Sir Henry Yule, “Curry,” in <a href=&quot;https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/hobsonjobson_query.py?page=281&quot;><i>Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive</i></a>, ed. William Crooke, B.A (London: J Murray, 1903), 281."><sup>3</sup></a></span> It’s a circle: I’m back to Tordesillas and Saragossa.</p>
<p>It looks like the curry too came after Columbus. And not only that: it’s a meaningless word in the context of daily life. Indian food is cipher, built upon a matrix of regionalism, religion, and caste. A Dalit from Mararashtra’s Marathwada region might mix bovine blood with <i>yesur</i> (a local spice mix) to make <i>lakuti</i>, while a Tamil Brahmin might mix eight spices with <i>tur dāl</i> and onions to make a <i>sambar</i>.<span id="easy-footnote-4-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-69820" title="Shahu Patole, <a href=&quot;http://www.expressfoodie.com/main-course/why-i-wrote-a-book-on-dalit-food/&quot;>“Why I Wrote a Book on Dalit Food,”</a> <i>Express Foodie</i>, September 10, 2016."><sup>4</sup></a></span> Beyond the hyper-regionalism is a blunt truth as well: there are actual words for the plethora of regional dishes that can be reduced to a curry.</p>
<p>Still, curry can be a somewhat useful concept. It’s an outsider’s perspective, a shorthand glossing over an entire subcontinent’s worth of food. It’s the type of concept that takes what it wants from the original, and mixes in whatever else is ready-to-hand.</p>
<p>I went to the source: the first example of a curry recipe found in a Western cookbook. Hannah Glasse’s 1747 <i>The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</i> featured a recipe “To make a Currey the Indian way” alongside one “To make a Pellow the Indian way.”<span id="easy-footnote-5-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-69820" title="Hannah Glasse, <i>The Art of Cookery, New</i> (London: L. Wangford, 1777), 74."><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Upon first glance, I can’t tell how this recipe differs from a fricasseed chicken. But it’s there: “an ounce of Turmerick [turmeric], a large spoonful of ginger and beaten pepper.” What makes this curry in an Indian way is not the chicken or the cream, but these three spices taken mixed together and served.</p>
<p>Before spicy came spice: the history of curry before Columbus is a history of spice. And so I wonder: what spices were used? In what quantities?</p>
<p>The best spice to help answer these questions might be asafetida (also spelled asafetida). Known in Hindi as <i>hīng</i>, it’s the dried resin taken from the root of the Ferula herb, and is used throughout Indian cuisine in nearly all Indian regions. When fried in oil, it adds a lovely umami flavor to any dish, one reminiscent of garlic or onions.</p>
<p>I’ve also known it as an extremely smelly spice.</p>

<p>I had never heard of it until I was an adult. Family lore says that my father hated the smell so much, he told my mother early in their marriage to keep it out of the spice cabinet forever. But it wasn’t just him—the smell has a noxious reputation across the world, going back centuries. The Portuguese physician and naturalist Garcia de Orta wrote in his sixteenth-century <i>Colóquios</i> that “the nastiest smell in the world for me is Assa-fetida [sic].” But he also wrote that “the thing most used throughout India, and in all parts of it, is that Assa-fetida.”<span id="easy-footnote-6-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-69820" title="Garcia da Orta, <i>Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India</i>, ed. Conde de Ficalho, trans. Sir Clements Markham, New Lisbon Edition (London: Henry Sotheran and Co, 1913), 44–45."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This was as true in the twelfth century as it was in the sixteenth. One of the earliest South Asian texts that featured non-medicinal recipes was the Sanskrit <i>Mānasollāsa</i>. Written in 1129 CE by Someshvara III, king of the Western Chalukya Empire in the western Deccan and South India, the book is an encyclopedic treatise on all aspects of life in his kingdom. One of those most common ingredients found in its chapter on the enjoyment of food is asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-7-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-69820" title="Colleen Taylor Sen, <i>Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India</i>, Overdrive (eBook) edition (London: Reaktion Books, 2015), chap. 7."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
<p>For example, his general practices or preparing meat dishes called for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>For getting good smell, dry coriander seeds, jeera, and hingu; for giving colour haridra; for good taste the powder of saindhvam, visvamarichim are sprinkled over the food and covered with a clean cloth and mixed slightly with oil.<span id="easy-footnote-8-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-69820" title="P. Arundhati, trans., <i>Royal Life in Mānasôllāsa</i> (New Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan, 1994), 120."><sup>8</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Various other recipes, including those for <i>dāl</i>, meat dishes, and fish were also spiced with asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-9-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>9</sup></a></span> My first inclination when I saw this was to question it: of course a king would spice his food. Spices were a luxury, and it goes without saying that a king could afford to command his kitchen to use whatever spices were available to him.</p>

<p>But a century prior to the publication of the <i>Mānasollāsa</i> came the <i>Lokopakara</i> (roughly translates to “For the benefit of the people”). Written in 1025 by the Jain scholar Chavundaraya II, the<i> Lokopakara</i> featured a section on cooking with a recipe for <i>dāl </i>that recommended a garnish of mustard, cumin seeds, asafetida, and curry leaves.<span id="easy-footnote-10-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Asafetida too made an appearance in recipes dating from the Sultanate era. From 1206 to 1526, a succession of Islamic dynasties known as the Delhi Sultanate ruled northern India. Nasir ud-Din Shah, a ruler of the Malwa Sultanate (a breakaway state from one of the Delhi Sultanate dynasties) produced the <i>Ni’matnama</i> (“The Book of Delights”). The book contained some of the recipes loved by his father, the Sultan Ghiyath Shah. Interestingly enough, the book contains a handful of recipes considered rustic or common—food for the common folk.</p>
<p>One recommends to:</p>
<blockquote><p>take root vegetables and boil them well, then take them off and fry them in ghee flavoured with sesame and asafetida.</p>
<p>Add lime juice, salt and burned vegetable oil and mix it as explained above. Take some of it, flavor it and cook it.<span id="easy-footnote-11-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-69820" title="Norah M. Titley, ed., <i>The Ni’matnama Manuscript of the Sultans of Mandu: The Sultan’s Book of Delights</i> (London: Routledge, 2004), 44–45."><sup>11</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure how burned vegetable oil would taste, but I’m sure the asafetida would make up for it. Maybe.</p>
<p>Humble <i>hīng</i> too made an appearance in the royal accounts of the Mughals. The Mughal Emperor Akbar reigned from 1556 to 1605. His court historian, Abu’l-Fazl ‘Allami, dutifully chronicled his reign in <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> (“Administration of Akbar”). The work remains a quintessential source for the workings of Akbar’s government. It also contains a repertoire of recipes. For example, a recipe for <i>bādinjān</i> (eggplant) asks for:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 s. [<i>sīr</i>, approximately 640 grams] rice; 1 ½ s. g’hí [ghee], 3 ¾ s. onions; ¼ s. ginger and lime juice; pepper and coriander seed, 5 m. [misqal, approximately 6 grams] of each; cloves, cardamums [cardamom], and assafoetida, each ½ m.<span id="easy-footnote-12-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-69820" title="Abu’l-Fazl ’Allami, <i>The Ain I Akbari</i>, trans. Henry Blochmann, vol. 1 (Calcutta: Rouse, 1873), 59."><sup>12</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Strangely enough, the recipe for eggplant lacks any mention of eggplant. But regardless, there it is: a half <i>misqal</i> of asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-13-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-69820" title="A unit of mass equal to 4.25 grams. Misqal is sometimes written as mithqāl."><sup>13</sup></a></span> Even the kitchens of the Mughal court were filled with the wondrous odors of <i>hīng</i>.</p>
<p>The history of curry before Columbus is truly a history of spice. There are, of course, more spices to find in the archives: turmeric, coriander, and cumin come to mind. These are spices that cross region and class, the staples thrown into the pot in meal after meal. But ubiquitous, smelly, resinous <i>hīng</i> gives a chance to take a peek into the flavors of Indian food prior to the Columbian exchange. Perhaps there should be a new way to order something, not Indian spicy, but Indian spiced, with plenty of asafetida. I’ll hold my nose and ask for a generous portion, just like all those food chroniclers over the past millennium.</p>

July 7, 2020 | https://secret.club/2020/07/06/bottleye.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://secret.club/2020/07/06/bottleye.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The popular anti-cheat <a href="https://battleye.com/">BattlEye</a> is widely used by modern online games such as <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape from Tarkov</a> and is considered an industry standard anti-cheat by many. In this article I will demonstrate a method I have been utilizing for the past year, which enables you to play any BattlEye-protected game online without even having to install BattlEye.</p><p>BattlEye is dynamically loaded by the respective game on startup to initialize the software service (“BEService”) and kernel driver (“BEDaisy”). These two components are critical in ensuring the integrity of the game, but the most critical component by far is the usermode library (“BEClient”) that the game interacts with directly. This module exports two functions: <code>GetVer</code> and more importantly <code>Init</code>.</p><p>The <em>Init</em> routine is what the game will call, but this functionality has never been documented before, as people mostly focus on BEDaisy or their <a href="https://secret.club/tags#battleye">shellcode</a>. Most important routines in <em>BEClient</em>, including <em>Init</em>, are protected and virtualised by <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/">VMProtect</a>, which we are able to devirtualise and reverse engineer thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vtil-project">vtil</a> by secret club member <a href="https://secret.club/author/can1357">Can Boluk</a>, but the inner workings of <em>BEClient</em> is a topic for a later part of this series, so here is a quick summary.</p><p><em>Init</em> and its arguments have the following definitions:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,

    remove_peer_t remove_peer;
};
</code></pre><p>As seen, these are quite simple containers for interopability between the game and <em>BEClient</em>. <code>becl_game_data</code> is defined by the game and contains functions that <em>BEClient</em> needs to call (for example, send_packet) while <code>becl_be_data</code> is defined by <em>BEClient</em> and contains callbacks used by the game after initialisation (for example, received_packet). Note that these two structures slightly differ in some games that have special functionality, such as the recently introduced packet encryption in <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> that we’ve already <a href="https://secret.club/2020/06/19/battleye-packet-encryption.html">cracked</a>. Older versions of BattlEye (DayZ, Arma, etc.) use a completely different approach with function pointer swap hooks to intercept traffic communication, and therefore these structures don’t apply.</p><p>A simple <em>Init</em> implementation would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_game_data<span>*</span> game_data,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_be_data<span>*</span> client_data)
{
    <span>// CACHE RELEVANT FUNCTIONS</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet    <span>=</span> game_data<span>-&gt;</span>send_packet;

    <span>// SETUP CLIENT STRUCTURE</span>
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>exit                   <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>exit;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>run                    <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>run;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>command                <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>command;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>received_packet        <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>received_packet;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>on_receive_auth_ticket <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>on_receive_auth_ticket;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>add_peer               <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>add_peer;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>remove_peer            <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>remove_peer;

    <span>return</span> battleye<span>::</span>instance_status<span>::</span>SUCCESSFULLY_INITIALIZED;
}
</code></pre><p>This would allow our custom BattlEye client to receive packets sent from the game server’s <em>BEServer</em> module.</p><p>The function <code>received_packet</code> is by far the most important routine used by the game, as it handles incoming packets from the BattlEye server component. BattlEye communication is extremely simple compared to how important the integrity of it is. In recent versions of BattlEye, packets follow the same general structure:</p><pre><code><span>#pragma pack(push, 1)
</span><span>struct</span> <span>be_fragment</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> count;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> index;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet_header</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> id;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> sequence;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet</span> <span>:</span> be_packet_header
{
    <span>union</span> 
    {
        be_fragment fragment;

        <span>// DATA STARTS AT body[1] IF PACKET IS FRAGMENTED</span>
        <span>struct</span>
        {
            <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> no_fragmentation_flag;
            std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> body[<span>0</span>];
        };
    };
    <span>inline</span> <span>bool</span> fragmented()
    {
        <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>!=</span> <span>0x00</span>;
    }
};
<span>#pragma pack(pop)
</span></code></pre><p>All packets have an identifier and a sequence number (which is used by the requests/response communication and the heartbeat). Requests and responses have a fragmentation mode which allows <em>BEServer</em> and <em>BEClient</em> to send packets in chunks of <code>0x400</code> bytes (seemingly arbitrary) instead of sending one big packet.</p><p>In the current iteration of BattlEye, the following packets are used for communication:</p><h3 id="init-00"> <a href="#init-00">INIT (<code>00</code>)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent to the <em>BEClient</em> module as soon as the connection with the game server has been established. This packet is only transmitted once, contains no data besides the packet id <code>00</code> and the response to this packet is simply <code>00 05</code>.</p><h3 id="start-02"> <a href="#start-02">START (‘02’)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent right after the ‘INIT’ packets have been exchanged, and contains the server-generated guid of the client. The response of this packet is simply the header: <code>02 00</code></p><h3 id="request-04--response-05"> <a href="#request-04--response-05">REQUEST (<code>04</code>) / RESPONSE (<code>05</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is sent from <em>BEServer</em> to <em>BEClient</em> to request (and in rare cases, simply transmit) data, and <em>BEClient</em> will send back data for that request using the <code>RESPONSE</code> packet type.</p><p>The first request contains crucial information such as service- and integration version, not responding to it will get you disconnected by the game server. Afterwards, requests are game specific.</p><h3 id="heartbeat-09"> <a href="#heartbeat-09">HEARTBEAT (<code>09</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is used by the <em>BEServer</em> module to ensure that the connection hasn’t been dropped. It is sent every 30 seconds using a sequential index, and if the client doesn’t respond with the same packet, the client is disconnected from the game server. This heartbeat packet is only three bytes long, with the sequential index used for synchronization being incremental and therefore easily emulated. An example heartbeat could be: <code>09 01 00</code>, which is the second heartbeat (sequence starts at zero) transmitted.</p><p>With this knowledge, it is possible by emulating the entire BattlEye anti-cheat with only two proprietary points of data: the responses for request sequence one and two. These can be intercepted using a tool such as wireshark and replayed as many times as you want for the respective game, because the packet encryption used by BattlEye is static and contextless.</p><p>Emulating the <code>INIT</code> packet is as stated simply responding with the sequence number five:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT<span>:</span>
{
    <span>auto</span> info_packet <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>be_packet{};
    info_packet.id       <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT;
    info_packet.sequence <span>=</span> <span>0x05</span>;

    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(<span>&amp;</span>info_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(info_packet));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>START</code> packet is done by replying with the received packet’s header:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>START<span>:</span>
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>HEARTBEAT</code> packets is done by replying with the received packet:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>HEARTBEAT<span>:</span>    
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, length);
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>REQUEST</code> packets can be done by replaying previously generated responses, which can be logged with code hooks or man-in-the-middle software. These packets are game specific and some games might disconnect you for not handling a specific request, but most games only require the first two requests to be handled, afterwards simply replying with the packet header is enough to not get disconnected by the game server. It is important to notice that all <code>REQUEST</code> packets are immediately responded to with the header, to let the server know that the client is aware of the request. This is how BottlEye emulates them:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>REQUEST<span>:</span>
{
    <span>// IF NOT FRAGMENTED RESPOND IMMEDIATELY, ELSE ONLY RESPOND TO THE LAST FRAGMENT</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> respond <span>=</span> 
        <span>!</span>header<span>-&gt;</span>fragmented() <span>||</span> 
        (header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.index <span>==</span> header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>-</span> <span>1</span>);

    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>respond)
        <span>return</span>;

    <span>// SEND BACK HEADER</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));

    <span>switch</span> (header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence)
    {
    <span>case</span> <span>0x01</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence,
            {
                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>
            });
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>case</span> <span>0x02</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence,

                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>

        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>default:</span>

<p>Everyone has the same amount of time in a day, except for the day they are born and the day that they die. Those days are started late and ended early, respectively. Every other day is the same, 24 hours. </p>



<p>Most of what happens within our days are the results of choices, concious or otherwise. I may choose to sleep 8 hours while someone else chooses only to sleep 5. I am sure you have often heard people respond to something that they say they want to do with “I don’t have time”. “I know I should work out but I don’t have time … I wish I spent more time with my kids but I don’t have time … I love to read but I just don’t have time anymore.” These people are either lying to you, or more likely, they are lying to themselves. </p>



<p>Most of us feel we do not have time for things but in reality we do not have the relative desire for them. We may want them, but we do not want them as much as the other things we are doing with our time. If we did, we would do them instead. Importantly, I am not referring to a spoken want but an actual one. I can say I want six pack abs but if I am not willing to put in the physical work to get there I don’t really want that more than the other things I spend my time doing during my days.</p>



<p>Most of the time, most people don’t truly want hardly anything as much as they want to check Instagram or Twitter or email. Of course, these are not the things they want directly but a means towards getting them. A dopamine hit from an Instagram like, a bite size piece of information or entertainment from a Tweet, or a sense of purpose through a feeling that one is needed, good at their job, and therefore good at something because they are known to respond to their emails in less than 10 minutes no matter the hour or the day. I know these things from experience.</p>



<p>The fact is that when one truly wants something and wants it more than everything else competing for the time in their day, one will absolutely make the time for that thing. Time does not come out of thin air. It comes from the other things we occupy ourselves doing. Everything is a trade-off. We operate based on a descending list of the things we care about whether we know them are not. </p>



<p>To understand what a real want feels like, it is helpful to think about and experience the fundamentals. Years ago, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcJHC9J7l4">an awesome motivational speech by a guy named Eric Thomas</a> where he tells his students they will be successful when they want it as badly as a person who is drowning wants to breathe (if you want to watch the first 3 minutes you will get the gist). Occasionally, I run several miles without a water bottle and I am reminded in the last couple of miles what it feels like to be truly thirsty, to want nothing but water. When you are sick, you usually want nothing but to feel better. When you are starving, all you want to do is eat. You will make time for what you want most. We can only do so much at a time and more distractions than ever are competing for our attention. This is why so many people feel there is not enough time in the day. </p>



<p>Next time you think about something you want to do or know you should do but “don’t have time” for, think again. You have the time, you just don’t care enough. In many cases, you will be content with that realization. In others, you will want to change it. Fortunately, you can. It is not about time. It is about you.</p>

		<h3>How to become a Bayesian in eight easy steps: An annotated reading list</h3>
<p><em>(TLDR: We wrote an annotated reading list to get you started in learning Bayesian statistics. <span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-017-1317-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Published version</a></span>. <span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301981861_How_to_become_a_Bayesian_in_eight_easy_steps_An_annotated_reading_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Researchgate</a>. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PsyArxiv</a></span>.)</em></p>
<p>It can be hard to know where to start when you want to learn about&nbsp;Bayesian statistics.&nbsp;I am frequently asked&nbsp;to share&nbsp;my favorite&nbsp;introductory resources to Bayesian statistics, and my go-to answer has been to share a dropbox folder with a bunch of PDFs that aren’t really sorted or cohesive. In some sense&nbsp;I was acting as&nbsp;little&nbsp;more than a glorified Google Scholar search bar.</p>
<p>It seems like there is&nbsp;some&nbsp;tension out there with regard to Bayes, in that many people want to know more about it, but when they pick up, say, Andrew Gelman and colleagues’&nbsp;<em>Bayesian Data Analysis</em> they get totally overwhelmed. And then they just think, “Screw this esoteric B.S.” and give up because it doesn’t seem like it is worth their time or effort.</p>
<p>I think this&nbsp;happens a lot. Introductory Bayesian texts usually assume a level of training in mathematical statistics that most researchers simply don’t have time (or otherwise don’t need) to learn. There are actually&nbsp;a lot of accessible Bayesian resources&nbsp;out there that don’t require much math stat background at all, but it just so happens&nbsp;that they are not consolidated anywhere so people don’t necessarily know about them.</p>
<h3>Enter the eight step program</h3>
<p>Beth Baribault, Peter Edelsbrunner (<span><a href="https://twitter.com/peter1328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@peter1328</a></span>), Fabian Dablander (<span><a href="https://twitter.com/fdabl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@fdabl</a></span>), Quentin Gronau, and I have just finished <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a&nbsp;new paper</a></span> that tries to&nbsp;remedy this situation, titled, “How to become a Bayesian in eight easy steps: An annotated reading list.” We were invited to submit this paper for a special issue on Bayesian statistics for&nbsp;<em>Psychonomic Bulletin and Review</em>.&nbsp;Each paper in the special issue addresses a specific question we often hear about Bayesian statistics, and ours was the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a reviewer/editor handling a manuscript that uses Bayesian methods; which articles should I read to get a quick idea of what that means?</p></blockquote>
<p>So <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>‘s goal is not so much to teach readers how to actually&nbsp;<em>perform</em> Bayesian data analysis — there are other papers in the special issue for that — but to facilitate readers in their quest to understand basic Bayesian concepts. We think it will&nbsp;serve as a nice introductory reading list for any interested researcher.</p>
<p>The format of <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span> is straightforward. We highlight&nbsp;eight papers that had a big impact on our own understanding of Bayesian statistics, as well as short descriptions of an additional 28 resources in the&nbsp;<em>Further reading </em>appendix. The first four papers&nbsp;are focused on theoretical introductions, and the second four&nbsp;have a&nbsp;slightly more applied focus.</p>
<p>We also give every resource&nbsp;a ranking from 1–9 on two dimensions: Focus (theoretical vs. applied) and Difficulty (easy vs. hard). We tried to provide a wide range of resources, from easy&nbsp;applications (#14: Wagenmakers, Lee, and Morey’s “Bayesian benefits for the pragmatic researcher”) to challenging&nbsp;theoretical discussions (#12: Edwards, Lindman and Savage’s “Bayesian statistical inference for psychological research”) and others&nbsp;in between.</p>
<p>The figure below (Figure A1, available on the last page of <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>) summarizes our rankings:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2338" data-permalink="https://alexanderetz.com/2016/02/07/understanding-bayes-how-to-become-a-bayesian-in-eight-easy-steps/readinglist/#main" data-orig-file="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png" data-orig-size="1100,1000" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Readinglist" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=700" src="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=700" alt="Readinglist.png" srcset="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=700 700w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=150 150w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=300 300w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=768 768w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=1024 1024w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>The emboldened numbers (1–8) are the papers that we’ve commented on&nbsp;in detail, numbers in light text (9–30) are papers we briefly describe in the appendix, and the italicized numbers (31–36) are our recommended introductory books (also listed in the appendix).</p>
<p>This is how we chose to frame&nbsp;<span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, the guide is designed such that a researcher might be able to read all eight of the highlighted articles and some supplemental readings within a few days. After readers acquaint themselves with these sources, they should be well-equipped both to interpret existing research and to evaluate new research that relies on Bayesian methods.</p></blockquote>
<h3>The list</h3>
<p>Here’s the list of papers we chose to cover&nbsp;in detail:</p>

</ol>
<p>You’ll have to check out&nbsp;<span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span> to see our commentary&nbsp;and to find out what other articles we&nbsp;included in the&nbsp;<em>Further reading</em> appendix. We provide urls (web archived when possible;&nbsp;<span><a href="http://archive.org/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archive.org/web/</a></span>) to PDFs of the eight main papers (except #2, that’s on the DBDA website), and wherever possible for the rest of the resources (some did not have free copies online;&nbsp;see&nbsp;the <em>References</em>).</p>
<p>I thought this was a fun&nbsp;paper&nbsp;to write, and if you think you might want to learn some Bayesian basics I hope you will consider reading it.</p>
<p>Oh, and I should mention that we wrote the whole paper collaboratively on <span><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/signup?ref=19f671ddd62a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overleaf.com</a></span>. It is a great site that makes it easy to&nbsp;get started using&nbsp;LaTeX, and I highly recommend trying it out.</p>
<p>This is the fifth post in the&nbsp;<span><em><a href="https://alexanderetz.com/understanding-bayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understanding Bayes</a></em></span> series. Until next time,</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago we wrote about "<a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">Our Experience with Stripe Atlas</a>" and what it was like to use them to start a small internet business (tldr; generally good).</p>
<p>One of the perks of Stripe Atlas is that they offer a heap of credits for multiple cloud platforms. From the Stripe site:</p>
<p>"Stripe Atlas founders can access free credits, exclusive access to free products, and discounted pricing from our partners, including $5,000 in credits from Amazon Web Services and $10,000 in credits from DigitalOcean."</p>
<p>There's always an understanding with services like this that credit offers come with a lot of hand-waving and "caveat emptor"-ing: notice founders "<em>have access to</em>" free credits (emphasis ours), which could imply that some founders have the capacity to call on those funds, but not all. But still, the language does seem very direct and makes it easy to believe signing up includes $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We have not received $5,000 in AWS credits. But now the good news: We <em>have</em> still received <strong>$1,000 in AWS credits</strong>.</p>
<p>$1,000 is still very generous, and a great gift from Stripe. No business filing with Stripe Atlas should ever depend on $1,000 of AWS credits as some kind of life-or-death runway, and for everyone receiving it it's more a small bonus than some kind of critical seed money.</p>
<p>But I do think it's useful to note, if you're an entrepreneur considering Stripe Atlas, what general figures you can expect. We're not a high capital-intensive operation of course, so if you're in a similar micro-saas space, then you also probably won't get the full 5k.</p>
<p>We're not sure what path you should take <em>to get</em> that possible $5,000 in AWS credits. There's not much communication about what criteria Stripe uses to arrive at the number they finalize on.</p>
<p>But you heard it from us: Take that 5,000 number with a grain of salt. It's a great gift - just maybe not as great as you think.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>In this blog post, I would like to show you a practical example of a “fake it till you make it” approach to product development. To my mind, it basically means that you are trying to stay a few steps ahead of your current situation. You are “faking” the idea that you have progressed more, but you actually haven’t. This approach gave me invaluable answers for my product which were hard to get otherwise.</p><h2 id="here-is-my-story">Here is my story:</h2><p>3 years ago, my former manager came to me and told me to do around 1500 banner ads. The company I worked for got new products and they wanted to market them in different countries. We got 6 products in 5 colors and the aim was to create ad banners for 3 countries. The goal was to create 15 formats of each banner ad. It was a nightmare for the graphic department. And I was its team leader.</p><p>When I imagined myself doing 1500 banner ads, I wanted to cry. This scenario of creating thousands of banners could happen easily every month. It is possible to do manually 1500 ad banners, but it is just… too boring! I wanted to be a creator, not a generator.</p><p>I started immediately googling how I can automate the process of creating banners sets. I found some solutions but they were pretty useless. They weren’t flexible enough.</p><p>I decided to create my own solution. I experimented with Photoshop, more specifically with the “Actions” feature there. Basically, the Actions feature was recording my steps in Photoshop. So, I could record how I manually generated banners, then play it again and&nbsp;generate the banners. It was pretty simple: Yet powerful. With this script I created, I was able to automate some parts of the process and help our department to be faster.</p><p>I was interested in a community of graphic designers who had the same problem. With my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/iChangeTheWay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ivan</a>, I created a landing page in a few hours. <a href="https://twitter.com/tmvst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tomas</a> sketched the logo in 5 minutes, then we came up with pricing. I created a video of the script and…</p><p>I posted it to a local Facebook designers’ community group.</p><p>And this is what happened:</p><p><span>

It wasn’t cheap, it cost around 110€. Looking back retrospectively, I think it was… a miracle. It showed me that the problem was there and people were willing to pay for the solution.</p><p>At that time I didn’t know anything about building a product, selling, consumer behavior, or SaaS (Software as a Service). Well, I knew the theory, but just from videos, friends, or lectures. But I didn’t have any tangible experience.</p><h2 id="i-started-with-experimentation">I started with experimentation.</h2><p>I created <strong>a free version of a Photoshop ad generator as a Freemium model,</strong> which could automate only 6 banner formats in contrast to the full version which could automate 20 formats. I gave it for free to people in exchange for getting feedback from them.</p><p>To be honest…</p><p>0 people bought the full version after they tried the free version.</p><p>Frankly put, it failed. I was overly optimistic&nbsp;and thought that the product would do better. On the other hand, It motivated me to ask people what was not working for them and how I could get better. I even gave the full professional freelancers version, which cost 110€, for free in exchange for feedback.</p><p>And what happened?</p><p><strong>Nobody wrote me back.</strong></p><p>It sucked. I didn’t know what to do next.</p><p>At that time I let it go. I didn’t have money to build the product and I didn’t feel that I had enough experience to build the software from scratch.</p><h2 id="after-more-than-a-year-break">After more than a year break</h2><p>After a year and a half, I decided to explore this topic again. I learned new things from Product Management, User Experience design, I was closer to friends who were dealing with product development on a daily basis. So I gave it a try.</p><p>The last script didn’t work for all graphics of banners, it worked only for a few specific graphics. It was good, but once you wanted to generate some complicated banner, this script did not work smoothly. Meanwhile, Photoshop developed a few other features, which changed the game. My game.</p><h2 id="little-technical-context">Little technical context</h2><p>Scripts are technically the easiest to do however, they are quite limited. I decided to learn more about what was feasible in Photoshop. I’d learned about plugins, which seemed like the right way to do things. However, to do a plugin, I needed a front end developer, because I couldn’t code on a sufficient level.</p><p>The problem is that building something with a developer is the most expensive thing to do. And I didn’t even know if people were still interested in the solution. The only thing I knew was that I wanted to improve generating ad banners as much as I could, but how it should work? I had no clue.</p><h2 id="just-do-it">Just do it!</h2><p>But I had something that I believed was powerful. Designer superpower. Really, Sam? Superpower?… Yes, superpower. Let me explain.</p><p>If I want to get rid of generating, what should I do? I could&nbsp; just hit some magic button and everything would be set. But how would it work? It’s time for 🥁 designer superpower, (which I believe is a designers’ toolset).</p><p><span>

<em>Designer superpower - designers<!-- -->’<!-- --> toolset</em></p><p>I realized that I could “fake” the whole plugin and interactions in it.

<em>Preparation for video.</em></p><p>Then I needed somehow to fake the algorithm of generating banners. So I recorded screen videos and I got rid of some parts. I removed these parts where I needed to manually re-organize components in banners. In the end, these screen recordings looked like a great generating algorithm.</p><p>Now the final part. I needed to connect these parts. For this purpose I used Adobe After Effects.</p><p>And this is the final video which took me 2 weeks to do:</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/JWApMjQ3-jE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/JWApMjQ3-jE</a></p><p>I showed this video to friends of mine and they thought that I had learned how to code. At that point, I knew I had done it well.</p><p><strong>🗒Side note:</strong> When you think of that, this is a superpower. With some tools, you can show people (in my case graphic designers) the future them and spark imagination. You can take some ideas and make them look real. Suddenly, all the people can see how your product should behave and what it should do. Isn’t that powerful?</p><p><span>

      </picture>
    </span>
<em>Facebook post with video which gave me 400 signups</em></p><p>I added my <a href="https://www.bannerium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">landing page</a> in the post, then I shared it to other groups/forums and I got 400 signups.</p><p>I even got some deal with a design agency, which told me that they would give us some money to develop a plugin. Moreover, I even had 2 meetings with them. Just based on the video.</p><p>In the end, nothing came from this deal. That was reasonable. Here is why: The truth was, that I had just released the video. I didn’t have anything else. Just some parts connected with duct tape. At that time, I had no clue how close we could get with the real code.</p><p><strong>💡Lesson learned</strong></p><p>Showing a “fake” video is powerful for sharing a vision and testing if there is a need for a solution. On the other hand, if the video is too ambitious, people will take it as a norm and will base their expectations on the video. If the real product doesn’t match the video afterward, they will probably be unsatisfied because the product is&nbsp;incomplete. This thing happened to me when I had a call with a user during beta testing. She expected that the complete product should work as it was on the video. So sometimes it is better to be realistic. Otherwise, you will create unhappy initial users. But I believe it is a trade-off and you need to count on that.</p><p>Once I saw that the product was still in demand I found a programmer called Petr and we started with the development of the plugin. The video was also a great tool for how to communicate what I wanted to achieve. Of course, video showed happy path&nbsp;and I needed to design “what if” scenarios, afterwards. But it served my expectations&nbsp;perfectly.</p><p>Then we went through beta testing, which 50 people joined. Nowadays the <a href="https://bannerium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">product is live.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2><h3 id="a-designer-toolset-is-a-superpower-you-can-easily-create-something-that-was-not-on-the-market-before-and-validate-your-idea-just-in-a-week">A Designer toolset is a superpower.

<article>
    <p>Have you ever thought how good it would be to have a help message for your shell script
that you wrote a month ago and already forgot what it is supposed to do?</p>
<p>Yeah, there is always a way to show a message using cat (meow) or a bunch of echo
calls.</p>
<p>But there is a neat trick.</p>
<p>Add your message with all the required information on top of your file, just right
after the shebang.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span><span>###</span>
<span>### my-script — does one thing well</span>
<span>###</span>
<span>### Usage:</span>
<span>###   my-script &lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;</span>
<span>###</span>
<span>### Options:</span>
<span>###   &lt;input&gt;   Input file to read.</span>
<span>###   &lt;output&gt;  Output file to write. Use '-' for stdout.</span>
<span>###   -h        Show this message.</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Halfway done, now need to get this message in runtime with sed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">help<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    sed -rn <span>'s/^### ?//;T;p'</span> <span>"</span><span>$0</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>$0</code> means a filename of a file that is being executed.</p>
<p>A bit about the magic that is going here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>s</code> — stands for substitute the following pattern;</li>
<li><code>/</code> — keyword to define start/end of the pattern;</li>
<li><code>^### ?</code> — match a string starting with ### and an optional space after;</li>
<li><code>//</code> — there could be something between the slashes, but since nothing is here, replace
the pattern with an empty string;</li>
<li><code>T</code> — Jumps to the end of sed-script if no s/// has done a successful substitution;</li>
<li><code>p</code> — Prints the result of the substitution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now just call the <code>help</code> function if an arg <code>-h</code> or no args passed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$#</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>]]</span> <span>||</span> <span>[[</span> <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"-h"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>help</span>
    <span>exit</span> <span>1</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Hope it helps, cheers!</p>

<h2>Prelude</h2>



<p><em>I have been writing about </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2010/04/05/black-founders/"><em>Diversity in Tech for over a decade now</em></a><em> – a long time. However, my self-published posts have never really got the audience it was targeted at, which is, the Silicon Valley Main Street. This time around, I wanted to do something different with regard to distribution.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Since I completed this post over two weeks ago, I’ve hawked it as an Op-Ed to </em><strong><em>ALL</em></strong><em> main street US (Tech) media – 22 of them. Sadly, but unsurprisingly and understandably, I’ve had no takers. It is a big request to ask anyone, including journalists, to give a dissenting voice an audience, so I have decided to self-publish again, but this time around, I hope the primary intended audience gets to see it and the conversation happens. <strong>Abeg (please), share it</strong> as you wish me luck holding these very powerful people to account.</em></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>No thanks to the brutal execution of George Floyd and more importantly, thanks to the persistence of protesters, the conversation about institutional racism in various parts of American life is back to the fore and has been sustained. The tech industry has not been exempted.</p>



<p>As with previous cycles, it has cast blame towards the typical suspects: Big Tech and Venture Capital. And as with previous conversation cycles, one key player in the diversity deficient tech world is wriggling away unscathed, yet again. Silicon Valley Big Tech Media.</p>



<h2>Pattern Matching in Tech</h2>



<p><em>Pattern matching</em> is a colloquial terminology in the tech industry that refers to the propensity for established players in tech e.g. Venture Capitalists, taking superficial patterns of successful founders (young white boys who have dropped out of Stanford or Harvard) and using them to determine future investment decisions.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I can be tricked by anyone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg”</p><cite><em>Paul Graham (According to The New York Times)</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Though <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/tricked.html">eventually clarified by Paul Graham</a>, that attributed quote articulately captures the spirit of Pattern Matching. Since how one “looks” is one of the obvious patterns one can observe in a human, it is believed that pattern matching disproportionally affects “people of colour” (why do we use this term?).</p>



<p>I have no problem with pattern matching. In psychology it is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>, which is natural and critical for survival. It is how human beings recognise things and make vital decisions quickly, with little data.</p>



<p>My first memory of Pattern Matching was while playing football (the real one) as a kid. The guys with the bow-legged swagger, wearing boots and a shin guard were always picked first. It was almost automatic because they looked like talented footballers. And that’s how I learned to pick my teams. After missing out on some straight legged barefoot talents and picking several kitted-out clowns, I adjusted and used more sensible parameters.</p>



<p>I learned something from that though: Pattern matching is all well and good until it receives contradicting data. It’s all about the data.</p>



<h2>The Role of Big Tech Media in Pattern Matching</h2>



<p>In the past decade, Big Tech Media has rightfully shone the light on racial inequality in the ranks of Big Corporations and Venture Capital in the tech industry. The Diversity Reports — as they are known, of Big Tech and VC have been published routinely.</p>



<p>The media are very powerful. It is through them we learn and understand the world beyond ourselves. Their importance and power in shaping opinions cannot be overstated as they are very key in providing the data which influences patterns that lead to decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Tech, when it comes to personnel, a lot of that data comes in the form of presence. The Big Tech Media controls it all via narrative and coverage in their publications and mega conferences. It is through the media that every player – VCs, Tech Executives, Founders etc learn about the tech world that exists outside of their immediate spheres.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to the diversity in tech debate, I wonder: how have Big Tech Media, the primary opinion shapers of the tech industry, escaped any scrutiny? Then it hit me: when you are busy pointing your torch at others, you forget to point it at yourself.</p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media remains a critical piece if we are to rejig the data to alter diversity-deficient patterns in tech, it’s high-time we shone the light on Big Tech Media.</p>



<p><em>[RANDOM: Watching the film </em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/"><em>Hidden Figures</em></a><em> made me almost cry. I had </em><strong><em>absolutely no idea</em></strong><em> that in the 60s, there were Black women mathematicians and programmers who were good enough to work for the NASA Space Program. Imagine if this was always common knowledge. I can only imagine how many more black folks it would have influenced to take up a career in Computer Science and Technology].</em></p>



<h2>Diversity Report of (Silicon Valley) Big Tech Media</h2>



<p>In 2015, I looked at <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2015/10/15/where-are-the-black-tech-foundersexecutive-speakers-at-major-tech-conferences/">the racial makeup of the largest tech conferences in the world</a>. The results were damning. I wondered how these organisers could be so oblivious. It then occurred to me to check out the people making these decisions, and it was clear why they were colour blind; they didn’t have the right ‘lenses’ i.e., makeup of the editorial/media team, to notice the absence of certain colours.</p>



<p>In this report card, I will look at the racial diversity makeup of both speaker line-ups and the editorial teams of Big Tech Media – who are mostly in Silicon Valley, and contrast their 2015 with today.</p>



<h2>The Candidates</h2>



<h3><strong>TechCrunch</strong></h3>



<p>TechCrunch, owned by AOL/Verizon has been the Big Dog of tech startup chronicling and commentary since 2005. More so, they host arguably the largest and most influential startup conference called Disrupt. I have followed TechCrunch since 2007 and experienced the startup evolution through them.</p>



<h3><strong>Recode</strong></h3>



<p>In the past decade, Recode has evolved from being All Things Digital at WSJ to being Independent to now being a unit at Vox Media. One constant throughout its evolution has been the very formidable Kara Swisher, who is arguably the single most influential person in Big Tech Media.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Information</strong></h3>



<p>This subscription-based tech publication is high up the list in shaping opinion among Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley. It was started by Jessica Lessin who is a formidable reporter and an Alumnus of WSJ. They have a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/vc-diversity-index">VC Diversity Index</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Business Insider</strong></h3>



<p>Based in New York and founded by the great Henry Blodget, Business Insider is a top 3 tech voice in the tech industry.</p>



<h3><strong>Protocol</strong></h3>



<p>Backed by a bunch of heavyweights, this publication launched this year with a lot of panache.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How well have they done?</p>



<h2>Racial Diversity Report Card of Major US/Silicon Valley Tech Media</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6Bmj3M1sgqCR3PijCsyoYF5OrovGUDFEEujYSItZb0/edit?usp=sharing">Here is the data for this table</a> in spreadsheet format and links to sources.</p>







<p>It is good to highlight problems but better to proffer solutions. But first, do these people recognise that there is a problem? Do they want to solve it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015 when I wrote my previous post, I had the impression some did. In my <a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian/status/738076047539896321">Twitter engagement with Kara Swisher</a> after my first post, Aunty Kara gave the patronising response by referencing “the adept use of social media” as a representation of Black in Tech, I offered to engage privately (I threw in my<a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian/status/802151006754795520"> beer diplomacy</a> for good measure). It came to nought.</p>



<p><em>[Shalaye (Explanation): Aunty Kara took me up on the offer. As agreed, I reached out on 3 subsequent trips to the US and Silicon Valley. After sending about half a dozen emails, initially replied with excuses, Kara went cold and stopped responding. She is not the first Silicon Valley person whose Twitter (public) position contrasts with their private ones, so I haven’t taken it personally. I’d be more than happy to grab that beer if she’s open to it]</em></p>



<p>If Big Tech companies especially the media wish to change things, they have to first stop being colour-blind and get competent people who have eyes for the blind spots. A deliberate, sincere effort will yield good fruit.</p>



<p><strong>If you are a privileged person in the tech industry who wants to be a true “ally” and see things improve, here are some actionable things to do:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ol><li>If you are on yet another panel and you notice the absence of accomplished Black tech players, speak up. Make recommendations. I am happy for you to ask me if your black network isn’t that vast. See Appendix (<strong>Note:</strong> Black folks have great competence about things outside the diversity topic).</li><li>If you are a VC and you are in on a good deal, try to work with the founder and carve out an allocation for those good black investors that aren’t as opportune to have your network. We all know the deal flow is the <em>koko (main thing).</em> If you want to help, share the deal.</li><li>If you are recruiting for a senior role in your executive team or board, you can take a book from the NFL beyond Colin Kaepernick’s brave kneeling protest; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule">Rooney Rule</a>. Just make sure you have a qualified black person in your interview shortlist. That’s not too much of an ask.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>I wrote in an email to my white founder friend recently: <em>I see many organisations “fighting” systemic racism by opening their cheque books. A donation here, a freebie there. It makes them feel good, perhaps. It’s like a retweet but with money.</em></p>



<p>So, decide if you want to show concern or effect change. I prefer both.</p>







<ol><li>Every company (including Big Tech Media) has the prerogative to invite or cover anyone they like. However, the proprietors of Tech Media cannot play watchmen and feign concern about the diversity in tech debate while their actions are in direct contrast.</li><li>In this post, I focused on these …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>Around 1.5 years ago, I did an <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis">analysis of YouTube trending videos</a> in US. That analysis was performed on trending videos of some months in 2017 and 2018. The analysis received a lot of interest on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis">Kaggle</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9kpmcn/i_analyzed_more_than_40000_youtube_trending/">Reddit</a>; I also received some emails praising the work done. That was 1.5 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Today</strong>, I present an improved and expanded version of that analysis. This analysis is more advanced and contains new interesting elements. In this analysis, <strong>All trending videos for the whole year of 2019</strong> were analyzed (More than <strong>70,000</strong> videos).</p>

<p>Titles, descriptions, thumbnails, tags, views, likes/dislikes, and comments were all analyzed to produce the results shown in this post. Continue reading to know more about the analysis and the data or you can <a href="#analysis-res">jump directly to the results section</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-youtube-trending-videos">What are YouTube Trending Videos?</h2>

<p>YouTube, as you know, is the most popular and most used video platform in the world today. YouTube has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending">a list of <strong>trending videos</strong></a>. I’ll quote the description of trending videos from <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739?hl=en">YouTube itself</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trending helps viewers see what’s happening on YouTube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos that a wide range of viewers would find interesting. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video. Trending isn’t personalized and displays the same list of trending videos in each country to all users.</p>

  <p>The list of trending videos is updated roughly every 15 minutes. With each update, videos may move up, down, or stay in the same position in the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="goals-of-the-analysis">Goals of the Analysis</h2>

<p>The main goal of the analysis is to find interesting facts and patterns by exploring the data and by using effective visualizations.</p>

<p>Some of the questions the analysis will answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the average/minimum/maximum view count for 2019’s trending videos?</li>
  <li>Which videos appeared on the trending list the most (because some videos might appear on the trending list for more than one day)?</li>
  <li>What are the most common words in the titles/descriptions/tags of trending videos?</li>
  <li>What are the title lengths of the trending videos? What is the average/minimum/maximum title length?</li>
  <li>Which channels have more trending videos than others?</li>
  <li>What are the top categories of trending videos? Are “Entertainment” videos more trending than “Gaming” videos?</li>
  <li>How many views/comments/likes trending videos have when first appearing on the trending list?</li>
  <li>How many days are between publishing a video and its first appearance on the trending list?</li>
  <li>How long are the descriptions/tags of trending videos?</li>
  <li>What are the most used colors in the thumbnails of trending videos?</li>
  <li>What are the most common objects in the thumbnails of trending videos? (Running AI object detection algorithm on all thumbnails)</li>
</ul>

<p>The analysis covers much more topics as you will see soon.</p>



<p>This analysis was performed using Python and a powerful group of Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, ImageAI, WordCloud, and more.</p>

<p>The analysis were performed in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<h3 id="code-used">Code Used</h3>

<p>You can find all the code used for this analysis in a Jupyter notebook <a href="https://github.com/ammar1y/YouTube-Trending-Videos-Analysis-2019">on this link</a>. Feel free to read the code and re-use it however you want. Also note that the notebook contains more analyses than the ones shown here in this post, so if you want to see everything, refer to the notebook after you finish reading this post.</p>

<h2 id="data-source">Data Source</h2>

<p>The data used in this analysis was retrieved using YouTube API. A script was scheduled to run <strong>each day throughout 2019 and fetch data from YouTube API about the trending videos of that day</strong>. The script would then process the data received from YouTube and store them in text files.</p>

<p>The scraping script is not my work. It can be found on Github: <a href="https://github.com/mitchelljy/Trending-YouTube-Scraper"> Trending-YouTube-Scraper</a>. I put the script on a AWS EC2 instance and scheduled it—using Crontab—to run every day at a specific time.</p>

<p>After 2019 ended, I connected to the AWS instance using FileZilla application and downloaded all the data produced by the script. There was a file for each day of 2019. To perform the analysis, I needed to process the data in order to merge the files into a single CSV file.</p>

<p>If you want to <strong>download the data used in this analysis</strong> which describes 2019's trending videos in the United States, you can buy it securely on Gumroad <u><strong><a href="https://gum.co/qEzKK" target="_blank">on this link</a></strong></u> or by using the button below. Along with United States, you'll also get trending-videos data for United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries as well.</p>

<h2 id="data-size-and-description">Data Size and Description</h2>

<p><strong>In this post, United-States trending videos will be analyzed</strong>, which constitute a total of <strong>72,994</strong> videos. YouTube usually place 200 videos in the trending list each day which would mean that we should have 73,000 (365 x 200) videos. We have 72,994. This is probably because on a few days, the number of Trending videos was slightly less than 200.</p>

<p>So we have data on 72,994 trending videos to analyze. On YouTube, <strong>the same video might appear on the trending list for many days. This means that the 72,994 videos are not unique videos</strong>. In fact, among the 72,994 videos, <strong>we have 11,177 unique videos</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, 11,177 videos showed on the trending list throughout 2019. Some of them might have stayed on the list for 10 days, some for 20 days, etc. We will see later in the analysis more info about this.</p>

<p>The following table shows an example of <strong>the data that we have for each video</strong>:</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p><br>
As we can see, we have the ID of the video which is a unique value for the video across YouTube (No two videos have the same ID). We also have the title of the video, its publishing date and time, the channel that published it, its category, and its description and tags. We also have the number of the views, likes, dislikes, and comments of the video. There are also a few more data shown in the table.</p>

<p>We can see that there is a field named “trending_date”. This field specifies the date on which this video was trending. As we said earlier, the same video might appear on the trending-videos list for more than one day. This means that we might find another record in the data for the same video ID but with different “trending_date” and maybe different number of views, comments, likes, etc. (because those numbers are likely to increase from one day to another).</p>



<h2 id="analysis-results">Analysis Results</h2>

<p>Now let’s start the best part of this post, let’s see the analysis results.</p>

<p><span id="note-uniq"></span><strong>Please note</strong> that for the following analyses, <strong>unless otherwise stated</strong>, we applied the analysis on all of the <strong>72,994</strong> trending videos, <strong>not</strong> on the unique trending videos only. The reasoning behind this is that we are interested in videos considered trending by YouTube. So if a video is considered trending for 3 days, then we believe that it has more trending power and more trending characteristics than a video that was trending for 1 day only; thus, it should have more weight. So <strong>we include the 3 occurrences of that video in the analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>For some analyses, considering only unique videos is more appropriate. When that is the case, you will see a note telling you about that.</p>

<h3 id="trending-videos-and-views">Trending Videos and Views</h3>

<p><strong>The Trending Video with the Highest Number of Views</strong> is a song by BTS band named “Boy With Luv”. The video was published on 12/April/2019 and on 23/04/2019, it appeared on the trending list with 195,376,667 views which is the highest number of views a trending video had in 2019.</p>

<p>In the table below, you can see <strong>the top 3 trending videos based on the number of views</strong>. These trending videos had views when they appeared on the trending list more than any other trending video. This table was produced by considering unique trending videos only (<a href="#note-uniq">For more</a>).</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-top-views.png" alt=""></p>



<p>And now we will look at the distribution of views for trending videos. The histogram below shows this distribution:</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-view-dist.png" alt=""></p>



<p><em>Notice that the y-axis is <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/logarithmic-scale.html">log scaled</a>. It is 10, 100, 1000… not 10, 20, 30…</em></p>

<p>We can see that the vast majority of trending videos had less than 20 million views when they became trending. In fact, when they became trending, around <strong>94% of trending videos had less than 10 million views</strong> and around 99.9% had less than 100 million views.</p>

<p>Now, we might ask: <strong>What are the trending videos with the least amount of views?</strong> The table below shows the 3 trending videos with the lowest number of views when appearing on the trending list. This table was produced by considering unique trending videos only (<a href="#note-uniq">For more</a>).</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-least-views.png" alt=""></p>

  <stylepoint title="Note: Displaying Hidden Details in this Guide">
     <summary>
       This style guide contains many details
       that are initially hidden from view.
       They are marked by the triangle icon, which you see here on your left.
       Click it now. You should see "Hooray" appear below.
     </summary>
     
       <p>
        Hooray!  Now you know you can expand points to get more details.
        Alternatively, there's an "expand all" at the top of this document.

<category title="Background">
  <p>
    Common Lisp is a powerful multiparadigm programming language.
    With great power comes great responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    This guide recommends formatting and stylistic choices
    designed to make your code easier for other people to understand.
    For those internal applications and free software libraries that
    we develop at Google,
    you should keep within these guidelines when making changes.
    Note however that each project has its own rules and customs
    that complement or override these general guidelines;
    the speed-oriented QPX low fare search engine notably
    has a very different style and feel from the QRes reservation system.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're writing Common Lisp code outside Google,
    we invite you to consider these guidelines.
    You may find some of them useful
    where they don't conflict with other priorities you have.
    We welcome remarks and constructive feedback
    on how to improve our guide, and
    on what alternate styles work for you and why.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This guide is not a Common Lisp tutorial.
    For basic information about the language, please consult
    <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>.
    For a language reference, please consult the
    <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">Common Lisp HyperSpec</a>.
    For more detailed style guidance, take (with a pinch of salt)
    a look at Peter Norvig and Kent Pitman's
    <a href="http://norvig.com/luv-slides.ps">style guide</a>.

</overview>
<category title="Meta-Guide">
  <stylepoint title="Must, Should, May, or Not">
    <summary>
      Each guideline's level of importance is indicated
      by use of the following keywords and phrases, adapted from
      <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.
    </summary>
    
      <table>
        <tbody><tr>

          <td>
            <p>
              This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL",
              means that the guideline is an absolute requirement.
              You must ask permission to violate a MUST.

        <tr>
          <th>MUST NOT</th>
          <td>
            <p>
              This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT",
              means that the guideline is an absolute prohibition.
              You must ask permission to violate a MUST NOT.

              This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", means that
              there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
              to ignore the demands of the guideline, but
              the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed
              before choosing a different course.
              You must ask forgiveness for violating a SHOULD.

              the full implications should be understood and carefully weighed

        Unlike RFCs, we don't capitalize every instance of one of the above
        keywords when it is used.
      </p>
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Permission and Forgiveness">
    <summary>
      There are cases where transgression of some of these rules
      is useful or even necessary.
      In some cases, you must seek permission or obtain forgiveness
      from the proper people.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Permission comes from the owners of your project.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Forgiveness is requested in a comment
        near the point of guideline violation,
        and is granted by your code reviewer.
        The original comment should be signed by you, and
        the reviewer should add a signed approval to the comment at review time.
      </p>
      
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Conventions">
    <summary>
      You MUST follow conventions. They are not optional.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Some of these guidelines are motivated by universal principles of good programming.
        Some guidelines are motivated by technical peculiarities of Common Lisp.
        Some guidelines were once motivated by a technical reason,
        but the guideline remained after the reason subsided.
        Some guidelines, such those about as comments and indentation,
        are based purely on convention, rather than on clear technical merit.
        Whatever the case may be, you must still follow these guidelines,
        as well as other conventional guidelines
        that have not been formalized in this document.
      </p>
      <p>
        You MUST follow conventions.
        They are important for readability.
        When conventions are followed by default,
        violations of the convention are a signal
        that something notable is happening and deserves attention.
        When conventions are systematically violated,
        violations of the convention are a distracting noise
        that needs to be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conventional guidelines <em>are</em> indoctrination.
        Their purpose is to make you follow the mores of the community,
        
        so you can more effectively cooperate with existing members.
        It is still useful to distinguish the parts that are technically motivated
        from the parts that are mere conventions,
        so you know when best to defy conventions for good effect,
        and when not to fall into the pitfalls that the conventions are there to help avoid.
      </p>
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Old Code">
    <summary>
      Fix old code as you go.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        A lot of our code was written before these guidelines existed.
        You should fix violations as you encounter them
        in the course of your normal coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not fix violations en masse
        without warning other developers and coordinating with them,
        so as not to make the merging of large branches
        more difficult than it already is.
      </p>
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Future Topics">
    <summary>
      There are many topics for additional standardization
      not covered by current version of this document,
      but deferred to future versions.

<category title="General Guidelines">
  <stylepoint title="Principles">
    <summary>
      There are some basic principles for team software development
      that every developer must keep in mind.
      Whenever the detailed guidelines are inadequate, confusing or contradictory,
      refer back to these principles for guidance:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every developer's code must be easy for another developer
          to read, understand, and modify
          â€” even if the first developer isn't around to explain it.
          (This is the "hit by a truck" principle.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Everybody's code should look the same.
          Ideally, there should be no way to look at lines of code
          and recognize it as "Fred's code" by its style.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be precise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be concise.
        </li>
        <li>
          KISS â€” Keep It Simple, Stupid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the smallest hammer for the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use common sense.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep related code together.
          Minimize the amount of jumping around
          someone has to do to understand an area of code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </summary>
    
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Priorities">
    <summary>
      <p>
        When making decisions about how to write a given piece of
        code, aim for the following -ilities in this priority order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Usability by the customer
        </li>
        <li>
          Debuggability/Testability
        </li>
        <li>
          Readability/Comprehensibility
        </li>
        <li>
          Extensibility/Modifiability
        </li>
        <li>
          Efficiency (of the Lisp code at runtime)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Most of these are obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usability by the customer means that the system has to do what the
        customer requires; it has to handle the customer's transaction
        volumes, uptime requirements; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Lisp efficiency point,
        given two options of equivalent complexity,
        pick the one that performs better.
        (This is often the same as the one that conses less,
        i.e. allocates less storage from the heap.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Given two options where one is more complex than the other,
        pick the simpler option and revisit the decision only if
        profiling shows it to be a performance bottleneck.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, avoid premature optimization.
        Don't add complexity to speed up something that runs rarely,
        since in the long run, it matters less whether such …</p></stylepoint></category></div></div>

<p>It was a frigid cold day in Des Moines on January 28, 2019.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Like most January days, I was just hoping to hold on a few more weeks until the early signs of Spring would start to thaw things out and give me that yearly boost of energy.</p>



<p>But, it turned out that I was going to get a different kind of jolt.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.hellosign.com/blog/a-letter-from-our-ceo-were-joining-dropbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dropbox Acquires HelloSign for $230mm (opens in a new tab)">Dropbox Acquires HelloSign for $230mm</a>,” the headline read in my push notifications.<br></p>



<p>I stared at it for a long time.</p>



<p>A combination of shock and elation took hold as I bounded out of bed.<br></p>



<p>HelloSign and Optimist had been working together for nearly two years at this point. But I had no idea that the acquisition was in play. The whole deal has been basically kept under wraps. Most of the team only found out about it right before it was finalized.<br></p>



<p>It was a momentous achievement for their team.<br></p>



<p>When we first started working with HelloSign, they had just raised their Series A and were on a path to rapidly expand their eSignature solution, roll out HelloWorks, and move upmarket with HelloSign integrations and API.<br></p>



<p>There was a lot to do and a lot of content and strategy to figure out.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>We had our work cut out for us.</em><br></p>



<p>Luckily, our team and the HelloSign team are both full of outrageously smart people. We dug in and put together a strategy.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IcibgJc6j5tpYXEm_m_ik9W_YNLIIrvzZmHTBHmriqbihYkO2NXDz9SogzmE-H203ML1Ju0uP7cRPqUx1tfIZVWA1m96_8xdxPLSvlIP7m05Ej7q9o3kuaEoE_oESJVNPETObhOq" alt="HelloSign's Organic Traffic Growth (October 2017 to January 2019)"></figure>



<p>Over the previous 17 months (and to this day), we worked closely with the HelloSign team to drive 1,308% growth in targeted organic traffic. This growth correlated almost perfectly with the growth of their business and the acquisition that took place in January.<br></p>



<p>Through this process and in working with many other SaaS companies over the years, we have developed and refined some key strategies and tactics that we use to drive growth for all of our clients and other SaaS businesses in particular.<br></p>



<p>From that, we’ve distilled those strategies into a core framework that defines how we achieve specific results and reach key goals.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This article is about that framework.</p>



<h2>Content Marketing for SaaS: Driving User Signups</h2>



<p>Nearly all SaaS companies have pretty straightforward goals for their content marketing:<br></p>



<ol><li>Drive product sign-ups and trials</li><li>Everything else. (Traffic, brand awareness,&nbsp;leads, emails, etc)</li></ol>



<p>HelloSign is no different.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Although they have a number of market focuses and products that were in play, the ultimate business objective of our work together was–unsurprisingly–to grow users.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, that’s what we set out to do.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The question, of course, is how you use content as a lever for both capturing the right audience, convincing them of the value of the product, and ultimately converting them into customers.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NE0svR6j4qHgtXc2V0wxw-XR_jXTW2e6L1PcoXncPqUFLJJf-5yorAWPbmSo7GTA0rQ1AVPBM5L13O3khI7G6SyuyCWMJdKTaxAHrwyqa1jQ8A24fTUK7JHuZ6iz4crHUrOTLlkI" alt=""></figure>



<p>In most instances, these goals feel at odds with one another. The content that is most valuable to you as a business (most product-focused) is often less valuable to a reader who is trying to learn about a topic or solve a problem broadly.<br></p>



<p>As with most content marketing frameworks, we find that the key is to unpack the specific moving parts and build a strategy that addresses each specific goal as part of a broader strategy.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In other words, break it down and solve for each piece independently. Then pull everything together into a cohesive framework.</p>



<h2>The SaaS Content Funnel Paradox</h2>



<p>Most SaaS product signups (trials, leads, etc) come from the middle of the funnel.<br></p>



<p>In other words, a prospect has researched their problem, discovered a general solution, and they begin researching products that offer it. In most cases, few prospects read content that’s at the top of the funnel and immediately hop into a product–it’s rare.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This means that in order for a SaaS content marketing strategy to be successful, you need to put a lot of emphasis on driving solution-aware traffic to content and pages that are in the middle of the funnel.<br></p>



<p><em>But there’s a challenge</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The pages on your site that are most relevant to a middle-of-the-funnel searcher are your core product pages–features, integrations, solutions, etc.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>These are notoriously difficult pages to rank (especially in a crowded market like esignatures) because there are very few ways for them to naturally accrue links or promote such product-focused content directly to a prospect.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1.png" alt="HelloSign's Product Marketing site is full of targeted landing pages" srcset="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1.png 1024w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1-980x521.png 980w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>This creates a paradox.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The pages that you care most about ranking and generating traffic to are also, often, the most difficult to rank and drive traffic to.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, how do you overcome this obstacle, resolve the paradox, and restore order to the universe? (Okay, maybe just that first part.)<br></p>



<p>The solution is to <a href="http://yesoptimist.com/frameworks">create a framework</a> that leverages <em>top of the funnel content</em> as a means to generate not just traffic, but also links (domain and topical authority) that helps these important pages rank over time.<br></p>



<p>This has become the basis for our work with most SaaS clients.</p>



<h2>The Optimist SaaS Content Marketing Framework</h2>



<p>Before we get into the specifics of how we executed this strategy, I want to reveal the framework that we use to shape our thinking and our approach.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This framework builds on our trifecta strategy that we originally developed from my work scaling College Raptor from <a href="https://www.yesoptimist.com/content-marketing-seo-case-study-the-trifecta-strategy/">0 to 100,000 organic searches/mo</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>But, given the specific nuances of the SaaS business model and the extended B2B buyer’s journey, it’s not a simple cut-and-paste process.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JdENWX5eN_LOMVx2I778zGXks82Eu5MkC92ktCgboJrcur7JAo8f4fL_h--FFGUsYwsffYMq9_RderLzTycXIEcGwE4gZKm9WyTrHe2w27jUojSYaRNlB8-e_WwMoQj5rkKBiHG0" alt=""></figure>



<p>The framework that we developed integrates key insights about how buyers interact with SaaS businesses and which strategies are most effective for driving actual conversions.<br></p>



<p>For our work with HelloSign, we applied a framework similar to this. Ultimately, we’ve found that most SaaS businesses have similar goals and thus, the overall approach to content marketing is a variation of this general framework.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s not one-size-fits-all, but it’s about as close as you can get when you’re talking about true strategy.<br></p>



<p>Let’s step through all of the types of content that were part of HelloSign’s massive growth.</p>



<h2>Pre-Funnel Content: Targeting the Right Buyers</h2>



<p>Before we dive into the actual funnel and the buyer’s journey, I want to begin with what we call pre-funnel or persona-qualified content.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Although it’s often at least one step removed from a buying cycle, pre-funnel content can serve an important supporting role in a SaaS content marketing strategy. The idea here is to create content that attracts your target buyer <em>broadly</em>, even if they aren’t problem-aware.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-1024x544.png" alt="Thought leadership content attracts relevant buyers, even if they are pre-funnel." srcset="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-1024x544.png 1024w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-980x521.png 980w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>Case in point: HelloSign speaks a lot to sales leaders in their content. We created a lot of content that was aimed at generally helping this persona do their job better, even if that didn’t involve using HelloSign’s products to do it.<br></p>



<p>This allows us to accomplish a number of things:&nbsp;<br></p>



<ol><li>Expand search/social footprint</li><li>Build brand awareness and familiarity with our target personas</li><li>Drive retargeting and email marketing</li></ol>



<p>But, keep in mind that this content, while valuable if used strategically, can also be a distraction from the key objective. It rarely leads to a product conversion.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Don’t let it become the center of your approach unless you have already built out every other part of the funnel in full.</p>



<h2>Top of the Funnel Content: Helping Prospects Solve Problems</h2>



<p>The top of the funnel is often misunderstood in the world of content marketing generally and SaaS, especially.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Our take is simple: <em>The top of the funnel starts when a buyer begins to actively learn about or seek a solution to problem that could lead to a purchase.</em><br></p>



<p>In the world of HelloSign, we see this as the pain point that the user is looking to solve that <em>could </em>ultimately lead to a product conversion.<br></p>



<p>If the buyer is a VP of Sales or Sales Operations Director, then they may begin their journey by looking to accelerate their sales cycle–cut down the days between contract and close.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>One solution to this problem is to implement esignatures.</em><br></p>



<p>So, from a content perspective, we target this initial need as an opportunity to capture the buyer at the point where they are looking for solutions to a problem. In my <a href="https://www.yesoptimist.com/saas-seo-strategy/">post about SaaS SEO</a>, I talked about our process of using a JTBD framework to identify and map these specific pain points to key product use cases and features.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Within the top of the funnel content, we break down our content strategy into <a href="http://yesoptimist.com/100k">3 key types of content that each serve a specific purpose</a>. I’ve outlined this approach before, but it allows us to get very specific and tactical while staying strategic in our content planning and creation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Social-viral content (Thought leadership)</h3>



<p>For HelloSign, what we pursue as social-viral content is strong thought leadership content that’s likely to generate a lot of shares and buzz around a particular topic.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>What we have found is that the more of a strong stance we are willing to take topics related to work, culture, and operations, the more reaction we generate among our target readers. Of course, this approach can be polarizing as well.<br></p>

            <p>Fractally broken a definition.</p>

<p><strong>Fractal</strong>: <em>A never ending pattern.</em><br><strong>Broken</strong>: <em>Not functioning properly.</em></p>

<p>This is a phrase I heard from <a href="https://kragniz.eu/">Louis Taylor</a> a few years ago and I absolutely love it. <em>Edit: I have been told that the original source may have been <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">https://eev.ee</a>.</em></p>

<p>It means that however much you zoom in or out from a thing it has faults. In an almost recursive manner.</p>

<p>It really sums up some projects. You look at the whole system and think some very bad words. Then you look at a component and think the same. Finally, you end up reading individual lines of code and the words continue flowing.</p>

<p>I also composed a limerick:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There once was a very bad project,</p>

  <p>With a fixed cost, scope and budget,</p>

  <p>It grew fractally broken,</p>

  <p>And the severs began smokin’,</p>

  <p>so none of the dev’s wanted to touch it.</p>
</blockquote>

				        PGA is a <b>plane-based geometric algebra</b> which appears eminently suited for the description and computation of operations in <b>3D Euclidean geometry</b>. 
It naturally contains, in a real framework, efficient motion representations like homogeneous coordinates and  dual quaternions, fully integrated with oriented object models. 
PGA's encoding of primitives and operators in blocks of four coordinates makes it very suitable for <b>fast GPU
implementation</b>.</p><p>

To satisfy the curiosity raised by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX4H_ctggYo&amp;t=1080s" target="blank"><b>2019 SIGGRAPH</b></a> presentation on PGA, Leo Dorst decided to upgrade
<b>Chapter 11</b> of the 2007 book <a href="http://geometricalgebra.net/" target="blank"><b>Geometric Algebra for Computer Science (GA4CS)</b></a> to treat these new developments in a similarly precise but accessible style.
</p>
<p>

The present text assumes some <b>basic geometric algebra</b> knowledge (though it could be read without that, as a motivational inspiration to acquire that knowledge). 
Throughout, we try to be no more mathematical than required, and provide <b>illustrations</b> and links to <b>software demonstrations</b>.
</p><p>

This text takes care to propagate <b>orientational signs</b> and <b>scaling factors</b> through all its operations, since the author believes that PGA allows for such a consistently <b>oriented Euclidean geometry</b>. 
Guessing signs afterwards should no longer be required...</p><p>

Enjoy! We plan to post updates on new developments on this page, and in upgraded versions of this '<a href="https://bivector.net/PGA4CS.pdf">Guided Tour to the Plane-Based Geometric Algebra PGA</a>'.</p><p>

        Memory-sensitive languages like C++ and Rust use compile-time information to calculate
        sizes of datatypes. These sizes are used to inform alignment, allocation, and calling conventions in ways
        that improve runtime performance. Modern languages in this setting support generic types, but so far
        these languages only allow parameterisation over types, not type constructors. In this article I describe
        how to enable parameterisation over arbitrary type constructs, while still retaining compile-time calculation
        of datatype sizes.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<h3 id="generics">Generics</h3>

<p>Many typed languages support some form of generic (parameterised) datatypes. This ability to abstract
over types is known as ‘parametric polymorphism’ (polymorphism for short). In Rust, for example, one
can define type of polymorphic pairs as <code>struct Pair&lt;A, B&gt;(fst: A, snd: B)</code>. In this definition, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are type 
variables (or type parameters), and can be substituted for other types: 
<code>Pair&lt;bool, bool&gt;</code>, <code>Pair&lt;bool, char&gt;</code>, and <code>Pair&lt;String, int32&gt;</code> are all valid pairs.</p>

<p>The name of a type, without any parameters, is known as a type constructor. <code>Pair</code> is not a type on its own; 
<code>Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code> (for some types <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>) is. The number of types required to ‘complete’ a type constructor is known
as its arity (so <code>Pair</code> has arity 2). The arity of a type constructor must always be respected; it’s an error to 
provide greater or fewer type parameters than are expected. For example, <code>Pair&lt;bool&gt;</code> and 
<code>Pair&lt;char, int32, String&gt;</code> are invalid.</p>

<h3 id="sizing">Sizing</h3>

<p>When using C++ or Rust, the compiler will calculate how many bytes of memory each datatype requires. Simple
types like <code>int32</code> and <code>bool</code> have a constant size; 4 bytes and 1 byte respectively. The size of datatypes 
built using of other simple types is easy to calculate. The simplest way to calculate the size of a struct 
is to sum the sizes of the fields, and the simplest way to calculate the size of an enum (or tagged union)
is to find the largest variant, and add 1 (for a tag byte). This is rarely the exact formula used by production
compilers, because they take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment">alignment</a> into account.
This article will assume the simple sizing formula, because the results can easily be adapted to more nuanced
formulae.</p>

<p>The size of a datatype like <code>struct TwoInts(x: int32, y: int32)</code> is known immediately at its definition. <code>TwoInts</code>
requires 8 bytes of memory. On the other hand, the size of a generic datatype is not always known at its definition.
What is the size of <code>struct Pair&lt;A, B&gt;(fst: A, snd: B)</code>? It’s the size of <code>A</code> plus the size of <code>B</code>, for some 
unknown <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>

<p>This difficulty is usually addressed by only generating code for datatypes and functions when all the generic
types have been replaced with concrete types. This process is known as monomorphisation. If the program contains a 
<code>Pair(true, true)</code>, then the compiler will generate
a new type <code>struct PairBoolBool(fst: bool, snd: bool)</code> whose size is statically known. If <code>Pair(true, true)</code>
is passed to a function <code>fn swap&lt;A, B&gt;(p: Pair&lt;A, B&gt;) -&gt; Pair&lt;B, A&gt;</code>, then the compiler generates a new
function <code>fn swapBoolBool(p: PairBoolBool) -&gt; PairBoolBool</code>. Because this new function only uses types with known
sizes, the code for memory allocation and calling conventions can be generated correctly.</p>

<p>There are also generic types that <em>don’t</em> depend on the size of their parameters. An example of
this is the pointer, commonly known in Rust as <code>Box&lt;A&gt;</code>. A pointer has the same size (often 4 or 8 bytes depending
on your CPU) regardless of what it points to. But in order to allocate a new pointer, the size of the item must
be known.</p>

<p>For each generic datatype or function, the compiler keeps track of which type variables are important for sizing
calculations. The specifics of this is discussed in the <a href="#type-classes">Type Classes</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>A consequence of all this is that in these languages, type variables can only stand for types. But there
are good reasons to have type variables that stand for type constructors, too:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>
  <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are some 1-arity container types. The only difference between these datatypes is the number of elements
they contain. They all support a <code>map</code> operation, which applies a function to all the datatype’s elements. Functions
that use <code>map</code> need to be implemented once for each type, even when their implementations are identical:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>incrOne</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>incrTwo</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Two</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Two</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>incrThree</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To remedy this, there must first be a way to abstract over the type constructors, so that the code can
be written <em>once</em> and for all:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>incr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>F</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>// when F&lt;A&gt; has map, for all types A</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, there must be some way to rule out invalid types. For example, replacing <code>F</code> with <code>bool</code> in <code>F&lt;int32&gt;</code>
is invalid, because <code>bool&lt;int32&gt;</code> is not a type. This is the job of kinds<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Kinds describe the ‘shape’ of types (and type constructors) in the same way that types describe the ‘shape’ 
of values. A type’s kind determines whether or not it takes any parameters. Here’s the syntax of kinds:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kind ::=
  Type
  kind -&gt; kind
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Types that take no arguments (like <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, and <code>String</code>) have kind <code>Type</code>. Types that take one argument,
like <code>One</code>, have kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>. In the code for <code>incr</code> above, <code>F</code> implicitly has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>. Types
that take more than one argument are represented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curried form</a>. This
means that <code>Two</code> has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>, not <code>(Type, Type) -&gt; Type</code>. <code>Three</code> has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>,
and so on.</p>

<p>Curried type constructors are standard in this setting, but not <em>necessary</em>. The results in this article could
also be applied to a setting with uncurried type constructors, at cost to expressiveness or implementation complexity.</p>

<p>Kinds put types and type constructors on equal footing. For the remainder of the article, both concepts will be
referred to as types. The kind becomes the distinguishing feature. For example, “type constructor of arity 2” would
be replaced by “type of kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>”.</p>

<p>Some final jargon: types with a kind other than <code>Type</code> are known as ‘higher-kinded types’, and parameterising
over higher-kinded types is known as ‘higher-kinded polymorphism’.</p>

<h3 id="type-classes">Type Classes</h3>

<p>Rust uses <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html">traits</a> to coordinate sizing calculations. Each
datatype implicitly receives an implementation of the <code>Sized</code> trait, and every type variable that is relevant for
a sizing calculation is given a <code>Sized</code> bound. This means that trait resolution, an already useful feature, can
be re-used to perform size calculations.</p>

<p>Closely related to traits is the functional programming concept of type classes<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. There are differences between the two,
but those differences don’t impact the results of this article. Type classes will prove a more convenient language
in which to discuss these ideas.</p>

<p>A type class (or trait) can be considered a predicate on types. A type class constraint (or trait bound) is an assertion
that the predicate must be true. For each constraint that is satisfied, there is corresponding ‘evidence’ that the
predicate is true.</p>

<p>When a type <code>T</code> has a <code>Sized</code> constraint, it is being asserted that the statement “<code>T</code> has a known size” is true. For
brevity, this will be written as <code>Sized T</code>. When this statement satisfied (for instance, when <code>T</code> is <code>int32</code>), the
evidence is produced is <em>the actual size</em> of <code>T</code> (when <code>Sized int32</code> is satisfied, the evidence
is the number <code>4</code> - the size of <code>int32</code>).</p>

<p>Generic types like <code>Two&lt;A&gt;</code> have a size that depends on their type parameter. In terms of constraints, it can
be said that <code>Sized A</code> <em>implies</em> <code>Sized Two&lt;A&gt;</code>. If <code>A</code> is <code>int32</code>, then its size is <code>4</code>, which implies that
<code>Two&lt;int32&gt;</code> has a size of <code>4 + 4 = 8</code>. Similarly, of <code>Pair</code> it can be said that <code>Sized A</code> implies [ <code>Sized B</code> implies 
<code>Sized Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code> ]. There is a choice between a curried an uncurried version; it could also be said that
[ <code>Sized A</code> <em>and</em> <code>Sized B</code> ] implies <code>Sized Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code>, but the curried version will be used for convenience.</p>

<p>Note that type <em>constructors</em> don’t have a size. In other words, only types of kind <code>Type</code> have a size. A type constructor
such as <code>Two</code> (of kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>) has a size <em>function</em>. Given the sizes of the type constructor’s parameters,
a size function computes the size of the resulting datatype. <code>Two</code>’s size function is <code>\a -&gt; a + a</code>. <code>Pair</code>’s size
function <code>\a -&gt; b -&gt; a + b</code> (it could also be <code>\(a, b) -&gt; a + b</code> in an uncurried setting).</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>

<p>With the background out of the way, the specific problem can be stated:</p>

<p>When a type of kind <code>Type</code> is relevant for a size calculation, it is given a <code>Sized</code> constraint, which will be
satisfied with a concrete size as evidence. What is the equivalent notion of constraint and evidence for
higher-kinded types that contribute to size calculations?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>An elegant solution to this problem can found by introducing quantified class constraints<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Quantified constraints 
are an extension to type classes that add implication and quantification to the language of constraints, and corresponding
notions of evidence.</p>

<p>Here’s new syntax of quantified size constraints:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>constraint ::=
  Sized type               (size constraint)
  constraint =&gt; constraint (implication constraint)
  forall A. constraint     (quantification constraint)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The evidence for a constraint <code>c1 =&gt; c2</code> is a function that takes evidence for <code>c1</code> and produces evidence for <code>c2</code>, and the
evidence for <code>forall A. c</code> is just the evidence for <code>c</code>. The evidence for quantification constraints is a bit more nuanced
in general, but this description is accurate when only …</p></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Previously we took a look at <a href="https://aeonlucid.com/Snapchat-detection-on-Android/">Snapchat’s root detection methods on Android</a>. This time we are taking a look at how they detect jailbreaks, tweaks and hooks on iOS.</p>



<p>All the research in this post is based on Snapchat 10.65.0.66 (832559634).</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_login_message.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>This is the message you see when you try to login with a detected tweak, although not all tweaks trigger this message. Two examples that trigger this message are <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.johncoates.flex3/">Flex 3</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/9baacc/release_wraith_snapchatphantom_replacement/">Wraith</a>. Some just flag your account and will get you banned later in a ban wave if you are unlucky.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-bans">Avoiding bans</h2>

<p>So obviously the first thing we want to look at is, what has the community tried so far to stay hidden? If you google around a bit you will most likely end up with these result. For a few of them, I will list the most notable features.</p>

<ul>
  <li>NoSub (or variants)
    <ul>
      <li>Disable Cydia Substrate / Substitute entirely for specific apps.</li>
      <li>Only if you can find an updated version and don’t want to use tweaks on Snapchat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/NepetaDev/UnSub/blob/master/Tweak/Tweak.xm">UnSub</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Hooks and filters libc file system calls.</li>
      <li>Spoofs the libc getenv to remove the <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> variable.</li>
      <li>Spoofs <code>_dyld_image_count</code> and <code>_dyld_get_image_name</code> to hide tweak related dylibs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jjolano/shadow/blob/master/Tweak.xm">Shadow</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Too much to list.. it hooks way too much.</li>
      <li>Still misses lots of stuff for Snapchat specifically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/jailbroken-iphone">Snapchat themselves recommend NoSub</a>..</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_snapchat_jailbroken_support.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>But it seems that nobody knows what Snapchat is <strong>exactly</strong> doing to detect everything. Which is why I am writing this post. Only one that I have seen <a href="https://twitter.com/cokepokes/status/1023114963550797824">publicly making efforts</a> to figure this out is the developer of Phantom, CokePokes.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-they-doing-it">How are they doing it?</h2>

<p>I will try my best to explain every check they do in Snapchat 10.65.0.66.</p>

<p>When you launch the app they create a new thread using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html">pthread_create</a> that runs all the checks. At the end of these checks an integer is stored with flags of everything that was detected on the device. Some of these checks are then ran every 31 seconds.</p>

<p>All the code executed for these checks is obfuscated with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strong-codes">Snapchats in-house obfuscation tools</a> and thus very annoying to look at using tools such as IDA.</p>

<h3 id="code-signature-checks">Code signature checks</h3>

<p>One of the first things they do is checking and storing stuff from the code signature. This happens using the <code>sys_csops(169)</code> syscall, which is pretty much undocumented but is very similar to the code here.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They execute the following operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_ENTITLEMENTS_BLOB</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The most important one of this is the <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code>, this retrieves the current codesigning status of the process. A jailbroken device can respond with messy status flags. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_GET_TASK_ALLOW</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_INSTALLER</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_PLATFORM_BINARY</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DEBUGGED</code> (Process was debugged / is being debugged)</li>
  <li>Or missing <code>CS_VALID</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A normal device would have these flags:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_VALID</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_HARD</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_KILL</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_ENFORCEMENT</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_REQUIRE_LV</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DYLD_PLATFORM</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_SIGNED</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For all available flags and their descriptions, see <a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/BUILD/obj/EXPORT_HDRS/osfmk/kern/cs_blobs.h.html#_M/CS_VALID">this page</a>.</p>

<p>The result of <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code> and <code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code> are stored and later sent to the Snapchat servers, encrypted.</p>

<h3 id="bundle-check">Bundle check</h3>

<p>This is a simple check but quite effective if not noticed by a tweak developer. Pseudo code looks like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x0 = CFBundleGetMainBundle()
x1 = CFBundleGetIdentifier(x0)
x2 = CFStringGetCStringPtr(x1)
strncmp("com.toyopagroup.picaboo", x2)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dyld-check">Dyld check</h3>

<p>Snapchat has two methods to iterate all loaded dylibs.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h4>

<p>One way is using <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L48">dyld_get_image_header</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dladdr1.3.html">dladdr</a>. They iterate over <code>dyld_get_image_header</code> until it returns null and checks if it has seen everything with <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L47">dyld_image_count</a>. The <code>dladdr</code> method provides them with the path of the dylib. These are checked against a few unknown strings but removing everything substrate related from the dyld list fixes this check.</p>

<h4 id="second-attempt">Second attempt</h4>

<p>The other method they use is calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1537934-task_info">task_info</a> with flavor <code>TASK_DYLD_INFO</code>. This also gives them a list of all loaded dylibs and must be fixed separately from the first dyld check.</p>

<h3 id="file-system-checks">File system checks</h3>

<p>There are a couple of file system checks, of which all use the <code>sys_access(33)</code> syscall.</p>

<h4 id="first-list">First list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/Library/Application Support/PhLite/phlite.bundle/AuthAPI.pem</li>
  <li>/private/var/tmp/cydia.log</li>
  <li>/bin/bash</li>
  <li>/usr/sbin/sshd</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/ssh-keysign</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/sftp-server</li>
  <li>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</li>
  <li>/.installed_yaluX</li>
  <li>/Library/LaunchDaemons/dropbear.plist</li>
  <li>/usr/local/bin/dropbear</li>
  <li>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/enable-dylibs-to-override-cache</li>
  <li>/.cydia_no_stash</li>
  <li>/var/log/jailbreakd-stdout.log</li>
  <li>/etc/motd</li>
  <li>/usr/lib/libsubstitute.dylib</li>
  <li>/var/tmp/slide.txt</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="second-list">Second list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Ghay</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Snapchat.crc</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/embedded.mobileprovision</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="last-one-and-expected-to-exist">Last one (and expected to exist)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/PlugIns</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one makes it a bit harder to fix, since you can not simply replace the arm instructions with something that makes it always return false. Thus requiring an inline hook as replacement for the syscall so you gain full control over it.</p>

<h3 id="obj-c---class-checks">Obj-C - Class checks</h3>

<p>A lot of classes are checked from a lot of different tweaks. This is done using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a>.</p>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-checks">Obj-C - Method checks</h3>

<p>They also check methods. This happens using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a> and then <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418530-class_getinstancemethod">class_getInstanceMethod</a>. If any exists, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NSMutableString</code>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-integrity-checks">Obj-C - Method integrity checks</h3>

<p>Next up is Snapchats own methods. For the classes listed below they first call <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418490-class_copymethodlist">class_copyMethodList</a>. Then for every <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/method?language=objc">Method</a> they check if the <code>IMP</code> pointer (address of the function) is within its own <code>__text</code> segment. This is how they detect whether a method has been hooked.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SCAppDelegate</code></li>
  <li><code>MainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatViewControllerV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCScreenshotDetector</code></li>

  <li><code>SCOperaPageViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCLoginService</code></li>
  <li><code>SCAdsHoldoutExperimentContext</code></li>

  <li><code>SCChatTypingHandler</code></li>
  <li><code>Story</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMessageV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOperaViewersLayer</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to <code>dzan</code> for telling me to check the <code>__text</code> segment. :-)</p>

<h3 id="symbol-checks">Symbol checks</h3>

<p>They also check for a couple of symbols using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a>. If the result is not null, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>MSHookMessageEx</code></li>
  <li><code>MSHookFunction</code></li>
  <li><code>_Z17replaced_readlinkPKcPcm</code></li>
  <li><code>hooksArray</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_METACLASS_$__xxx</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_CLASS_$_PHSSaverV2</code></li>
  <li><code>plist</code></li>
  <li><code>flexBreakPoint</code></li>
  <li><code>convert_coordinates_from_device_to_interface</code></li>
  <li><code>OBJC_METACLASS_$_DzSnapHelper</code></li>
  <li><code>ChKey2</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="symbol-hook-checks">Symbol hook checks</h3>

<p>A few symbols are resolved using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a> to check whether they have been hooked. They first resolve <code>dlsym</code> using <code>dlsym</code>.. yeah.. That result gets used for the <code>dlsym</code> of the symbols below. For every address returned, the first 4 bytes are checked for common hook related instructions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>dlsym</code></li>
  <li><code>objc_getClass</code></li>
  <li><code>class_getInstanceMethod</code></li>
  <li><code>sel_registerName</code></li>
  <li><code>class_copyMethodList</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_image_count</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_get_image_header</code></li>
  <li><code>dladdr</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h3>

<p>I need to be honest, this is a very annoying way how they check for injection because it is annoying to fix. Instead of using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getenv.3.html">getenv</a> they use the <a href="http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=posix/environ.c">environ</a> variable. Since it is a variable, you can not “hook” it.</p>

<p>At least the following variables are detected.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/TweakInject.dylib</code></li>
  <li><code>_MSSafeMode=0</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sandbox-check">Sandbox check</h3>

<p>Probably not an issue for anyone.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_sandbox.png" alt="iOS sandbox">
</p>

<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>Not much detection done here but still relevant, using <code>sys_sysctl(202)</code> they request at least the following properties.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>kern.version</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.osversion</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.proc.pid.&lt;PID&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>hw.machine</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>The syscall <code>sys_proc_info(33)</code> is also called a couple of times, which could reveal stuff that is ptracing the process. They also use <code>sys_open(5)</code>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>, <code>sys_close(6)</code> and <code>sys_lstat64(340)</code> on the <code>Snapchat</code> binary. Probably to check for modifications or generating a checksum.</p>

<h2 id="how-all-this-stuff-was-found">How all this stuff was found</h2>

<p>A lot of the work was done using a small iOS emulator build on top of <a href="https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn">Unicorn</a>. Using an emulator you can see everything they do. Building this was also teached me a lot about the CoreFoundation library of iOS.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_emulator.png" alt="iOS emulator">
</p>

<p>Later I implemented a counter for all of my discoveries in a tweak called <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> while carefully keeping track of how my changes modified the detection flags and slowly getting rid of all of them. You can easily find fixes for checks mentioned in this blog post in the “Detections” directory.</p>

<p>You could alternatively trace the syscalls using any of the methods discussed in the WhoYouGonnaSyscall talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/hexploitable">Hexploitable</a>. Slides of the talk can be found <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/r2con2019/blob/master/talks/WhoYouGonnaSyscall/Hex-r2con2019-WhoYouGonnaSyscall.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-story-on-how-i-wasted-hours-on-fixing-syscalls">A story on how I wasted hours on fixing syscalls</h3>

<p>Let’s take <code>sys_access(33)</code> as an example. It’s implementation looks like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/access.2.html">this</a>. In short, when a file exists and permission is granted, return <code>0</code>. Otherwise return <code>-1</code>. First thing I did was force both of the results in my emulator but I saw no changes happening to the detection flags.</p>

<p>Later when implementing a fix for this in the <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> tweak, I was unable to have it fail. The arm instructions look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>MOV             X0, X27 ; path
MOV             X1, #0  ; mode
MOV             X16, #0x21
SVC             0x80    ; SYS_access
MOV             X0, #0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
CSEL            X0, X0, XZR, CS
MOV             X27, X0 ; Use result
</code></pre></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I was recently asked to look over some CVs. It’s a while since I’ve done this, so I thought that noting down my immediate reactions as I went through the CVs might help anyone having to circulate their own CV at the moment.</p>

<!--snip-->

<p><img src="https://youknowfordevs.com/images/uploads/christopher-sardegna-iRyGmA_no2Q-unsplash.jpg" alt="Photo by Christopher Sardegna on Unsplash"></p>

<p>I’m not for a moment saying I’m right or wrong in the following views, and this is definitely not one of those posts about ‘how to write your CV to land your dream job’. I’m merely laying out the responses I had and more importantly what I felt these reponses told me about the person behind the CV. My ‘gut reaction’ may well be similar to others’ and if they are, it might be worth bearing them in mind when you share your CV.</p>

<h2 id="looks-count-more-than-i-thought">Looks Count More Than I Thought</h2>

<p>First, it wasn’t until I reached the ninth CV that I realised how much a CV’s appearance makes a difference. When viewing numbers one to eight I hadn’t been thinking ‘these look terrible’, but when I reached the ninth, a part of my brain said: ‘Finally! A CV that looks good.’</p>

<p>I think if the role was for a C++ programmer then I probably would have simply smiled to myself, ignored my response, and moved on. That’s not to say that appearance doesn’t matter–or that C++ programmers don’t worry about their appearance–but if I was trying to decide between two C++ programmers it wouldn’t be the look of their CV that was the deciding factor.</p>

<p>But the role for which I was reviewing this batch of CVs was a React developer and there are lots of very talented React developers out there. And when lots of people have worked with GraphQL and Docker and cloud services and D3 then it may well come down to whether or not you have made an effort to convey that you like things to ‘look nice’.</p>

<p>It’s worth saying too that the CVs that looked good didn’t go overboard; all they did was have a pleasing font, perhaps two columns instead of one for the layout, maybe a couple of icons and some colour, and probably didn’t span more than a couple of pages. But that was enough to convince me that these were people who would ensure that a bad-looking product didn’t get deployed.</p>

<h2 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</h2>

<p>Probably in the same vein, typos really jump out at you when you are looking at a lot of CVs. Again I’m not saying I’m right or wrong on whether this should be an important criteria, but the fact that my subconcscious reaction was to be turned off if I saw a spelling mistake–or a technology name that had been capitalised incorrectly–shows that somewhere in our psyches this stuff counts for something.</p>

<p>As with the previous point about looks, I’d probably see this as more relevant for front-end people.</p>

<p>And it might be worth saying that it’s usually not difficult to differentiate between those who have just not bothered to check their CV and those that have difficulty with spelling. I’ve worked with people in the latter camp, both senior managers and junior programmers, and it’s not a big deal–you can work with it and it would not stop me from hiring someone.</p>

<p>But to keep with the theme of my ‘initial reaction’, I can’t help that when I see someone write ‘Graphql’ I’m going to doubt whether the applicant really has that much experience with ‘GraphQL’; maybe it’s worth just double-checking the website of the technologies you use one last time, before sending off that CV.</p>

<h2 id="approaches-v-technologies">Approaches v. Technologies</h2>

<p>One other thing that I hadn’t expected was that I was drawn to mark people more highly if they gave some indication of the <em>approach</em> they took to their coding and development. For example, a few people mentioned having experience with TDD, which I thought was good. That doesn’t mean I’d rule out someone who didn’t have TDD experience, but it’s an approach that people need to be aware of.</p>

<p>However, more importantly than TDD, only a handful indicated that they liked to get involved in code reviews and saw them as a good way to share knowledge and build a consistent and high quality codebase. Again, I would not rule out someone who didn’t mention code reviews, mentoring, and so on, provided they were relatively inexperienced; but I probably <em>would</em> rule out someone who clearly has experience, but hasn’t thought to mention these things.</p>

<h3 id="approach-from-technologies">Approach From Technologies</h3>

<p>What I was also surprised by was how the list of technologies on a person’s CV led to me forming an impression of the kind of coder that person was. If I saw GraphQL in the mix then I found myself thinking ‘modern tech stack’. It may be unfair, especially since GraphQL wasn’t mentioned in the job description that was circulated; but after reviewing all of the CVs I found that it was a pretty accurate indicator of the types of projects someone had been involved in.</p>

<p>There were other technologies that were similarly indicative, such as mention of ‘microservices’, or use of MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, and so on. But there were very few CVs where these technologies appeared without GraphQL.</p>

<p>There is probably no general rule here, since the technologies that differentiate will be different in each cohort of CVs; if every CV included GraphQL then it may have been the presence of something like Docker and/or Kubernetes that told you something about the kind of people you were looking at.</p>

<h2 id="public-profile">Public Profile</h2>

<p>This last point may also be controversial, but I’m going to describe it so that you can do whatever you like with the information; if someone was not on LinkedIn or didn’t have a public Git account, I found myself thinking ‘well, what exactly do they do?’</p>

<p>From this batch of 22 CVs, only one had answered any questions on Stack Overflow, and only one–a different person–had done any talks at Meetups. A couple had GitHub accounts, a couple were on LinkedIn and a couple had blogs.</p>

<p>This is no doubt unfair, so again, blame my subconscious. But I can’t help think that if I’m going to work with some people day after day, I want to be with people that are sharing links to things they’ve read, people who are trying out new technologies and languages, people who have weekend projects, or who are contributing bug fixes back to open source projects.</p>

<p>And although I’m not particularly a big fan of LinkedIn, I always quite like it when I see people who are at the early stages of their career making connections with everyone they met at last night’s Meetup.</p>

<p>None of this is to ignore the current discussion about work/life balance–to demand that people do their own education in their own time, spend all waking hours coding, attend Meetups every night of the week. But it is to recognise that we are in a fast-moving industry, and if you want your CV to be picked from amongst that batch of 22, then it’s going to be important to think about how you come across.</p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

<p>One final thing has just occurred to me…I didn’t consider the qualifications of <em>anyone</em>, which I imagine is down to the role that the CVs were for. You’d certainly be interested in degrees and PhDs if you were hiring a data scientist or someone to write an operating system; in these spaces theory is a major element. But for fast-moving technologies like front-end development, you can probably tell everything about a person from their experience.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I haven’t had to look at CVs for quite a while, so it was interesting to examine my own responses to reviewing this batch. What became clear is that I quickly ‘merged’ the CV and the person in my mind. If there were mistakes in the CV I couldn’t help but imagine someone who lacked attention to detail. If there was a little bit of colour in the CV or the person had spoken at a Meetup then I couldn’t help but think that this was a person who was prepared to go the extra mile. And if the person had a public Git account then my spontaneous reaction was that this was someone who wanted to keep learning, and really enjoyed the work they do.</p>

<p>I may be wrong in my judgements or harsh in my conclusions, but if you’re about to send your CV out, at least you now have a couple more insights that might help you decide how your CV is representing you.</p>

            <p>I was always a fan of the steampunk style, and having also had experience building steam engines in the past, there was only one real direction this project could go. Once I had my radiation detector kit hooked up to my Raspberry Pi running InfluxDB and Grafana, I found myself woodworking, machining, and fabricobbling an enclosure out of mahogany, brass, copper, toggle switches and, because it just had to be done, nixie tubes.</p>

<p>Read the story of the almost year-long journey (<em>cough</em> some other stuff cropped up…) I went on to make my steampunk vision a reality below, and if you want to get up and running quickly, find out how to <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-simple-radiation-monitor-using-a-raspberry-pi-influxdb-and-grafana/">build your own simple version right here</a>!</p>

<h2 id="introductionspanidintrospan">Introduction <span id="intro"></span></h2>

<p>Low cost radiation monitors and Geiger counter kits have been available online for around $30-50US/£25-45 for a while, but standing alone they don’t do much other than make the recognizable “clicking” sound we all know from movies and TV. I decided to up the ante by connecting one to a Raspberry Pi, storing the data with InfluxDB, and showing the readings with a Grafana dashboard.</p>



<p>I updated the tech, gave it a web interface, added remote management, and built a custom mahogany housing with brass and copper fittings to show everything off, because it’s important to look suitably <em>hip</em> when sitting on the desk next to your <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-raspberry-pi-powered-train-station-oled-sign-for-your-desk/">train sign</a>… right?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/header.jpg" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(58)">  
</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m gonna show what I built to hopefully provide some inspiration, then show you how to get up and running with a simpler version of the project that anyone can build at home without any special tools. Let’s hit this.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="inspirationdesignspanidinspirationspan">Inspiration &amp; design <span id="inspiration"></span></h2>

<p>I’ve always found the idea of radiation fascinating; how there are invisible particles moving around at incredibly high speeds, crashing into things and flipping bits all around us. Due to my fascination, it doesn’t take a lot to capture my interest when it comes to this field.</p>

<p>One day last year I was reminiscing over the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44606771">now defunct</a> UK-based electronics retailer Maplin, and how they sold all sorts of interesting kits for the aspiring engineer. This led me to <a href="https://www.richardmudhar.com/blog/2019/09/maplin-geiger-counter/">Richard Mudhar’s blog</a> where he tells the story of the <em>Maplin Geiger Counter</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/mudhar-example.png" alt="An excerpt and image from Richard Mudhar's post"></p>

</figure>

<p>The kit that Richard has built above features both an electromechanical counter on the left, and two rings of LEDs reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekatron">dekatron tubes</a> on the right. This display has the neat design feature that as the rate of count increases, the display becomes more noticeable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/dekatron.gif" alt=""></p>

</figure>

<p>I liked the idea of combining the modern technology on the inside (Raspberry Pi, Grafana, etc.) with the timeless look of brass, copper, toggle switches, dark hardwood, and glass on the outside. The idea was now to build something that looked old and had that distinctive steampunk style, but was up to date and Internet-connected.</p>

<p>In addition to the total absolute count like the old Maplin counter, I wanted to offer a live display of the counts per minute (CPM) reading, and what better way to do this than with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">Nixie tubes</a>, to get that nice warm orange glow and keep things looking cosy.</p>

<p>I started scribbling down ideas and thoughts of materials I wanted to use alongside shopping lists for parts, and possible designs for the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/notes.jpg" alt="Original shop notes!"></p>

<figure>  
Notes don’t survive well in a machine shop, but these are what’s left of my original sketches.  
</figure>

<p>This process was very much led by an image I had in my mind about how the thing should look and feel and so I just had to make it real… somehow.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="thebuildspanidbuildspan">The build <span id="build"></span></h2>

<p>With some thoughts and ideas scribbled down it was time to get started. As this is for the most part going to be a bespoke, hand-built item, and made up as I go along, it’s not necessary to put everything in CAD. There are of course some core items that exist already and cannot change size; the Raspberry Pi and radiation detector board, for example. These are off-the-shelf parts that have to fit in the box no matter what, and start to dictate the size of the final unit.</p>

<p>Almost all other parts are completely hand made, machined and fabricated. This was necessitated by the desire to make everything authentic; I didn’t want to build things just for looks, I wanted any design choices made for aesthetic reasons to also be functional; by this I mean when I put 18 screws in something to make it look good, they are going to be 18 <em>real</em> screws that you have to take out to gain access!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Each of the build log images link to a separate gallery when clicked. You can look through the images that way if you prefer, or read on in full detail.</p>

<h3 id="thefrontpanelspanidpanelspan">The front panel <span id="panel"></span></h3>

<p>I started with the front panel of the housing, I knew I wanted two toggle switches; one for power and one for sound (to disable the clicking noise), along with 3 nixie tubes to display the CPM up to 999. Normal background radiation is in the range of about 25-75 CPM, so I figured if background radiation is above 999 CPM, we have bigger problems than worrying about enough digits on the counter.</p>



<p>The two front panel pieces are made from 6mm thick mild steel plate, cut to size with an angle grinder and then milled to dimension with the help of Bridget, the Bridgeport. Holes are then cut for the nixies and the toggle switches.</p>



<p>I manufactured labels for each by hand-punching lettering into 0.5mm thick brass sheet, polishing and fixing with M2 screws. The steel pieces are coated with a clear lacquer to prevent corrosion.</p>

<h3 id="workingwithwoodspanidwoodspan">Working with wood <span id="wood"></span></h3>

<p>Wood isn’t my favourite material to work with, I mean it just changes shape of its own accord! Who can work with that?! Anyhow, it’s very pretty, and so it was decided that the outer box should be made of hardwood. I started with a scrap piece of mahogany, cut it to halve the thickness on the bandsaw, and then set about planing and shaping the sides of the box to fit the dimensions of the Raspberry Pi (3A+) and the radiation detector.</p>



<p>The dimensions of the front panel along with the steel faceplates were planned out in Fusion 360 so that I could print a cutting and drilling template. This was taped onto the planed piece of mahogany, the holes for screws were drilled, and the openings for components cut out.</p>



<p>The pieces were cut at 45 degree angles to enable a mitre joint in each corner. The joints were reinforced with biscuits (mmm biscuits), and then the 4 sides were glued and clamped and allowed to cure overnight.</p>



<p>The top and bottom of the case are made from the same scrap mahogany, but planed a lot thinner - approximately 6mm, the same as the steel plate.</p>

<h3 id="topbrassspanidbrassspan">Top brass <span id="brass"></span></h3>

<p>I had the idea that it would look good to hold the box together with a totally unnecessary amount of screws, 36 to be exact; 18 on top and 18 on the bottom. To prevent the screws damaging the wood surface and to add some extra detail to the top of the case I decided to make a brass plate that the screws all go through to clamp the top cover down.</p>



<p>Some pieces of 2mm brass strip were cut, mitred on the corners and soldered together. Once soldered, sanded and polished, the joints are barely visible.</p>



<p>Holes for screws were then drilled, and the brass plate used to secure the oversize lid to the box whilst it was sanded to size on a drum sander. I later learned that using a drum sander for this was a mistake as it marked the sides of the box, but you live and learn!</p>

<h3 id="imitationdekatronsspaniddekatronsspan">Imitation Dekatrons <span id="dekatrons"></span></h3>

<p>My attempt at imitating the Dekatron tube effect starts with a piece of 50mm stainless steel (or aluminium) bar. The bar is turned on a lathe down to 40mm, and to have a cavity for the electronics. The work is removed from the lathe and parted off on a bandsaw before being returned to the lathe to have a hole drilled in the rear for cabling to drive the LEDs.</p>



<p>The part is then put on the milling machine to have 10 holes drilled and M2 <del>taps snapped off in the holes</del> threaded ready to fasten the faceplate.</p>



<p>The brass faceplate is made from the same 0.5mm thick brass sheet as the labels from the faceplates. Each piece is drilled with 20 holes (10 for LEDs, 10 for fasteners), and then hand stamped with the numbering for each LED.</p>

The wired LED faceplate ready to be screwed into the housing.  
</figure>  
</div>

<p>The LEDs are wired with a common ground and connected using a piece of recycled floppy disk drive ribbon cable. All the work is then carried out a second time for the ‘X10’ display. The eagle-eyed readers will notice that the second display is made from a different material than the first - this is due to the fact I snapped both a drill bit and a tap off in the M2 holes - working with stainless steel with these small tools is very difficult! I ended up making the second from aluminium, which machines like butter, in comparison.</p>



<p>Throughout the development of this project I found myself continually swapping fasteners and trying different combinations to see what looks best. The end result is a mix of M2 and M3 metric machine screws in both brass and stainless steel, cheese head and countersunk head, all slotted. You may notice that in earlier photos some of the parts were assembled with Allen-head cap screws but these were later swapped out. Ebay is usually a great place to get small quantities of fasteners of all different shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>Until today, there were two major road blocks: you had to get access to a process design kit (PDK) from a chip manufacturing house (a foundry), and you had to have enough money to actually pay for the manufacturing.
These times are over.
Today.</p>

<p>Today, in a FOSSi Dial-Up talk, Tim Ansell of Google announced <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">SkyWater PDK</a>, the first manufacturable, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit">process design kit</a>.
What differentiates this PDK from previous attempts is the fact that it is manufacturable: with this PDK, you can actually produce chips with the <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/">SkyWater foundry</a> in the 130nm node.</p>

<p>That leaves you as chip designer only with one road block: money.
Manufacturing chips is expensive – even for more than a decade old nodes like the 130nm node, you need to spend at least a couple thousand dollars.</p>

<p>You know what?
Don’t worry – Google and efabless have got you covered!
They are providing <strong>completely free of cost</strong> chip manufacturing runs: one in November this year, and multiple more in 2021.
All open source chip designs qualify, no further strings attached!</p>

<p>Learn more about all of that by re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EczW2IWdnOM">Tim’s Dial-Up talk</a> or click through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtwZPc8ykkkgtUkHkoJZrP9jKOo3FYdKqbg-So0ic6_kx7ha1vHnxrWmuxWkTc9GfC8xl0TfEpMLwK/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">slides</a>.</p>

<p>This is certainly a dream come true for us at the FOSSi Foundation.
We helped the Free and Open Source Silicon community, our community, grow and tackle huge challenges over the years.
An open, manufacturable PDK was the main blocker in a fully open flow between RTL and a physical chip, and we’re extremely excited to see that blocker removed.</p>

<p>As always, removing one roadblock only highlights more challenges:
RAM, ROM and flash compilers, analog blocks, optimizations to various tools, and much, much more.
Now is the perfect time to get involved in the Free and Open Source Silicon ecosystem – or learn more about the accomplishments and challenges ahead of us.
A good starting point are the next Dial-Up talks.</p>

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-datetime.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>Gates was having an informal meeting with Steve Shaiman, a cheerful gnome of a man with a head of frizzy hair who was general manager of Microsoft’s hardware division, and with Raleigh Roark one of the two people who had started the division. They were talking about fonts and applications, especially Word.</p>

<p>Roark gave Gates his answer: For printers, basically. This was the era of desktop publishing and proliferating office applications, and users needed more than just the bitmapped system fonts on their computers to get their work done. Courier, Tms Rmn, and Helv were not going to be enough. </p>

<p>Bill Gates is known for asking hard questions, but also for accepting hard answers and acting on them. As soon as he got his answer, he pointed at Steve and told him: “Now you run type!”</p>

<p>That’s the way things worked at Microsoft in those days, says Shaiman: whoever knew the most about a subject tended to end up in charge of it. So he ended up starting Microsoft’s first fonts group. It was Spring, 1989.</p>

				<h2>The conquest of TrueType</h2>
			</section>
			
			<section data-blockname="body_copy">
				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-phone.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN was on a business trip to Atlanta with Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft’s celebrated head of advanced technology, when they got an unexpected phone call. Myhrvold had with him a satellite phone—an early mobile phone, “which in those days,” as Shaiman put it, “meant something you’d carry in a suitcase.” The unexpected call was from Apple.</p>

<p>At that time, Adobe Systems dominated the digital font market, with its PostScript technology built into Apple’s LaserWriter printers, and with PostScript firmly established as the preferred format for high-quality fonts. Microsoft needed to find its own format and its own fonts if it didn’t want to be dependent on Adobe.</p>

<p>Like Microsoft, Apple was trying to find ways to license the PostScript language from Adobe, or to find an alternative. The Apple call was about font technology: Apple was developing its own font format, TrueType, as an alternative to PostScript, while Microsoft acquired a program called TrueImage, a potential PostScript clone, which Apple was interested in. How about a trade?</p>

<p>Shaiman says that his and Nathan Myhrvold’s reaction was immediate: “Sure!”</p>

<p>Ironically, once Microsoft got hold of TrueType, they loved the concept but didn’t like the way it was implemented. Although they ended up only making slight modifications to the version that shipped with Windows 3.1, when it came time for the next version of Windows, they ended up “throwing out Apple’s code and rewriting it from scratch.”</p>

<p>When Microsoft and Apple publicly announced their collaboration on TrueType at the Seybold conference in September 1989, the announcement was handled in a contentious and aggressive manner that antagonized Adobe and famously brought Adobe’s John Warnock to tears of frustration. Steve Shaiman feels now that it was a poor way to do it: “We couldn’t have done worse.” Although they were demonstrating what they felt was better technology, they made the mistake of shoving it in Adobe’s face. “What we really needed,” he says, “was a good PR person who could have helped us come up with a less aggressive approach.” But the deed was done. The “font wars” were in full swing.</p>

<p>The key developer of Microsoft’s new code was Eliyezer Kohen, whom Myhrvold met at a conference in Switzerland. Eliyezer was, as Steve Shaiman put it, “really, really smart.” He had a PhD from ETH Zurich, where he studied with Hans Eduard Meyer, the designer of the font Syntax, and Niklaus Wirth, designer of the Pascal language; and he developed his own technology for creating scalable fonts. Eliyezer, according to Shaiman, was “a Turkish Jew with a German wife, who wanted to move to the United States, as one or the other of them wasn’t welcome in any country in Europe where they might find decent working conditions.” Microsoft happily brought him in.</p>

				<h2>Even a DOS screen needs a font</h2>

			<section data-blockname="body_copy">
				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-dosscreen.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>GREG HITCHCOCK was one of the early members of what he calls the “virtual team” that Shaiman and Dennis Adler put together in early 1990 to deal with fonts. Hitchcock is tall, blond, and slow-spoken; he doesn’t fit the image of the high-energy Microsoft employee, and he may seem unassertive, almost tentative, if you see him only in a neutral context. But when you see his attention snap to the subjects he knows and cares about, he is forceful and precise, and very, very knowledgeable. His memory is encyclopedic, and he has been at the heart of Microsoft’s typographic development for more than a quarter century. Today he manages Microsoft’s Advanced Reading Technologies (ART) team.</p>

<p>Although Microsoft had been dealing with fonts in one way or another from the very beginning (even a DOS screen needs a font to display its text), Hitchcock feels that the story of typography at Microsoft really begins here: When the first outline fonts were created for Windows 3.1, in 1990.</p>

<p>It was all brand-new technology. All fonts up until then had been bitmap fonts, crude forms made up of coarse screen pixels in a vague approximation of what real letters looked like. Although Microsoft’s new effort was driven by purely practical needs—mapping the screen fonts on a computer system to the fonts available on a printer—Hitchcock feels that it was also the beginning of thinking about screen fonts as something useful and readable in themselves.</p>

<p>The members of the virtual team came from all over Microsoft: Dennis Adler (Fonts), Jean-François Peyroux (OS/2, and later Windows), Michel Suignard (Windows International), Greg Hitchcock (OS/2), Eliyezer Kohen (Fonts), David Weise (Windows), Tim McCaffery (Windows), Raleigh Roark (Hardware), Gabe Newell (Printing), and later Ben Bauermeister, an outside consultant, whose “PANOSE system” for classifying typefaces by their visual characteristics (rather than their historical roots) might provide a roadmap between screen and print.</p>

				<h2>Monotype send out S.O.S.</h2>

			<section data-blockname="body_copy">
				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-shake.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN hired Dennis Adler to manage the fonts groups.&nbsp; Together, they talked with several potential sources of font libraries and font technologies, including most of the big guns in the field. Linotype, the venerable manufacturer of hot-metal typesetting equipment, which owned the rights to, among others, the very popular typeface Helvetica, was being hard-nosed. “Fonts were seen as incredibly valuable at the time,” says Shaiman, “and Linotype’s attitude was, ‘What’s Microsoft going to do for us?’” So they were asking an enormous price for licensing the fonts. And Microsoft didn’t want to license the fonts; it wanted to own the rights. (When Shaiman told me this, he laughed and proclaimed: “Microsoft doesn’t rent things!”)</p>

<p>Monotype, on the other hand, was much more receptive. Monotype was Linotype’s great rival; between them, the two companies had essentially created the business of mechanical typesetting in the late 19th century, with their competing hot-metal composition machines. But the Monotype Corporation had fallen on hard times. The typography division, the only part of the company working on digital fonts, was making money, but the larger machinery business was hemorrhaging cash, and the parent company was about to declare bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Out of that debacle rose a new type-only company, Monotype Typography Ltd, which was essentially the old typography division reconstituted as an independent business.</p>

<p>The new company, with its focus on digital fonts and information technology, was headed by a German, Rene Kerfante, who had joined Monotype in 1987 to head up the typography division, and an American, Ira Mirochnik, who had been Monotype’s chief financial officer. They were both quite ready to negotiate a deal with Microsoft.</p>

<p>So it was Monotype that began developing a set of “core fonts” for Microsoft: Scalable TrueType fonts that could be shipped with Windows and used freely by every Windows customer. The new fonts had to mimic the established core set of PostScript fonts, which included Times Roman and Helvetica. Since Monotype had originally developed the Times fonts back in the hot-metal days, that part was easy. To compete with Helvetica, though, they chose to adapt an earlier Monotype design with similar characteristics, called Arial.</p>

<p>Designing the outlines for these typefaces was the kind of task that the Monotype drawing office excelled at. The hard part was the hinting, the software instructions that control the rendering on various devices. That was what would make the fonts look good on screen.</p>

<p>Monotype had a team in the UK working on font hinting, but they were running into trouble. Although they had an auto-hinting program, called TypeMan, developed by Apple’s principal TrueType developer, Sampo Kaasila, the process was proving to be long, slow, and laborious. As Greg Hitchcock describes it, Monotype in desperation Monotype “sent out the bat signal.” In response, in September 1990, he and Eliyezer made the first of many trips to the UK to provide hands-on help and supervision. This was the start of a back-and-forth pattern for Greg—three weeks in the UK, one week in Redmond—that lasted for the next nine months. Their main job was hinting type, working in little rooms in archaic buildings at the old Monotype works. …</p></section></article></div>

Still can't bear the sticker shock of your very own Talos II, or even a itty bitty Blackbird? Why not do what we all do for the machines we can't own and emulate one instead? (And then decide you like it a lot, and save your pennies?)
</p><p>
QEMU 5.0.0 offers a machine model for the bare-metal PowerNV profile, to which the Raptor systems and other OpenPOWER POWER8 and POWER9 designs intended for Linux (i.e., not PowerVM machines) belong. Using the Talos II firmware image (mostly: one snag to be mentioned), you can boot the machine in QEMU and from there bring up an operating system in emulation. In this article we'll prove it works by bringing up <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power</a> (hi, Daniel!) in a variety of configurations. A set-up like this might be enough to test that your software or open-source package builds and runs on OpenPOWER, even if you don't own one yet. In a future article we'll talk about how you can boot your own code on the metal so you can port your favourite OS or build a unikernel.
</p><p>
(For the purposes of this article I'll assume an audience that isn't as familiar with OpenPOWER terminology as our usual readership. Kindly humour me.)
</p><p>
The emulation is imperfect, both if you're emulating it on a real Raptor family system or on an icky PC. While QEMU can emulate an AST2500 (i.e., the ARM-based Baseboard Management Controller, which acts as the service processor and provides the video framebuffer), and QEMU can also emulate a PowerNV system, it doesn't do both at the same time. That means the very lowest levels are actually being simulated here -- you can't watch Raptor's pretty Hostboot display, for example, and only the barest functions of the BMC are simulated enough to allow bring-up, not including the framebuffer. In fact, the hardware profiles we will use here do not in general match a real Raptor system either: we're just virtually plugging in PCI devices that give us necessary functionality, though of course none of the peripheral devices in a Raptor system is Raptor-proprietary. Finally, even though I have tagged this entry with KVM, KVM currently doesn't work right with the QEMU PowerNV machine model even though I'm pretty sure it should be technically possible. Sadly, I tried in vain to do so, could never get KVM-HV to be happy, and ended up kernel panicking the machine with KVM-PR. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/0b95d7bea3e9a270385a2360fbcf7f40">See if you can triumph where I have failed</a>. In the meantime, naturally you can do everything here on a T2 or Blackbird as well because that's how I did it writing this article, but there is no special acceleration for those systems right now.
</p><p>
The first order of business is the first order of business with any emulator: get the ROMs. Fortunately, no one is going to bust you for pirating a set of these because we're an open platform, remember?
</p><p>
The two pieces required are Skiboot and Petitboot, both of which live in the system's PNOR flash. <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">Skiboot</a> contains OPAL, the OpenPOWER Abstraction Layer. It comes in after the BMC has turned on main power and started the Power CPUs' self-boot engines, which then IPL ("initial program load") Hostboot for the second-stage power-on sequence. When Hostboot completes, it chains into Skiboot, which initializes the PCIe host bus controllers (PHBs) and provides all the basic hardware calls needed by a guest kernel to support the platform. You can think of it as something like an overgrown BIOS. This is the lowest firmware level of an OpenPOWER system that QEMU currently supports emulating.
</p><p>
Skiboot lives only to service a kernel, so it immediately starts one. This initial payload is the bootloader for <a href="https://github.com/open-power/petitboot">Petitboot</a>, which is also stored in firmware. Petitboot has a small Linux root (Skiroot) and acts as a boot menu, finding bootable volumes on attached devices or over the network. Having found one (or you select one), it chains into it to start the main OS, and from then on Skiboot will provide platform services via OPAL for this final guest until the system is shut down or restarted. Because it's in firmware, Petitboot is always available, which can come in really handy when you're trying to do system recovery.
</p><p>
The first, best and most dedicated way is to <a href="https://github.com/open-power/op-build">build Skiboot and Petitboot yourself</a>. They are open-source and the process is relatively well documented and automated, and you should know how to do this if you own an OpenPOWER machine anyhow. If you aren't doing this on a real OpenPOWER machine you'll need a cross-compiler, but most Linux distros offer such a package nowadays. Do keep in mind that if it looks like you're building a tiny Linux distro, well, that's because that's exactly what you're doing. The advantage here is you can fool around with the firmware at your leisure, but it requires a bit of an investment in disk space and time.
</p><p>
The second way assumes you have a more casual interest and would prefer to go with something prefab. It's possible if you (or, you know, your "friend") has a Raptor-family system to extract the necessary components right from the BMC prompt. Log into the BMC over SSH (or via <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2020/04/what-to-do-when-bmc-wont-talk-to-you.html">direct serial connection</a>) and type <tt>pflash -i</tt>. You'll see a list of all the partitions stored in the PNOR flash. The ones we want are <tt>PAYLOAD</tt> (which contains Skiboot) and <tt>BOOTKERNEL</tt> (which contains Skiroot and Petitboot). The exact addresses may vary from system to system and firmware to firmware.
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# pflash -P PAYLOAD -r /tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD" from 0x021a1000..0x022a1000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%<br>
root@bmc:~# pflash -P BOOTKERNEL -r /tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL" from 0x022a1000..0x03821000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%
</tt></p><p>
We skip the first 4K page to avoid the wrapping around each partition. <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> is actually compressed and needs to be uncompressed prior to use, so:
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# cd /tmp<br>
root@bmc:/tmp# xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Finally, <tt>scp</tt> both <tt>skiboot.lid</tt> and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> to your desired system from the BMC.
</p><p>
Admittedly we just talked at length about the two ways most of you <em>won't</em> get the firmware, so let's talk about the third method and the way most of you will, i.e., you'll just download it. Currently there is an irregularity about Raptor's present Skiboot build for this purpose: it only boots if you are emulating a single <em>POWER8</em>. That's not a typo. If you use it to boot an emulated POWER9, the guest will simply panic, and the guest will go into a bootloop if you are emulating multiple POWER8 CPUs (necessary if you need a larger number of PCIe devices). This is undoubtedly a QEMU deficiency which will be corrected in future releases. In the meantime, if you just care about playing around using a single POWER8 on a terminal, then Raptor's builds (either from BMC flash or downloaded) will suffice. However, if you intend to emulate a POWER9 or SMP POWER8 system, <a href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/pc-bios/skiboot.lid">download QEMU's own pre-built <tt>skiboot.lid</tt></a> and use that instead.
</p><p>
For Petitboot, we will extract that directly from Raptor's PNOR images. Assuming you didn't get it using the process above, <a href="https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Talos_II/Firmware">download the current Talos II PNOR image</a> and decompress it. In the <tt>shell_upgrade</tt> directory you will see the <tt>bzip2</tt>-compressed PNOR image. Uncompress that, leaving you with a filename like <tt>talos-ii-v2.00.pnor</tt>. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/4a2c907d0acec5b537cd4992a00801c3">Download my <tt>pnorex</tt> extractor tool</a> (it's in Perl, because I'm one of <em>those</em> people) and run it on the PNOR image:
</p><p>
<tt>% pnorex talos-ii-v2.00.pnor<br>
Version 1 PNOR archive with 33 entries.<br>
Extracting PAYLOAD at offset 8601.<br>
This is a xz format image.<br>
Wrote 1020K successfully.<br>
Extracting BOOTKERNEL at offset 8857.<br>
This is an ELF executable image.<br>
Wrote 22012K successfully.<br>
Extracted 2 partitions successfully.
</tt>
</p><p>
If you will be using Raptor's Skiroot, then uncompress <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> to <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> as above: <tt>xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Now, with <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> (for this first example, either Raptor's or QEMU's) and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> in the same folder, grab an ISO you want to boot. I used the prefab one Daniel offers on the <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power site</a> since I know it boots fine on OpenPOWER hardware. For our first example let's do a simple example of booting Void from a CD image on a POWER8 using the serial port. Our QEMU command line:
</p><p>
<tt>
qemu-system-ppc64 -M powernv8 -m 4G -cpu power8 \<br>
        -nographic \<br>
        -bios ./skiboot.lid \<br>
        -kernel ./pnor.BOOTKERNEL \<br>
        -device ich9-ahci,id=ahci0 \<br>
        -drive id=cd0,media=cdrom,file=void-live-ppc64le-musl-20200411.iso,if=none \<br>
        -device ide-cd,bus=ahci0.0,drive=cd0
</tt>

This configures a single-processor POWER8 system with 4GB of RAM, no graphics, and an Intel AHCI host controller with a single CD-ROM drive attached. The serial output should go to your terminal. It goes a little like this:

Here we are with Skiboot chaining into Petitboot. You can ignore the errors; there will be a lot of them since the platform is still incomplete. It will take a little bit of time to decompress the kernel (much slower than it would be on a regular system). You will notice a single device attached to the three available PCIe host bridges on the single POWER8 CPU, i.e., the host controller itself. Don't you just love that the vendor code for Intel is <tt>8086</tt>?

This is Petitboot. When the bootable choices appear, cursor up to the starred option and press E before it autoboots, because we need to tell Void its console is the on-board serial port (otherwise it uses a VGA console: not sure whose bug that is).

A successful login on your emulated baby POWER8. Ta-daa! To rudely pull the plug on the QEMU session, press Ctrl-A, and then X (<tt>QEMU: Terminated</tt>).
</p><p>
Let's now load out the POWER8. We would like to add a video card, an Ethernet card and a USB controller to our existing system, but POWER8 Turismo chips only offer enough PHBs for three PCI endpoints. How do we solve this problem? Easy: we'll add another processor!

CLXVI; western entrance of the Tachara of Darius (sketch by author), Persepolis; two reliefs on the Apadana, Persepolis (photo by author)</p></div>
<p>  If you look at modern paintings and miniatures, you would think we have a good idea of the type of shield used by Achaemenid infantry in the time of Darius and Xerxes.  They cite <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.61&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126">Herodotus book 7 chapter 61</a> and show the large rectangular kind on the middle row of the picture above.  But as I argue in chapter 6.5.2 of my forthcoming book from Franz Steiner Verlag, things are more complicated.  These large rectangular shields appear on the doorposts of two buildings at Persepolis and on two or three vases from Athens (out of thousands of soldiers at Persepolis and Susa and thousands of Red Figure vases). The person who published the sketch on the middle left thought it showed a battle against the Phrygian allies of the Amazons.  And this type of shield does not agree with Herodotus’ words that quivers were hanging beneath the shields, unless we understand ‘beneath’ quite loosely.<br>
<span id="more-7332"></span></p>
<p>  The type in the top row is also popular with artists, but it seems specific to the Aegean/Sea of Marmara/Black Sea region.  Warriors of all the different nations in this region used small round, rectangular, or crescent-shaped shields, often made of wicker or covered with goatskin, but we do not see these shields in artwork from the heart of the empire.  Its also hard to imagine these forming a barrier which needed to be knocked over after a long struggle, like Herodotus describes.  But they are the type of shield which artists from Athens most often put in the hands of foreigners, probably because the Athenians were a bit provincial and Thracians and Scythians were the most exotic warriors they were familiar with.</p>
<p>  The type in the bottom row is the most common type at Persepolis, but it does not show up in Greek art at all.  This might be because it was too similar to the Boeotian or dipylon or figure-eight shield and Greek artists felt that it did not say ‘barbarian.’  A bronze boss for such a shield was found at Samos.  It is easy to imagine quivers hanging beneath such a shield, but hard to imagine them forming a solid barrier which needed to be pushed over.  </p>
<p>  We see even more types of shield in art from the empire, such as the small round center-grip shield on the Çan sarcophagus or the big deep round wicker shields carried by ?Thracians? at Persepolis.  But these three types in the three rows are the ones people today are most interested in.</p>
<p>  Diodorus describes the Persian shields at Thermopylae a bit differently than Herodotus describes them at Plataia (11.7.3, my translation) “For the barbarians used small <em>aspides</em> and <em>peltai</em> which were advantageous in broad open spaces, being easy to move, so because of the narrow space they were not able to harm their enemies very well because they were packed close together with their whole bodies covered with the great <em>aspides</em>, while being at a disadvantage because of the lightness of their defensive arms, they suffered wound after wound.”  He seems to imagine Persian warriors using <em>peltai</em> like the barbarians in paintings (Xen. Cyr. 1.2.13)</p>
<p>  People in my lifetime have written a lot of nonsense about wicker shields supposedly being ‘light’ or ‘weak.’  I don’t know of any tests of this, and traditional wooden shields tend to be thinner and lighter than people expect (like 8 mm thick wood plus a layer of linen or parchment in the centre, and 3-5 mm thick wood plus a layer of linen or parchment at the edge).  Modern wooden shields often use heavy plywood and rawhide so the shield can stand up to pounding with blunt weapons: the fact that these shields are unnecessarily heavy is not important because the owners don’t have to march 20 miles with them on their backs, camp, cook dinner, and march 20 miles again.  Tough warriors like the Ottoman Turks used wicker shields and I don’t know of any of their opponents who said that these were poor protection.  Also, until about the time of Xerxes’ punitive expedition against the Ionians-beyond-the-sea, Greek art often shows spearmen with a light figure-eight shields (Dipylon shields, Boeotian shields) which may well have been made of leather or wicker.  Neither art not archaeology shows that all Greek “bearers of spear and shield” in 480 BCE carried a heavy Argive shield and a single long thrusting lance.</p>
<p>  The type of shield in the middle row is the best fit for Herodotus’ descriptions of combat, but not the most common type in art, and it does not match his description of how Persian soldiers were armed.  And as we saw, <a href="https://bookandsword.com/2019/07/06/provisions-loin-girdling-and-battle-gear-in-the-long-sixth-century/">lists of equipment for soldiers in Babylonia</a> do not seem to mention shields at all.  So like a lot of things in ancient history, the idea that Xerxes’ men carried large rectangular wicker shields is our best guess based on pretty thin evidence, not something certain.</p>

<p>A bunch of people have been sending me links to a particularly sloppy article that (mis)uses linear regression to draw an incorrect conclusion from some data. So I guess I’ve got to got back to good-old linear regression, and talk about it a bit.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the basics. What is linear regression?</p>



<p>If you have a collection of data – typically data with one independent variable, and one dependent variable (that is, the first variable can vary any way it wants; changing it will change the second variable), then you’re probably interested in how the dependent variable relates to the independent. <em>If</em> you have reason to believe that they should have a linear relationship, then you’d like to know just what that linear relationship is.</p>



<p>If your data were perfect, then you’d just need to plot all of the data points on a graph, with the independent variable on the X axis, and the dependent on the Y, and then your graph would be a line, and you could get its slope and Y intercept, and thus completely capture the relationship.</p>



<p>But data is never perfect. There’s a lot of reasons for that, but no real set of collected data is ever perfect. No matter how perfect the real underlying linear relationship is, real measured data will always show some scatter. And that means that you can draw a lot of possible lines through the collected data. Which one of them represents the best fit?</p>



<p>Since that’s pretty abstract, I’m going to talk a bit about an example – the very example that was used to ignite my interest in math!</p>



<p>Back in 1974 or so, when I was a little kid in second grade, my father was working for RCA, as a physicist involved in manufacturing electronics for satellite systems. One of the important requirements for the products they were manufacturing was that they be <em>radiation hard</em> – meaning that they could be exposed to quite a bit of radiation before they would be damaged enough to stop working.</p>



<p>Their customers – NASA, JPL, and various groups from the U. S. Military, had very strong requirements. They had to show, for a manufacturing setup of a particular component, what the failure profile was.</p>



<p>The primary failure mode of these chips they were making was circuit trace failure. If a sufficiently energetic gamma ray hit one of the circuit traces, it was possible that the trace would burn out – breaking the circuit, and causing the chip to fail.</p>



<p>The test setup that that they used had a gamma ray emitter. So they’d make a manufacturing run to produce a batch of chips from the setup. Then they’d take those, and they’d expose them to increasing doses of radiation from the gamma emitter, and detect when they failed.</p>



<p>For trace failure, the probability of failure is linear in the size of the radiation dose that the chip is exposed to. So to satisfy the customer, they had to show them what the slope of the failure curve was. “Radiation hard” was defined as being able to sustain exposure to some dose of radiation with a specified probability of failure.</p>



<p>So, my dad had done a batch of tests, and he had a ton of little paper slips that described the test results, and he needed to computer the slop of that line – which would give the probability of failure as a multiple of the radiation dose.</p>



<p>I walked into the dining room, where he was set up doing this, and asked what he was doing. So he explained it to me. A lot like I just explained above – except that my dad was a much better teacher than me. I couldn’t explain this to a second or third grader the way that he did!</p>



<p>Anyway… The method that we use to compute the best line is called <em>least squares</em>. The intuition behind it is that you’re trying to find the line where the average distance of all of the datapoints from that line is the smallest. But a simple average doesn’t work well – because some of the data points are above the line, and some are below. Just because one point is, say, above a possible fit by 100, and another is below by 100 doesn’t mean that the two should cancel. So you take the distance between the data points and the line, and you square them – making them all positive. Then you find the line where that total is the smallest – and that’s the best fit.</p>



<p>So let’s look at a real-ish example.</p>



<p>For example, here’s a graph that I generated semi-randomly of data points. The distribution of the points isn’t really what you’d get from real observations, but it’s good enough for demonstration.<img src="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/graph.png" alt="scatter plot of randomly skewed data" srcset="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/graph.png 346w, http://www.goodmath.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/graph-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px"></p>



<p>The way that we do that is: first we compute the means of <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x" alt="x"> and <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="y" alt="y">, which we’ll call <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\overline{x}" alt="\overline{x}"> and <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7By%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\overline{y}" alt="\overline{y}">. Then using those, we compute the slope as:</p>



<p><img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%20m%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CSigma_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20%28x-%5Chat%7Bx%7D%29%28y-%5Chat%7By%7D%29%7D%7B%5CSigma_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%28x-%5Chat%7Bx%7D%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title=" m = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^n (x-\hat{x})(y-\hat{y})}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} (x-\hat{x})^2}" alt=" m = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^n (x-\hat{x})(y-\hat{y})}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} (x-\hat{x})^2}"></p>



<p>Then for the y intercept: <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=b%20%3D%20%5Chat%7By%7D%20-%20m%5Chat%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="b = \hat{y} - m\hat{x}" alt="b = \hat{y} - m\hat{x}">.</p>



<p>In the case of this data: I set up the script so that the slope would be about 2.2 +/- 0.5. The slope in the figure is 2.54, and the y-intercept is 18.4.</p>



<p>Now, we want to check how good the linear relationship is. There’s several different ways of doing that. The simplest is called the correlation coefficient, or <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="r" alt="r">.</p>



<p><img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%20r%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cleft%28%5CSigma%20%28x-%5Chat%7Bx%7D%29%5Cright%29%20%5Cleft%28%5CSigma%20%28y%20-%20%5Chat%7By%7D%29%5Cright%29%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%20%5Cleft%28%5CSigma%20%28x-%5Chat%7Bx%7D%29%5E2%5Cright%29%20%5Cleft%28%5CSigma%20%28y%20-%20%5Chat%7By%7D%29%5E2%5Cright%29%20%7D%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title=" r = \frac{\left(\Sigma (x-\hat{x})\right) \left(\Sigma (y - \hat{y})\right)}{\sqrt{ \left(\Sigma (x-\hat{x})^2\right) \left(\Sigma (y - \hat{y})^2\right) }}" alt=" r = \frac{\left(\Sigma (x-\hat{x})\right) \left(\Sigma (y - \hat{y})\right)}{\sqrt{ \left(\Sigma (x-\hat{x})^2\right) \left(\Sigma (y - \hat{y})^2\right) }}"></p>



<p>If you look at this, it’s really a check of how well the variation between the measured values and the expected values (according to the regression) match. On the top, you’ve got a set of products; on the bottom, you’ve got the square root of the same thing squared. The bottom is, essentially, just stripping the signs away. The end result is that if the correlation is perfect – that is, if the dependent variable increases linearly with the independent, then the correlation will be 1. If the dependency variable decreases linearly in opposition to the dependent, then the correlation will be -1. If there’s no relationship, then the correlation will be 0.</p>



<p>For this particular set of data, I generated it with a linear equation with a little bit of random noise. The correlation coefficient is slighly greater than 0.95, which is exctly what you’d expect.</p>



<p>Ok, so that’s the basics of linear regression. Let’s get back to the bozo-brained article that started this.</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EcCqXojUMAEBFnp.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>They featured this graph:</p>



<p>You can see the scatter-plot of the points, and you can see the line that was fit to the points by linear regression. How does that fit look to you? I don’t have access to the original dataset, so I can’t check it, but I’m guessing that the correlation there is somewhere around 0.1 or 0.2 – also known as “no correlation”.</p>



<p>You see, the author fell into one of the classic traps of linear regression. Look back at the top of this article, where I started explaining it. I said that <em>if</em> you had reason to believe in a linear relationship, then you could try to find it. That’s the huge catch to linear regression: no matter what data you put in, you’ll always get a “best match” line out. If the dependent and independent variables don’t have a linear relation – or don’t have any actual relation at all – then the “best match” fit that you get back as a result is garbage.</p>



<p>That’s what the graph above shows: you’ve got a collection of data points that to all appearances has no linear relationship – and probably no direct relationship at all. The author is interpreting the fact that linear regression gave him an answer with a positive slope as if that positive slope is meaningful. But it’s only meaningful <em>if</em> there’s actually a relationship present.</p>



<p>But when you look at the data, you don’t see a linear relationship. You see what looks like a pretty random scatterplot. Without knowing the correlation coefficient, we don’t know for sure, but that line doesn’t look to me like a particularly good fit. And since the author doesn’t give us any evidence beyond the existence of that line to believe in the relationship that they’re arguing for, we really have no reason to believe them. All they’ve done is demonstrate that they don’t understand the math that they’re using.</p>

	<p>
		Back in August of 2019 I had a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/cr6x9a/contest_singalong_week_until_aug_25/">Sing-Along Week contest on RetroBattlestations</a>&nbsp;with the challenge of playing a MIDI file synchronized to a speech synthesizer singing the lyrics. In my stash of cards I found an MQX-32M MIDI card (Roland MPU-401 clone) which I wanted to use for converting MIDI signals to interface to an Apple II+ with an Echo II speech synthesizer, but ended up using a laptop with a USB MIDI interface. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/fz6is8/contest_pizza_week_through_april_19th/">Pizza Week contest</a>&nbsp;made me more interested in finding a 486 in a pizza box case and so my search began for a suitable case.</p>
	
	<p>
		Searching eBay wasn't easy because there's not really a good search term that would find the kind of case I wanted. I didn't bother trying to make a saved search since this project wasn't a high priority. Instead every once in a while something would inspire to go hit eBay and try some other search terms. A couple of weeks ago I spotted this 486 and made a guess of the size based on the size of the 5.25" bay. It's fairly slim, it has a riser card to turn the cards sideways and the case <em>is</em> shorter than an ISA card, but I don't feel like it's slim enough to call it a pizza box. It's close though!</p>
	
	<p>
		The motherboard is a <a href="https://stason.org/TULARC/pc/motherboards/T/TMC-RESEARCH-CORPORATION-486-PAT48PG4-VER-1-2A.html">TMC PAT48PG4</a> and it came with 32MB of RAM (technically 36MB, it had four 30 pin SIMMs in it too) and 4 cards: VGA, SoundBlaster, modem, and multi-function IO. The seller had tested it and was sold as non-working, won't POST, although he said the cards all worked. I mostly wanted it for the case so I wasn't concerned. Of course when I got it I had to see if the motherboard was really dead. It didn't work for me either but then I discovered if I hit the reset button it would give me some error beeps. I tried another power supply and it came up after hitting reset! It still doesn't cold boot when powered on, not sure if there's a bad cap or if the very slight battery damage (battery was removed before I got it) is preventing the reset line from being pulled after power on. Nonetheless it was working enough that I needed to explore its capabilities more.</p>
	
	<p>
		My ultimate goal is to get a <em>very recent</em>&nbsp;Linux distro and Python 3 installed to a "large" hard drive, but being that this is a 486 installing a current Linux distro isn't trivial. The only Linux distros that still support installing from floppy media are quite dated. Normally I would bypass a floppy install entirely and just boot an older computer via PXE and then install over the network. I thought I could <a href="https://ipxe.org/appnote/buildtargets">put iPXE on a floppy</a> and stick in an ISA NIC but iPXE just hangs without any error messages right after it's loaded from floppy.&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p>
		The BIOS is ancient and struggles with handling the "large" hard drive I hooked up. The drive is 8.45GB and the BIOS can only see it as an 8.0GB drive. Enabling LBA in the BIOS causes the computer to hang during POST after it detects the drive. Win98 fdisk insists the drive is only 504MB. FreeDOS can't see the drive at all. I tried sticking in a NIC with XTIDE ROM on the socket and XTIDE also insists there's no drive connected.</p>
	
	<p>
		Since I wanted to see how Linux would detect the drive that meant I needed to find a way to boot Linux. After a bit of googling I discovered the <a href="http://tiny.wiki.kernel.org/">make tinyconfig option</a> which makes a very small (but useless) kernel, small enough to fit on a floppy. <a href="https://weeraman.com/building-a-tiny-linux-kernel-8c07579ae79d">I enabled a couple of other options</a>, found a small enough initramfs, and was able to get it to boot on the 486. And as expected Linux has no problem with seeing that the drive is connected and the drive's full capacity.</p>
	
	<p>
		Next step is to actually get Linux installed to the hard drive. I'd rather not roll my own distro but maybe I'll have to. Another possibility is to boot Linux from floppy and then download a kernel and initrd from a current distro and kexec over to it. But that feels to me like reinventing iPXE.</p>

<p>Only loosely related to what it should do.</p>


<p>Code says what it does. That's important for the computer, because code is the way that we ask the computer to do something. It's OK for humans, as long as we never have to modify or debug the code. As soon as we do, we have a problem. Fundamentally, debugging is an exercise in changing what a program does to match what it should do. It requires us to know what a program should do, which isn't captured in the code. Sometimes that's easy: What it does is crash, what it should do is <em>not crash</em>. Outside those trivial cases, discovering intent is harder.</p>

<p>Debugging when <em>should do</em> is subtle, such as when building distributed systems protocols, is especially difficult. In our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper, we say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our code reviews, simworld tests, and design meetings frequently referred back to the TLA+ models of our protocols to resolve ambiguities in Java code or written communication.</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the implementation (in Physalia's case the Java code) is both an imperfect implementation of the protocol, and an overly-specific implementation of the protocol. It's overly-specific because it needs to be fully specified. Computers demand that, and no less, while the protocol itself has some leeway and wiggle room. It's also overly-specific because it has to address things like low-level performance concerns that the specification can't be bothered with.</p>

<p><em>Are those values in an ArrayList because order is actually important, or because O(1) random seeks are important, or some other reason? Was it just the easiest thing to write? What happens when I change it?</em></p>

<p>Business logic code, while lacking the cachet of distributed protocols, have even more of these kinds of problems. Code both over-specifies the business logic, and specifies it inaccurately. I was prompted to write this by a tweet from @mcclure111 where she hits the nail on the head:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since most software doesn't have a formal spec, most software "is what it does", there's an incredible pressure to respect authorial intent when editing someone else's code. You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422600236765186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>This is a major problem with code: <em>You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</em> You may remember, or be able to guess, or be able to puzzle it out from first principles, or not care, but all of those things are slow and error-prone. What can we do about it?</p>

<p><strong>Design Documentation</strong></p>

<p>Documentation is uncool. Most software engineers seem to come out of school thinking that documentation is below them (<em>tech writer work</em>), or some weird thing their SE professor talked about that is as archaic as Fortran. Part of this is understandable. My own software engineering courses emphasized painstakingly documenting the implementation in UML. No other mention of documentation was made. Re-writing software in UML helps basically nobody. I finished my degree thinking that documentation was unnecessary busywork. Even the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> agreed with me<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p></blockquote>

<p>What I discovered later was that design documentation, encoding the intent and decisions made during developing a system, helps teams be successful in the short term, and people be successful in the long term. Freed from fitting everything in my head, emboldened by the confidence that I could rediscover forgotten facts later, I could move faster. The same applies to teams.</p>

<p>One thing I see successful teams doing is documenting not only the <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> behind their designs, but the <em>how they decided</em>. When it comes time to make changes to the system—either for debugging or in response to changing requirements—these documents are invaluable. It's hard to decide whether its safe to change something, when you don't know why it's like that in the first place. The record of how you decided is important because you are a flawed human, and understanding how you came to a decision is useful to know when that decision seems strange, or surprising.</p>

<p>This documentation process doesn't have to be heavyweight. You don't have to draw painstaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ER diagrams</a> unless you think they are helpful. You should probably ignore UML entirely. Instead, describe the system in prose as clearly and succinctly as you can. One place to start is by building an RFC template for your team, potentially inspired by one that you find on the web. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ab961ecbced617ccd2461e/t/5d792e5a4dac4074658ce64b/1568222810968/Squarespace+RFC+Template.pdf">SquareSpace</a>'s template seems reasonable. Some designs will fit well into that RFC format, other's won't. Prefer narrative writing where you can.</p>

<p>Then, keep the documents. Store them somewhere safe. Soak them in vinegar <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/home-remedies-cough-relief">and tie them around your chest</a>. You're going to want to make sure that the people who need to maintain the system can find them. As they are spelunking through history, help them feel more like a library visitor and less like Lara Croft.</p>

<p>I'm not advocating for Big Design Up Front. Many of the most important things we learn about a project we learn during the implementation. Some of the most important things we learn years after the implementation is complete. Design documentation isn't a static one-time ahead-of-time deliverable, but an ongoing process. Most importantly, design documentation is not a commitment to bad ideas. If it's wrong, fix it and move forward. Documentation is not a deal with the devil.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>Few topics invite a programmer flame war like comments. We're told that comments are silly, or childish, or make it hard to show how manly you are in writing that convoluted mess of code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read. After all, you're the James Joyce of code.</p>

<p>That silliness aside, back to @mcclure111's thread:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This means comments that *reveal* authorial intent are valuable, and comments that reveal *there was no authorial intent* are even more valuable. Without those hints, you're left editing superstitiously, preserving quirks even when you don't know why. <a href="https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i">https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i</a></p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422825831596039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Comments allow us to encode <em>authorial intent</em> into our code in a way that programming languages don't always. Types, traits, interfaces, and variable names do put intent into code, but not completely (I see you, type system maximalists). These same things allow us to communicate a lack of intent—consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/RandomAccess.html">RandomAccess</a> vs <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>—but are also incomplete. Well-commented code should make the intent of the author clear, especially in cases where that intent is either lost in the translation to code, or where implementation constraints hide the intent of the design. Code comments that link back to design documents are especially useful.</p>

<p>Some languages need comments more than others. Some, like SQL, I find to nearly always obscure the intent of the design behind implementation details.</p>

<p><strong>Formal Specification</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184705-who-builds-a-house-without-drawing-blueprints/fulltext">Who Builds a House Without Drawing Blueprints?</a> Leslie Lamport writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The need for specifications follows from two observations. The first is that it is a good idea to think about what we are going to do before doing it, and as the cartoonist Guindon wrote: "Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is."</p>

<p>The second observation is that to write a good program, we need to think above the code level.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've found that specification, from informal specification with narrative writing to formal specification with TLA+, makes writing programs faster and helps reduce mistakes. As much as I like that article, I think Lamport misses a key part of the value of formal specification: it's a great communication tool. In developing some of the trickiest systems I've built, I've found that heavily-commented formal specifications are fantastically useful documentation. Specification languages are all about <em>intent</em>, and some make it easy to clearly separate intent from implementation.</p>

<p>Again, from our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>We use TLA+ extensively at Amazon, and it proved exceptionally useful in the development of Physalia.  Our team used TLA+ in three ways: writing specifications of our protocols to check that we understand them deeply, model checking specifications against correctness and liveness properties using the TLC model checker, and writing extensively commented TLA+ code to serve as the documentation of our distributed protocols. While all three of these uses added value, TLA+’s role as a sort of automatically tested (via TLC),and extremely precise, format for protocol documentation was perhaps the most useful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Formal specifications make excellent documentation. Like design docs, they aren't immutable artifacts, but a reflection of what we have learned about the problem.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>Building long-lasting, maintainable, systems requires not only communicating with computers, but also communicating in space with other people, and in time with our future selves. Communicating, recording, and indexing the intent behind our designs is an important part of that picture. Make time for it, or regret it later.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Latest on the 3d-printed keyboard switch project: I've reached a switch design that I think is probably reliable enough,
and I've put 3 of them together to form a macro keypad just to see how it all goes together before I commit to a
full keyboard. I don't have a number for how many presses the switch lasts, other than to say that
the motor on the testing machine stopped working before the switch did (after about 250,000 presses).</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHkOPBxnLtM">watch my short demo video</a> if you want.</p>
<p>"80%" and "60%" keyboard layouts are quite popular, which are correspondingly reduced versions of a full keyboard layout.
I like to think of this keypad as a "3%" keyboard, it's fine as long as you only want to type "jes".</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2746"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2746"></a></p>
<p>It's controlled by an Arduino Pro Micro. It's hard to tell from the pic because of the hot glue, but the switches are wired up to pins 2, 3, and 4, from
the other side of the board.</p>
<p>For the software side of it, I used the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/">Arduino Keyboard library</a>,
using <a href="https://gist.github.com/jes/fe1aeb18457a06562516372684d1bd47">this quick and dirty Arduino code</a>.
Approximately all of the code is just related to the debounce logic.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2748"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2748"></a></p>
<p>The switches are printed in some generic no-name clear PETG.
The case and keycaps are printed in <a href="https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/711-prusament-pla-prusa-galaxy-black-1kg.html">Prusament Galaxy Black PLA</a>.
I'm a big fan of this filament. The glittery effect means the layer lines almost completely disappear. It's basically the same effect you get when printing with
carbon fibre-filled nylon, but with none of the difficulties of printing carbon fibre-filled nylon.</p>
<p>All of these parts, including the switches, were printed on my new <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-mini/">Prusa Mini</a> printer, which arrived last week and I'm very pleased
with so far.</p>
<h2>Switches</h2>
<p>The problem with the switch design <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/keyswitch-update.html">from last time</a> was that the copper tape was splitting apart, which prevents it from conducting along
its full length. I initially thought I had
solved this by applying a 2nd layer of copper tape, but that turned out not to be a workable solution. I did a bunch of tests of various combinations of 50% and 75% activation position, and 1 or 2 layers of copper
tape, and found no significant correlation between either of those 2 variables and how long the switch lasts. The switches lasted between 225 presses and 330,000 presses before
failure. 7 failed by the copper tape splitting, 2 failed by the PETG spiral spring breaking (both after more than 200,000 presses), and 1 didn't seem to have any broken parts, it just wasn't reliably working any more.</p>
<p>This is the CAD model of the latest design:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2749"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2749"></a></p>
<p>The "leaf spring" has that funny shape in its bend so that it can tilt easily, which ensures that it makes reliable contact with <i>both</i> contact wires, instead of
just the first one it happens to touch.</p>
<p>And here's a slow-motion video showing how it works (a slightly earlier iteration, but the same concept):</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/peXFqVMugO4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Also, just for fun, I did some <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/freecad-fea.html">FEA</a> on the spiral spring
design, and it behaved just like the real version:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2724"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2724"></a></p>
<p>The red areas show the areas of highest stress, and indeed the springs tend to break around
the middle of the spiral.</p>
<h2>Print your own</h2>
<p>I consider this a "release candidate" rather than a finished design, because there is still
some work to do on it (in particular, I want to make it a bit less tall). But you can have it if you want it.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>FDM 3D printer (although I'd also be interested to see results from resin printers!)</li>
<li>PETG filament. You can try other materials. PLA works but makes for a heavier feel and breaks more quickly.</li>
<li>1.0 mm diameter copper wire, 90 mm length per switch should be more than enough</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/interest/3dpswitch-rc1.tar.gz">Download the STL files</a> and arrange them on the build plate something like this (you'll probably have to rotate the spiral spring):</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2750"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2750"></a></p>
<p>I suggest printing more than 1 of the "leafspring" part as it is a small part quite likely to
have defects in the print. Make sure you're printing at
a fine enough quality level to include all the features. In particular, make sure (both) the spirals on
the spring are connected all the way around, and that the leaf spring is connected all the way
along. I use the "0.15mm QUALITY" setting in PrusaSlicer. You shouldn't need any support material.
You might need to enable "detect thin walls".</p>
<p>You might need to add up to -0.3mm of X/Y size compensation. I have found that when printing
this on the Prusa Mini, optimal clearance is achieved when the 3.0 mm plunger rides inside
a 3.0 mm hole. On previous printers I've owned, this wouldn't even fit together. I'm not sure
what's going on, but obviously I modeled it to print on my machine, so you might need to apply X/Y
compensation on yours.</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Print the parts. It takes about 40 minutes for me.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Clean up any stringing inside the case from the PETG. I use a lighter to burn off the worst of it,
and then a Stanley knife to trim off what remains.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Examine the spiral spring and ensure that it moves freely. You might need to cut any
stringing between the spirals with a knife, or re-print with different X/Y compensation, depending on whether it is a few small
tight spots or bad clearance all the way along.</p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> Slide the spiral spring into the shelf at the top of the case. The orientation is not
critical, I tend to slide it in with the smoothest sides against the case just to make life easy
for myself.</p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b> Push the plunger through the top hole in the case, through the hole in the spiral
spring, and through the middle hole in the case. Verify that it moves up and down freely and that
the spring reliably returns it to the top. If not, take it back out and trim the tight spots with
a knife.</p>
<p><b>Step 6:</b> Cut off about a 13mm length of the copper wire. Slide it into the hole in the
leaf spring. If you can't get it through, you might need to widen the hole with a pin or sharp tool of
some kind. Use whatever you have.</p>
<p><b>Step 7:</b> Press the plunger down slightly to expose the attachment end inside the lower
chamber of the switch. Using a small pair of pliers or tweezers, push the attachment part of the
leaf spring onto the end of the plunger. Make sure it is pushed home. Looking in the big hole
at the bottom of the case, you should see the leaf spring roughly centred. When you let go
of the plunger, the spiral spring should still be stretched out slightly. This is desired, without
this preload the switch would start moving at 0 force.</p>
<p><b>Step 8:</b> Cut off 2x roughly 35mm lengths of copper wire. Using a pair of pliers, put a bend about
5mm from
one end. Insert the non-bent end through 1 of the wire holes and out the other side. Bend the wire
down the other side, and then in whatever direction you want your contacts to point. Repeat for
the second wire.</p>
<p>You should now have something that looks a bit like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2752"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2752"></a></p>
<p>And that should be it! Manually press the switch a few times and visually verify that the middle
copper wire appears to be making good contact with the other 2 wires, and then you're ready to
assemble it into a circuit! If you want it mechanically attached to a PCB, you could leave a longer
length of wire coming out of the first side, and you'd then have 4 soldering points. Otherwise,
mount it inside a 14mm square hole. You'll probably need cut-outs in the corners to accommodate
the wires sticking out, like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2753"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2753"></a></p>
<p>If you make one (or more!) I'd be really interested to hear your opinion on what could be designed
better, and to see pictures of your results. Email me: <a href="mailto:james@incoherency.co.uk">james@incoherency.co.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>We're getting pretty close to being able to put together a finished keyboard. I still
have the following things to do:</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>It would be good to get an accurate value for the number of presses that the switches can take. I
think currently a lot of the variability comes from the height at which the switch is positioned
relative to the tester. If it's doing 0.1mm short of a full stroke, the switch is likely to last
significantly longer than if it is being hammered 0.1mm longer than a full stroke. This is hard to
configure as I have only very coarse control of the height.</p>
<p>I watched the Linus Tech Tips tours of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1gP4PfqCQ">the
Cherry MX factory</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fNiJKh6q-E">the Omron factory</a>. They're both interesting and worth watching. I took a screenshot of this testing machine in the
Omron video:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2712"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2712"></a></p>
<p>So there we have a single motor raising a platform up and down which is pressing 10 switches
at once. The platform glides on a pair of linear rails, and the exact vertical position of the press
is finely adjusted with a separate screw for each switch. The moving platform also has
a spring at each end, I am not completely sure why, I think just to take up some of its weight, to
reduce the load on the motor.</p>
<p>But this is a much better way to gang-test switches than what I have at the moment, which involves
wiring up a separate motor for each switch and gets messy quickly:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2755"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2755"></a></p>
<p>I'm past the point where more testing is critical (famous last words, I know), but it would be good
to do anyway, so I'd like to make a small-scale copy of the Omron testing machine.</p>
<h3>Switches</h3>
<p>The switch fits in a 14mm square hole (apart from the protruding wires), which is the same size
as a Cherry MX switch, but the total height from the bottom of the switch to the top of the keycap
is almost twice as large, about 45 mm vs 25 mm:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"></a></p>
<p>This directly translates to increased keyboard height, so it would be good to cut this down
as much as possible. I should be able to lose 2 mm from the wire support at the bottom of the switch,
and another 1 or 2 mm in the height of the leaf spring attachment, but there's no way it's going to be
as thin as the Cherry MX.</p>
<p>I'd like to find a way to add a tactile bump (ideally with a clicky noise) to the motion of
the plunger. I did try simply adding a bump to the side of the casing that would catch on the
leaf spring, but it didn't work very reliably.</p>
<h3>Keycaps</h3>
<p>Currently my keycaps are based on the one I designed in <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/cad-dojo/stories/keycap.html">my
CAD Dojo project</a>. This is suboptimal for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>adding text in FreeCAD is extremely time-consuming, and it can't be edited without deleting it …</li></ol></div></div>

July 6, 2020 | https://kristoff.it/blog/addio-redis/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kristoff.it/blog/addio-redis/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Thanks Antirez for the code, the Redis manifesto, and for the free karma especially.</p><div><p>Last week I resigned from my position as developer advocate at Redis Labs.</p>
<p>I’ve never talked much about Redis on this blog because I made a point of trying to write interesting posts about different topics, and also to avoid any form of conflict of interest: I didn’t want people to think this blog was being used as a marketing outlet by Redis Labs.</p>
<p>Now that I’m not with the company anymore, I’m looking forward to sharing some of my thoughts on open-source software and related topics, using the direct and energetic tone that I always employ here. </p>
<p>This was the first job I took that wasn’t strictly about programming. It taught me a lot about communication, how information flows between groups of people, and how companies try to shape that flow.</p>
<p>While Redis Labs as a company isn’t perfect — I wouldn’t have left otherwise, and it wouldn’t have hired me in the first place, as I’m not perfect either — I’m happy with my experience overall. The one regret I have is that my position was in part meant to help the community better understand Redis, and I’m leaving behind me basically the same level of confusion that was there when I joined 1.5 years ago.</p>
<p>Redis is less obvious to describe than other tools in the same space, but that alone is not enough to explain why no one seems to agree on what Redis is good at, or what even is Redis. To me, the current situation seems caused by an ongoing turf war between tech companies, starting from the direct competitors of Redis Labs, up to the Cloud giants, who see themselves as the ultimate gatekeepers of modern software architecture.</p>
<p>Each of these factions wants Redis to be a different thing, and so they spend their budget accordingly, starting from developer advocates like me, up to de-facto astroturfers that I’ll leave unnamed. While you and I, dear reader, are surely immune to marketing and scummy tactics, those techniques do work wonders on the public, and the strength of true statements is only used as a way of making marketing spend more efficient.</p>
<p>This is where I imagined I would spell out my take on Redis, but <a href="http://antirez.com/news/133" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">now that Antirez has left the project</a>, it doesn’t matter anymore. Whatever Redis is going to be in the future, it will be shaped by sales tactics, whatever the Clouds are going to do next, and other uninspired metrics.</p>
<p>Since this is my goodbye post to Redis, let me add an over-the-top Italian skit before jumping into the lessons learned.</p>
<h2 id="if-redis-were-pasta"><a href="#if-redis-were-pasta" aria-label="if redis were pasta permalink"></a>If Redis were pasta</h2>
<p>If Redis were pasta, it would be served in a restaurant called Salvatore’s. It would be a plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce and a single leaf of basil on top; basically the Italian symbol for a simple, versatile meal. </p>
<p>Big tech would be like McDonald’s and Burger King: convinced that the future of nutrition is fast-food and constantly screaming that Redis can’t be considered a real meal as it doesn’t contain any bacon: “Come eat our new burger, which now contains an extra 4th layer of meat, exquisitely designed to make it easier to digest the meal!”</p>
<p>On a table you would find Jepsen, essentially the equivalent of Yelp, ideally meant to keep restaurants honest, generally correct, but ultimately not that different from other tech companies, and thus well deserving of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDlR_ccnZww" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">boogers and cum</a>.</p>
<p>Antirez, largely preferring cooking over serving, would end up selling the restaurant to the waiters, who at that point would make their priority to turn the restaurant into an Olive Garden.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned"><a href="#lessons-learned" aria-label="lessons learned permalink"></a>Lessons learned</h2>
<p>So where’s the Redis community in this story? Well, those are just the silent, mostly anonymous regulars that come, eat, and then go on with their lives. </p>
<p>It’s the people that occasionally show up on HN and point out that they’re happy with what Redis does for them, and that they rarely think about it even, as the software tends to chug along nicely. As much as I sympathize with them, the ultimate lesson I learned is that a passive community will inevitably lead to the death of a project.</p>
<p>While the “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23690123" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">spontaneus software</a>” world is busy infighting, big tech is systematically strip-mining it of any value, even when 99% of the value gets lost in the process. Tech companies are willing to go to any length to capture that 1%, and over time have learned to use Free software arguments against Free software itself, to ensure nobody would stop them.</p>
<p>The future of what we call today open-source software needs to learn to be in equal parts principled and pragmatic. The principles of human spontaneity must be preserved, to ensure we don’t turn in yet another fast-food chain, but we must understand that sophisticated ethical arguments require an equally sophisticated infrastructure beneath them, as without the latter the former can’t materialize into reality.</p>
<p>We need to keep our communities as much as possible engaged and invested in the success of our projects. The flow of information must be kept open and at high pressure, to ensure that our values and goals are well-understood by the majority of the community. Failing to do that means becoming servants of large donors and opening the community to all kinds of manipulations.</p>
<p>We need to reinvent the way we approach spontaneous collaboration in software and we must understand that it’s not going to be a peaceful process. Maybe it’s my native-american blood talking, but I feel I’m ready to get up close and personal with the world I dealt with for the last 1.5 years, except this time I won’t be wearing formal attire.</p>
<p><strong>I’m joining the Zig Software Foundation as VP of Community and it’s going to be my honor and pleasure to try to make all of this a reality for at least one project.</strong> If you want to follow us on this journey, <a href="https://zig.show/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">join us Saturday 11th on Twitch for the live announcement and first fundraising</a>. It’s going to be fun and, if we hit the corresponding donation goal, I will reveal my (until now) secret recipe for a nice summer pasta. Not as simple as Salvatore’s, but pretty good nevertheless.</p>

          <h3>The Story of M60</h3>
        
        
          <p>A few months ago, we made a hand-wired keyboard and brought Python to it. This project received plenty of attention, but it is difficult for most people to make such a keyboard. We believe that a Python powered keyboard will make a big difference. We'd really like to take this work further, so we start to design a new keyboard hardware. It is called <em>M60</em>.</p>

    <p>Have you ever thought about how people learn? What happens inside your brain when you learn some new information or practice a novel skill? And is there a way to enhance the outcomes of learning?</p>
<p>This article is the first in the series on “How People Learn,” in which I invite you to embark on a journey toward a better understanding of the most sophisticated construct in the Universe—the human brain.</p>
<p>And I would like to start with and exercise. You will need a piece of paper and something to write with. When you have them ready, write down the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I can write fast and beautiful.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be pretty easy, if not effortless, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Now, I would like you to write the same sentence one more time, below the first one, but at this time, use the opposite hand (let’s call it the inexperienced hand). Therefore, if you initially wrote the sentence with your right hand, switch your pen to the left side and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Think about how was it now? Unless you are a person that learned to write with both hands, I bet your second sentence is not that beautiful, and you wrote it not that fast either. When I was lecturing at the university and doing this exercise with my students, it took them somewhere between 3 to 10 times longer to write down the second sentence than the first one.</p>
<p>If you did follow through and write the two sentences, I highly encourage you to write it with the inexperienced hand for the third (and last) time below the first two sentences. It should be slightly easier to write it now, but there will still be inadvertent trembling and awkward lines.</p>
<p>How do you explain this? You know how each letter should look, how it should be tilted, and how curved it should be—you possess the theory at 100%. Yet very few can draw a well-rounded letter ‘a’ or ‘o’ with their inexperienced hand. It is very likely that you are also holding your pen as though it weighs 5kg, and your hand is trembling in the process.</p>
<h2 id="a-primer-on-brain-structure">A Primer On Brain Structure</h2>
<p>The answer resides in the structure of the brain. As you might know, the brain consists of brain cells called “neurons.” Let’s represent a neuron as in the next image.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/one-neuron.png" alt="A Conceptual Representation Of A Neuron"></p>
<p>Neurons connect to other neurons, forming a complex net of interconnected brain cells. According to the latest plausible estimates,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> there are 86 billion neurons in a human brain. And each cell can connect to up to ten thousand other neurons. That is an astounding amount!</p>
<p>I will not attempt to draw such a complex, interconnected set of neurons as in a human brain. I will not try to represent even the 302 neurons with its ~7,500 connections of a roundworm.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Instead, I will rely on this <em>extremely</em> simplified version of a <strike>brain</strike> group of interconnected neurons to describe some essential events that take place inside one’s brain.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/many-interconnected-neurons.png" alt="A Conceptual Representation Of Many Interconnected Neurons"></p>
<p>All our memories, experiences, skills, thoughts, sensations, etc. are encoded and stored within those interconnected brain cells.</p>
<h2 id="neural-patterns">Neural Patterns</h2>
<p>Neurons communicate with each other through electric pulses and chemical neurotransmitters. Whenever we do something or think about something, specific neurons responsible for that action or thought get activated by sending impulses to each other. For instance, when you raise your right hand, a particular group of neurons gets activated simultaneously:</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-raise-hand.png" alt="A conceptual representation of the neural pattern responsible for raising your right hand"></p>
<p>When you write, another group of neurons fires together:</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-write.png" alt="A conceptual representation of the neural pattern responsible for writing"></p>
<p>These groups of neurons that fire together are called <em>neural patterns.</em> When activated, they are responsible for specific actions or thoughts. Keep in mind that the examples above are extremely simplified. Real patterns spread throughout large portions of the brain and can incorporate billions of neurons.</p>
<p>Note that these patterns can overlap, meaning that the same neuron or even huge chunks of neurons can be part of several patterns. Below you can see that <em>“writing”</em> and <em>“raising hand”</em> share some of their neurons.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-common-neurons.png" alt="A conceptual representation of the neurons that participate in both raising hand and speaking"></p>
<p>This explains the associative nature of memory and our experiences—as you are thinking about something specific (i.e., your favorite childhood cartoon), parts of the neural patterns that get activated are also parts of circuits related to other memories. That gives you the possibility to “hop” from one memory to the other. Just try to recall an instance of when you watched that cartoon and let your mind wander for some time. You’ll be pleasantly surprised with where it might lead you.</p>
<h2 id="it-is-not-only-about-the-number-of-connections">It Is Not Only About The Number Of Connections</h2>
<p>Besides the number of neurons, one essential thing that characterizes a pattern is the strength of its connections. A connection can be strong or can be weak, and it represents the relationship between two neurons.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-strong-connections.png" alt="A conceptual representation of a neural pattern with different connection strengths between neurons"></p>
<p>In the image above, the thicker lines represent more durable links. The stronger a bond is, the easier it is to communicate between neurons through it, and the harder and longer it takes to break it apart. We’ll see the implications of this in the next section below.</p>
<p>Therefore, activities that we know how to do and with which we have experience and thoughts that we think about often have strong links between neurons in their associated patterns. Conversely, skills we have just begun to practice, or thoughts we rarely think about have weak circuits.</p>
<p>To make an analogy, think of a link between two neurons as a pathway during winter.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://storage.needpix.com/rsynced_images/trace-3438236_1280.jpg" alt="Snow Trail"> <figcaption>
            <p>Source:
                    <a href="https://www.needpix.com/photo/download/1618289/trace-snow-background-mood-wintry-snow-tramp-footprints-snow-lane-deep-snow">Needpix.com</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Initially, when you have to go from point A to B, there is no path, so you have to walk through deep snow, leaving a narrow trail in the process. Have you ever walked in deep snow? That is exhausting, and so forming new circuits is. But the more you travel along that path, the more trodden it becomes, and the easier it is to walk it. Eventually, it will become a wide sidewalk that you can use to travel between point A and B effortlessly. But if you will abandon that path, the snow will gradually claim it back, until one day it will just disappear.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-of-forming-new-circuits">The Process Of Forming New Circuits</h2>
<p>Thus, all the information we know and skills we possess are encoded in our brains’ neural patterns. It is time to discuss the process of brain circuits administration. Research from the last 100 years has incredibly advanced the understanding of how the brain rewires itself. This process is called  <em>Neuroplasticity.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Neuroplasticity,</strong> also known as <strong>brain plasticity,</strong> is the ability of the brain to undergo biological changes ranging from the cellular level (i.e., individual neurons) all the way to large-scale changes involving cortical remapping.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the fundamental principles of how neuroplasticity functions is the idea that individual connections within the brain are continually being created, strengthened, or removed, largely dependent upon how they are used.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Thus, neurons that are in close proximity and fire at the same time tend to form new connections (or, if they are already connected, the link strengthens). But in case a relationship is not used, it weakens over time, and eventually, it disappears, leaving the two neurons disconnected.</p>
<p>This theory was first introduced by Donald Hebb in 1949, and it is often summarized as <em>“neurons that fire together, wire together."</em></p>
<h2 id="going-back-to-writing">Going Back To Writing</h2>
<p>Knowing all that about our brain circuits and how they function, let’s analyze the previous writing exercise and describe it using our freshly acquired information.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/neurons-write-strong-connections.png" alt="Strong neural circuit responsible for writing with the experienced hand"></p>
<p>When you first wrote the sentence with your “regular” hand, you have used your existing, robust neural pattern responsible for writing with that hand. That’s why it felt natural and seamless.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/2-hands-with-question-mark.png" alt="Inexistent neural circuit responsible for writing with the inexperienced hand"></p>
<p>But when you switched to the other hand, no pattern was found responsible for writing with that hand, so a new one started to emerge.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/2-hands-with-both-patterns.png" alt="Emerging neural circuit responsible for writing with the experienced hand"></p>
<p>Different neurons fired together while you were striving to write each letter, and new links started to form. In case you followed my advice and wrote the sentence for the third time, the writing process should have flown more easygoing. That’s because the new pattern is strengthening in the brain! The more you will practice writing with that hand, the easier it will become for you.</p>
<p>This simple exercise demonstrated a fundamental truth that we sometimes ignore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge != Skills</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a sound pattern responsible for the knowledge about each individual letter and another circuit that is responsible for writing those letters. If you would take one thing out of this article, please remember this: <strong>knowledge</strong> does not necessarily mean <strong>skills.</strong> You might know something (the alphabet), but this does not imply than you will be able to write those letters.</p>
<p>This principle applies to many areas of our lives. For instance, reading a book on self-improvement, sales, public speaking, or anything else, does not magically teach you the skills described in those books. Reading those books will strengthen your neuronal pattern related to knowing. It’s like learning the shape of letters, the theory. Only when you begin to write, when you apply the theory into practice, then you start developing the patterns responsible for the actual skills.</p>
<p>There is much more to possessing an ability than just knowing the theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing the shape of the letters is not enough to be able to write. You need to develop proper muscle movement to hold the pen and draw the lines that form the letters.</li>
<li>Knowing some five steps to efficient sales is not enough to be a salesman. You need to learn to listen to customers, understand what relevant questions to ask, process the information you receive, formulate correct benefits that solve their problems, etc.</li>
<li>Knowing how to write code does is not enough to be a programmer. You need to understand how to define the architecture of a project based on the requirements, how to organize and structure your code, how to test it, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not mean that the theory is not essential. Conversely, knowledge about a domain helps you gain experience faster since you can interpret how good or bad the outcome of your practice is. As described in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/the-path-toward-mastery-how-to-become-an-expert/">The Pyramid Of Mastery</a>, knowledge and skills are complementary. …</p></div></div>

<h2>Preface to this blog post</h2>



<p>Why review a book from the hand of a notorious terrorist who killed three and maimed dozens of people? That seems like the right question to answer before continuing this blog post. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski">Theodore J. Kaczynski</a> is an extremely intelligent yet wounded man. He’s been a victim of cold-war era social experiments and, throughout his life, has always been an outsider. He retreated from society and lived like a hermit in the woods in Montana. Nevertheless, he was an activist in search of attention for his ideology and manifesto.</p>



<p>Numerous human lives have been sacrificed on the altars of freedom, ideology, and a better world. Wherever you position yourself on the political spectrum, from left to right, your heroes have blood on their hands. Reagan, Lenin, Bush, Mao, Napoleon, Robespierre, Obama, Chavez, Macron, Selassie, and Guevara, in one way or another, are responsible for the death and suffering of many. Yet we read their memoirs, manifestoes, and biographies. We have their posters on the walls of our children’s rooms. In this light, <strong>the refusal to read and review <em>Industrial Society and its Future</em> would be an act of hypocrisy. </strong></p>



<p>Finally, the central claim that technology is inherently bad for society is of relevance to this blog. I completely distance myself from the man’s actions, but his manifesto definitely struck a chord. I currently cannot think of a better way to scrutinize my techno-optimism than to write about it.</p>



<h2>The Power Process</h2>



<p><em>Industrial Society and its Future</em> is an essay of 232 numbered paragraphs in which Kaczynski explains what’s wrong with society, how it should be, and how we can get there. The most interesting parts of the essay describe the core concept of the <em>Power Process</em>, its consequences, and how technology has an impact on it.</p>



<p><strong>Human drives</strong> can be classified in three broad categories:</p>



<ul><li>Drives that can be satisfied with minimal effort: a walk around the block.</li><li>Drives that can be satisfied at the cost of serious effort: chopping down a tree for burning wood.</li><li>Drives that cannot be satisfied, no matter the effort one puts in it: somersault from a high cliff and survive it</li></ul>



<p>Kaczynski claims that <strong>all humans need a power process</strong>: (1) we all need goals, (2) effort to attain them, and (3) the attainment of some of these goals. Finally, it requires a degree of (4) autonomy. Consequently, the power process is part of the second category of human drives.</p>



<p>If unattained goals result in death, they are important. If the non-attainment of one’s goals is compatible with survival (i.e. not important), it will lead to defeatism, low self-esteem, and depression (as I explain later on). In the Western world, one only needs minimum effort to survive. Satisfying biological needs has been reduced to triviality. One can live off welfare checks, or have a bullshit job to satisfy physical needs. The only thing required is a minimal degree of obedience. Humans have given up autonomy and effort to attain the needs to survive — the important goals.  That’s why humans artificially create the four components of the power process for themselves: they are involved in <strong>surrogate activities</strong>: long-distance running, blogging, collecting stamps, gardening and even pursuing an academic career. </p>



<h2>Technology messes with the power process</h2>



<p>Kaczynski distinguishes between <strong>two kinds of technology</strong>: The first one is <strong>small-scale technology</strong>, like a mill or a water wheel. The second kind is <strong>organization-dependent technology</strong> that requires large-scale social organization: A refrigerator depends on complicated and industrially created parts and requires electricity. The first kind can produce real progress and freedom. The second kind has a negative impact on our freedom: the externalities outweigh the benefits. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">the prisoner’s dilemma</a> on a global scale.</p>



<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, most new technologies are of the second kind. The wave of <em>smart</em> and <em>connected</em> devices and software that’s heading our way is no different. Algorithms can curate all available information on our timelines, only inviting more and more (fake?) articles to be produced. Autonomous cars are safer and offer the freedom to keep the hands of the wheel. Yet as self-driving cars are simply sensors on wheels, you will have zero privacy regarding your location. Self-service checkouts are supposed to be faster. Yet as supermarket customers more often use them, fewer registers with cashiers will be available, reducing human personal contact. Oh, and you need a loyalty card, which is digital-only, for which you need a smartphone.</p>



<p>Social and psychological problems arise when humans cannot go through the power process. <strong>In modern society, technology (especially of the second kind) tends to push drives into the first group</strong>: gathering food is now <a href="https://www.ubereats.com/">one tap away</a>.  Intimacy can be achieved by <a href="https://tinder.com/">swiping</a> or paying a <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/live">minimum fee</a>. Leisure can be found on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/be-en/">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>. Turn up the heat by asking your <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_thermostats">Nest</a>. </p>



<p>On the other hand,<strong> technology also moved other drives into the third category</strong>. With urbanization reaching record numbers; experiencing authenticity, harmony, nature, silence, and clean air is nearly impossible for many inhabitants of this planet.</p>



<p><strong>Some important goals that remain in the second category, like achieving status, can no longer be done autonomously</strong>. To reach the highest echelons of the corporate ladder, one needs to adhere to company culture, engage in networking, and pass opaque assessments. A management position is often at the goodwill of another manager, higher up.</p>



<p>The primitive man only had to fear disease and certain aspects of the environment. He could accept this stoically, or invent gods and demons. But these problems weren’t man-made, imposed on them by someone’s decision which he had no impact on. Although many of us create them for themselves, for others,<strong> surrogate activities do not suffice. The results are aggression, mental breakdowns, burnouts, depressions, mid-life crises, and declining fertility.</strong> As decisions are increasingly outsourced to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing"><em>trustworthy </em>and <em>unbiased</em> machines</a> — think<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/technology/facial-recognition-police.html"> facial recognition by police departments</a>, or <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/01/21/137783/algorithms-criminal-justice-ai/">algorithms sending people to jail</a> — hopelessness and rebellion will only increase.</p>



<p>In modern society, mental health is defined by how one behaves in accord with the needs of the system.</p>



<h2>Technology is a rational response to problems</h2>



<p>A compromise between freedom and technology is impossible because technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom. That’s because each new technology appears to be desirable<strong> and only threatens our freedom later on</strong>. Motorized transport allows us to travel a lot farther. Yet once the adoption of cars reaches a critical threshold, one is <em>expected</em> to own a car: Local shops and public services disappear and become centralized in malls and government buildings. The internet allowed us to communicate with each other faster than ever. As companies adopted the internet, one can no longer apply for a job without an internet connection. Technology changes society as to make itself indispensable.</p>



<p>The following words read like a prophecy: “<em>Generally speaking, <strong>technological control over human behavior will probably not be introduced with a totalitarian intention</strong> or even through a conscious desire to restrict human freedom. Each new step in the assertion of control over the humankind will be taken as a rational response to a problem that faces society…”</em></p>



<p>For example, society has given up privacy to battle COVID-19 with apps and track&amp;trace strategies. Facebook promised us freedom of speech and unlimited reach, but without the financial means, you’re <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-algorithm/">shouting in a vacuum</a>. The Patriot Act (and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act">mass surveillance technology</a> that came with it) was designed to battle terrorism but introduced legal arbitrariness. These three examples were all <strong>rational responses to existing problems but produced unforeseen externalities</strong>.</p>



<p>As technology makes itself indispensable, machines will take care of more and more tasks and “<em>on those who are employed, ever-increasing demands will be placed: the will need more training, more and more ability, and will have to be ever more reliable, conforming and docile, because they will be more and more like cells of a giant organism.</em>“</p>



<p>Think of the swarm of Uber or Lyft drivers who took a short training on how to use the app and are now driving people around in servile silence. Their data feeds the algorithm, and the algorithm thinks for them. <strong>The only thing left is to abide by the system.</strong></p>



<h2>Revolution</h2>



<p>Which brings us to Kaczynski’s “solution”. This topic lacks the depth and cunning analogies that can be found in the earlier chapters. His recipes aren’t new: one can find elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin">Bakunist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony">Gramscist</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foco">Debrayist</a> thinking.</p>



<p>Because technology is the strongest social force, <strong>gradual change is impossible</strong>. The only way to break this circle, this slippery slope to servitude to the machine, is a revolution. While the system might collapse under its own internal difficulties, Kaczynski claims we should promote social stress and instability in industrial society. Humanity should return to nature to live in small groups and to be in control of life-and-death issues: food, clothing, shelter, and defense. This is true freedom: the power to control the circumstances of one’s own life. It’s not an ideology, it’s Nature with a big N:</p>



<p><em>“We have no illusions about the feasibility of creating a new, ideal form of society. Our goal is only to destroy the existing form of society.”</em></p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Manifestos are always dull, so I didn’t expect this book to be an enjoyable read. But quite a lot of insights were so masterfully crafted, that I often had to allow my mind to wander off in a quest to find (counter-)examples and arguments to what I just read. If you’re into political theory, this will be a treat.</p>

        <h2>Hacker News Design is Ugly</h2>
        <p>This thing is straight up ugly. It is too simple, useful, pragmatic, dense and practical. Boring. These days the cool things are purple gradients, lots of negative space and loss of contrast. People on HN keep <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23199603">raving</a> about this design thing but boy they are so wrong.</p><p>Let's fix it.</p><h2 id="current-state">Current State</h2><p>This is what HN front-page looks like when you login. It has absolutely zero pop. Typical engineers, what do they know about design?</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-05-at-11.35.01-PM.png" alt="" width="1938" height="2254" srcset="https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-05-at-11.35.01-PM.png 600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-05-at-11.35.01-PM.png 1000w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-05-at-11.35.01-PM.png 1600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-05-at-11.35.01-PM.png 1938w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Let's make it pop, shall we?</p><h2 id="fixing-hn-design">Fixing HN Design</h2><p>First things first. <em>Padding</em>. When I am bored, running out of ideas, I like to do one thing that usually makes things 10x better. Padding is like a chef's knife in the kitchen. Know how to use it well and you'll be cutting through information rich UI like butter. It is what sets professional designers from these gray-beard types.</p><p>It is difficult to do it right, so please allow me to exemplify the process.

Throw your creativity and objectivity away, the trend dictates what we should choose<em>.</em> May be it PANTONE will come up with a <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-intelligence/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2020">color of the year</a> and it will change.

It is not as complicated as it sounds. Simply put, we like to make things rounded as allows us to compete for a one of those web design <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards</a> and border-radius is a mandatory requirement before creating a <a href="https://dribbble.com/">dribbble</a> account.

It really ties the web page together.</p><p>Those pesky informative sub-titles are jarring as it helps the user too much. Let's make it so that it loses contrast and fades away in the background.

Everything is based on my personal experience working as a back-end developer at GoDee project. GoDee is a start-up project that offers booking seats on a bus online. You could find more information about this project here:</p><p id="e338">GoDee is a public transportation service. Bus transportation by GoDee is more convenient than motorbikes common for Southeast Asia and cheaper than a taxi. The app-based system allows users to find an appropriate route, select the time, book the seat, and pay for the ride online. And one of the problems of GoDee is traffic jams that severely impact the user experience. Users get tired of waiting and get annoyed by trying to guess the bus arrival time. So, to make the commuting more convenient, it needed service to calculate the bus’s approximate arrival time, aka ETA.</p><p id="5226">Developing ETA from scratch would take at least a year. So, to speed up the process, GoDee decided to implement the Google Distance Matrix API tool. Later they developed their own Pifia micro-service.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*vq9Ao08BtAdAMx5OYhbSlA.gif" width="250" height="429" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/34/1*vq9Ao08BtAdAMx5OYhbSlA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="b97d">Over time, the business grew, and the user base increased. We encountered a problem with increasing requests in the Google Distance Matrix API.</p><h2 id="8971">Why is this a problem?</h2><p id="2a4f">Because every request costs money, Google API provides 10.000 free queries per month, after which every 1.000 queries are charged $20. At that time, we had about 150,000 requests per month.</p><p id="7492">My mentor was very dissatisfied with that. And said that system should change caching to store ETA every 30 minutes. At that time, the system sent requests to the Google API every 3 seconds to get fresh data. However, such a caching algorithm wasn’t efficient, since minibuses were stuck in traffic. And so the distance only changed once every ten minutes. There was another nuance. For example, five users are asking for information about the same bus, and this is the same request. The cache solved this type of problem.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Сache Code</figcaption></figure><p id="8a43">The cache worked, but not for long since GoDee grew even further and faced the same problem — the number of queries has increased again.</p><p id="9a57">It was decided to replace the Google API with OSRM. Basically, OSRM is a service for building a route based on ETA (this is a rough but the short description, if you need details, here is the <a href="http://project-osrm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>).</p><blockquote><p id="113f">The Open Source Routing Machine or OSRM is a C++ implementation of a high-performance routing engine for the shortest paths in road networks.</p><p id="15be">Wikipedia.</p></blockquote><p id="97d4">OSRM has one problem: it builds routes and calculates ETA without taking traffic into account. To solve this problem, I started looking for services that can provide information about traffic in the specified part of the city. HERE Traffic was providing the data I needed. After a little study of the documentation, I wrote a small code that gets traffic information every 30 minutes. And to upload traffic information to OSRM, I wrote a small script with the command <code>./osrm-contract data.osrm --segment-speed-file updates.csv</code> (more details <a href="https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p><p id="cbda">Math time: every half of the hour, there is a request to HERE to get traffic information this are two requests per hour, that is, a day is 48 requests (24 * 2 = 48) and a month is about ≈ 1.488 (48*31 = 1.488) a year 17.520. Yes, we have these free requests from HERE for 15 years would be enough.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Code for getting traffic</figcaption></figure><p id="b1d9">Preliminary tests showed that the service works perfectly, but there is a problem, HERE gives traffic information in “gibberish” and the data does not match the OSRM format. In order for the information to fit, you need to use another service HERE for geocoding + OSRM (for getting points on the map). This is approximately 450.000 requests per month. Later, OSRM was abandoned because the number of requests exceeded the free limit. We didn’t give up and enabled the HERE Distance Matrix API and temporarily removed the Google Distance Matrix API. The logic HERE is simple: we send coordinates from point A to point B and get the bus arrival time.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2e81">After we installed everything on the test server and started checking, we received the first feedback from the testers. They said that ETA reads the time incorrectly. We started looking for the problem, looked at logs (we used Data dog for logs), logs, and tests showed that everything works perfectly. We decided to ask about the problem in a little more detail, and it turned out that if the car is in traffic for 15 minutes, ETA shows the same time. We decided that this is because of the cache because it stores the original time and does not update it for 30 minutes.</p><p id="1d5a">We started looking for the problem, at the beginning we checked the data on the web version of the HERE Distance Matrix API (which is called we go here), everything worked fine, we received the same ETA. This problem was also checked on the google map service. There was no problem. The services themselves show this ETA. We explained everything to testers and businesses, and they accepted everything.</p><p id="18ce">Our team lead suggested connecting another ETA service and returning the Google API as a backup option and writing code with the logic of switching services (the switch was needed if the requests pass the free number of requests).</p><p id="e9c2">The code works the following way:</p><pre><span id="b4e7">val = getCount() // getting the number of queries used</span><span id="9ff9"><em>if</em> getMax() &lt;= val { // checking for the limit of free requests for the service used</span><span id="e935">newService = switchService(s) // // if the limit is reached, switch the service return</span><span id="cae7"><em>return</em> newService(from, to) // giving the logic of the new service </span></pre><p id="054f">We found the following Mapbox service, connected it, installed it, and it worked. As a result, our ETA had:</p><blockquote><p id="625d">“Here” — 250,000 free requests per month<br>Google — 10,000 free requests per month<br>Mapbox — 100,000 free requests per month</p></blockquote><p id="4def">Always look for alternatives, sometimes it happens that the business doesn't want to pay the money for the service and refuses it. As a developer who has worked hard on the service, you should bring the task to real use. This article describes how we were trying to connect more services for the free use of ETA because the business did not want to pay for the service.</p><p id="4330">P.S. As a developer, I believe that if the tool is good and does its job well, then you can pay for the tool’s services (or find Open source projects :D).</p><figure><div></div></figure></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://www.jordanwhited.com/posts/corebgp-plugging-in-to-bgp/cover.png" alt="cover"></p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271" target="_blank">BGP</a> is one of many protocols that powers the Internet. Chances are you have heard of it, even if you don’t work in or around the computer networking space. If you aren’t familiar, I’ll try to provide some quick background:</p>
<ul>
<li>BGP is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol" target="_blank">distance-vector routing protocol</a> used to disseminate routing information.</li>
<li>A BGP speaker implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank">finite state machine</a> with 6 states:
<ul>
<li>Idle</li>
<li>Active</li>
<li>Connect</li>
<li>OpenSent</li>
<li>OpenConfirm</li>
<li>Established</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inputs to the BGP FSM include messages, timer events, and administrative events.</li>
<li>Routing information is exchanged via UPDATE messages in the Established state.</li>
<li>BGP is extensible; speakers communicate their capabilities via OPEN messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expanding on that last bullet point, it’s difficult to summarize exactly how/where BGP is used due to its flexibility and extensibility. Various <a href="https://ietf.org/about/" target="_blank">IETF</a> Working Groups continue to publish BGP-related RFCs for a protocol that took shape in the early 90s. As the BGP landscape and application widens, we need software that enables us to keep up.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll provide some of my personal experience and history working with BGP, and introduce a new BGP library, <a href="https://github.com/jwhited/corebgp" target="_blank">CoreBGP</a>, which can be used to build the next generation of BGP-enabled applications.</p>

<p>In October of 2010 I attended my first <a href="https://www.nanog.org/" target="_blank">NANOG</a> meeting in Atlanta, GA after accidentally falling into the position of Network Operations Engineer at work. I worked for a modest-sized hosting provider at the time, and was intrigued with BGP. Upon arriving in Atlanta, I vaguely remember some confusion after telling a cab driver that the hotel I needed to be dropped at was on Peachtree St. I later learned that there are 71 streets in Atlanta with a variant of “Peachtree” in their name, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peachtree_Street#Nomenclature" target="_blank">Wikpedia</a>.</p>
<p>I got where I needed to go, eventually, and the first talk I attended was <a href="https://archive.nanog.org/meetings/nanog50/presentations/Sunday/NANOG50.Talk33.NANOG50-BGP-Techniques.pdf" target="_blank">BGP techniques for Internet Service Providers</a> by <a href="http://www.bgp4all.com.au/" target="_blank">Philip Smith</a>. Philip started with the basics before getting into the techniques used at ISPs. So many light bulbs went off for me during this talk. I have yet to see any other BGP presentation cover such a breadth of information but still do it in a way that is beginner-friendly, useful as a refresher for any expert, and just downright interesting.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 10 years and I’ve gained a fair share of experience operating networks that use BGP. In more recent years I’ve shifted to software engineering where I’ve had the opportunity to implement various BGP-enabled applications for network observability, data analytics, and SDN purposes.</p>
<p>Each time I started a new BGP-enabled app, I had to answer the following question – which existing BGP implementation should be its foundation?</p>

<p>Of the handful of open source BGP implementations out there, I’ve had hands-on experience with projects making use of:</p>
<ul>

<p>BIRD shines where a <a href="https://bird.network.cz/?get_doc&amp;v=20&amp;f=bird-5.html" target="_blank">rich policy language</a> is needed. GoBGP has a <a href="https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/tree/master/api" target="_blank">feature-rich gRPC API</a>, and can be embedded as a library. OpenDaylight’s BGP implementation is part of a larger SDN controller solution and has extensive support for <a href="https://docs.opendaylight.org/en/stable-oxygen/user-guide/bgpcep-guide/bgp/bgp-user-guide-linkstate-family.html" target="_blank">BGP-LS</a>. Quagga can reliably produce <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6396" target="_blank">MRT</a> dumps and has been around a long time, though I believe <a href="https://frrouting.org/" target="_blank">FRRouting</a> is now considered its successor.</p>
<p>These are all mature, established implementations. Some of them are in production at large ISPs, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/scaling-droplet-public-networking/" target="_blank">Cloud Providers</a>, and <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/document/bird-manages-routing-worlds-largest-internet-exchanges-bird" target="_blank">Internet Exchange Points</a>. They are purpose-built and make various tradeoffs to suit their use cases (programming language, threading model, data structures, API, etc…).</p>
<p>But what if we are building something that doesn’t line up with the primary use cases of these widely used implementations? We may be locked in to decisions that are ultimately burdensome if we choose to build around them. Swapping in our own data structures for routing tables, or adding a new NLRI is non-trivial. Even if an implementation is intended to be embedded as library, it can still back us into a corner with resource consumption. There’s clearly a need to plug in or hook into specific parts of the BGP FSM, without inheriting decisions that went into a full-blown BGP daemon.</p>
<p>At the 27th IEEE International Conference On Network Protocols (ICNP), a group from the Université catholique de Louvain presented a paper on <code>The Case for Pluginized Routing Protocols</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract—Routing protocols such as BGP and OSPF are key components of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. These protocols and the operator’s requirements evolve over time, but it often takes many years for network operators to convince their different router vendors and the IETF to extend routing protocols. Some network operators, notably in enterprise and datacenters have adopted Software Defined Networking (SDN) with its centralised control to be more agile. We propose a new approach to implement routing protocols that enables network operators to innovate while still using distributed routing protocols and thus keeping all their benefits compared to centralised routing approaches. We extend a routing protocol with a virtual machine that is capable of executing plugins. These plugins extend the protocol or modify its underlying algorithms through a simple API to meet the specific requirements of operators. We modify the OSPF and BGP implementations provided by FRRouting and demonstrate the applicability of our approach with several use cases.</p>
<p>— <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Case for Pluginized Routing Protocols<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their paper they present a method for plugging into a previously mentioned open-source BGP implementation, FRRouting. Plugins exist at a function level, either prior to invocation (PRE), as a replacement (REPLACE), or just before returning (POST). Much of their BGP plugin focus is around the reception of messages, and decisions made shortly after:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The BGP daemon is also extended similarly. We add insertion points on functions receiving BGP messages from neighbours, on filters and inside the decision process. We also expose specific functions to the plugins that are executed by the uBPF VM.</p>
<p>— <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Case for Pluginized Routing Protocols<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They take a clever approach with plugin sandboxing by leveraging a user space eBPF VM (<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/ubpf" target="_blank">uBPF</a>) linked to the FRRouting protocol implementation. Each plugin compiles to eBPF bytecode and runs inside of said VM. Plugins can be loaded and unloaded without impacting the primary protocol implementation. Using an eBPF VM also allowed them to utilise all the pre-existing Linux Kernel tooling.</p>
<p>I found this approach inspiring, but still not quite a match for my use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugins appear to be built around “incoming” events, or messages. What if I want to inject an UPDATE message to a peer irrespective of what FRRouting wants to send?</li>
<li>FRRouting was not built with this plugin model in mind. Changes/Updates to FRRouting will result in a maintenance headache for the VM hook points.</li>
<li>eBPF bytecode is typically compiled from C. Writing C can be time-consuming in comparison to more modern languages.</li>
<li>I need to be an FRRouting expert to do anything non-trivial.</li>
</ul>
<p>This experience and research led me to create CoreBGP, a BGP library that I could re-use across my BGP-enabled applications.</p>

<p>CoreBGP is a BGP library written in Go that implements the BGP FSM with an event-driven, pluggable model. It exposes an API that empowers the user to:</p>
<ul>
<li>send and validate OPEN message capabilities</li>
<li>handle “important” state transitions</li>
<li>handle incoming UPDATE messages</li>
<li>send outgoing UPDATE messages</li>
</ul>
<p>CoreBGP does not decode UPDATE messages (besides header validation), manage a routing table, or send its own UPDATE messages. These responsibilities are all passed down to the user. Therefore, the intended user is someone who wants that responsibility.</p>
<p>The primary building block of CoreBGP is a Plugin, defined by the following interface:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// Plugin is a BGP peer plugin.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Plugin <span>interface</span> {
	<span>// GetCapabilities is fired when a peer's FSM is in the Connect state prior
</span><span></span>	<span>// to sending an Open message. The returned capabilities are included in the
</span><span></span>	<span>// Open message sent to the peer.
</span><span></span>	<span>GetCapabilities</span>(peer <span>*</span>PeerConfig) []<span>*</span>Capability

	<span>// OnOpenMessage is fired when an Open message is received from a peer
</span><span></span>	<span>// during the OpenSent state. Returning a non-nil Notification will cause it
</span><span></span>	<span>// to be sent to the peer and the FSM will transition to the Idle state.
</span><span></span>	<span>//
</span><span></span>	<span>// Per RFC5492 a BGP speaker should only send a Notification if a required
</span><span></span>	<span>// capability is missing; unknown or unsupported capabilities should be
</span><span></span>	<span>// ignored.
</span><span></span>	<span>OnOpenMessage</span>(peer <span>*</span>PeerConfig, capabilities []<span>*</span>Capability) <span>*</span>Notification

	<span>// OnEstablished is fired when a peer's FSM transitions to the Established
</span><span></span>	<span>// state. The returned UpdateMessageHandler will be fired when an Update
</span><span></span>	<span>// message is received from the peer.
</span><span></span>	<span>//
</span><span></span>	<span>// The provided writer can be used to send Update messages to the peer for
</span><span></span>	<span>// the lifetime of the FSM's current, established state. It should be
</span><span></span>	<span>// discarded once OnClose() fires.
</span><span></span>	<span>OnEstablished</span>(peer <span>*</span>PeerConfig, writer UpdateMessageWriter) UpdateMessageHandler

	<span>// OnClose is fired when a peer's FSM transitions out of the Established
</span><span></span>	<span>// state.
</span><span></span>	<span>OnClose</span>(peer <span>*</span>PeerConfig)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here’s an example Plugin that logs when a peer enters/leaves an established state and when an UPDATE message is received:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> plugin <span>struct</span>{}

<span>func</span> (p <span>*</span>plugin) <span>GetCapabilities</span>(c <span>*</span>corebgp.PeerConfig) []<span>*</span>corebgp.Capability {

	<span>return</span> caps
}

<span>func</span> (p <span>*</span>plugin) <span>OnOpenMessage</span>(peer <span>*</span>corebgp.PeerConfig, capabilities []<span>*</span>corebgp.Capability) <span>*</span>corebgp.Notification {
	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
}

<span>func</span> (p <span>*</span>plugin) <span>OnEstablished</span>(peer <span>*</span>corebgp.PeerConfig, writer corebgp.UpdateMessageWriter) corebgp.UpdateMessageHandler {

	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
}

In the US, Facebook makes over $25 per person on ads (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/" target="_blank">source</a>). Can you imagine if instead of ads they tried to charge people $25 a year?</p><p>Even on the margin, anything that costs Facebook users also makes it less valuable for its remaining users—it’s a negative feedback loop.

If a company wants to maintain a network effect, they need as many users as possible. If their marginal cost is low, then the easiest way to get users is to give the product away.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is the third part in a series about introducing the Rust language to JavaScript developers. Here are the past chapters:</p>
<ol>

<li><a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-for-javascript-developers-variables-and-data-types/">Variables and Data Types</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Functions"><a href="#Functions" title="Functions"></a>Functions</h2><p>Rust’s function syntax is pretty much similar to the one in JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> income <span>=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> tax <span>=</span> <span>calculate_tax</span><span>(</span>income<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> tax<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>calculate_tax</span><span>(</span>income<span>:</span> i32<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> i32 <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> income <span>*</span> <span>90</span> <span>/</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The only difference you might see above is the type annotations for arguments and return values.</p>
<p>The <code>return</code> keyword can be skipped and it’s very common to see code without an explicit return. If you’re returning implicitly, make sure to remove the semicolon from that line. The above function can be refactored as:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
  let income = 100;
  let tax = calculate_tax(income);
  println!("{}", tax);
}

fn calculate_tax(income: i32) -&gt; i32 {
<span>- return income * 90 / 100;</span>
<span>+ income * 90 / 100</span>
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="Arrow-Functions"><a href="#Arrow-Functions" title="Arrow Functions"></a>Arrow Functions</h2><p>Arrow functions are a popular feature in modern JavaScript - they allow us to write functional code in a concise way.</p>
<p>Rust has something similar and they are called “Closures”. The name might be a bit confusing and would require getting used to because in JavaScript, closures can be created using both normal and arrow functions.</p>
<p>Rust’s closure syntax is very similar to JavaScript’s arrow functions:</p>
<p><strong>Without arguments:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> greet <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> greet <span>=</span> <span>||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p><strong>With arguments:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> greet <span>=</span> <span>(</span>msg<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>msg<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>"good morning!"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p><strong>Returning values:</strong></p>
<pre><code>

<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>

<p>In Rust, we can’t directly use map/filter/etc over vectors, we need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert the vector into an iterator using <code>iter</code>, <code>into_iter</code> or <code>iter_mut</code> methods</li>
<li>Chain <code>adapters</code> such as map/filter/etc on the iterator</li>
<li>Finally convert the iterator back to a vector using <code>consumers</code> such as <code>collect</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>sum</code> etc</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the equivalent Rust code:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> numbers <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> double <span>=</span> <span><span>|</span>n<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>i32<span>|</span></span> <span>-&gt;</span> i32 <span>{</span> n <span>*</span> <span>2</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> less_than_10 <span>=</span> <span><span>|</span>n<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>i32<span>|</span></span> <span>-&gt;</span> bool <span>{</span> <span>*</span>n <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> result<span>:</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>i32<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> numbers<span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>double<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>less_than_10<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>collect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> result<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>You should be able to understand most of the code above but you might notice few things off here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The usage of <code>&amp;</code> and <code>*</code> in the closure</li>
<li>The <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> type annotation for the <code>result</code> variable</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> is the reference operator and the <code>*</code> is the dereference operator. The <code>iter</code> method instead of copying the elements in the vector, it passes them as references to the next adapter in the chain. This is why we use <code>&amp;i32</code> in the map’s closure (double). This closure returns <code>i32</code> but <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.filter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filter</a> calls its closure (less_than_10) with reference so that’s why we need to use <code>&amp;i32</code> again. To dereference the argument, we use the <code>*</code> operator. We’ll cover this in more detail in future chapters.</p>
<p>Regarding <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code>, so far we haven’t added type annotations to variables as Rust can infer the types automatically, but for <code>collect</code>, we need to be explicitly tell Rust that we expect a <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> output.</p>
<p>Aside from map and filter, there are ton of other <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful adapters</a> that we can use in iterators.</p>
