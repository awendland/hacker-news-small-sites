A little exciting.</p><p>I’d been wanting to talk to Matt for a while, in part because the pope actually turned down my recent interview request (someone please tell him how book tours work).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37ce1cde-dec5-4068-8ca8-3359f838647c_1308x264.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37ce1cde-dec5-4068-8ca8-3359f838647c_1308x264.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37ce1cde-dec5-4068-8ca8-3359f838647c_1308x264.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:264,&quot;width&quot;:1308,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:51146,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>And in part because I consider him (Matt) one of the more interesting, iconoclastic, morally committed, unpredictable, critics-may-care thinkers today. In the course of a typical Twitter day, which is a week in human time, I agree with Matt, disagree with him, wish I had thought of something he said, regret something he said on his behalf, retweet something he wrote, and make a mental note to talk with him soon. So I did.</p><p>And there we were, talking about everything — his political education, why he goes back and forth between thinking of himself as a progressive and not, his highly influential recent book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>” — when my phone began to crackle with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">news of an historic antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p><p>Naturally, I began to ask Matt about it. What he said was so compelling that I’ve decided to break our interview into two issues of the newsletter. Today: Matt Stoller on Facebook, this important case, and how monopoly is mistaken as a policy issue when in fact it represents an existential question of whether we are actually a democracy.</p><p>Then, before long, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107144/">part deux</a>, the political education of Matt Stoller — thinker, writer, civil servant, trustbuster, Twitter beefer, and, presently, aspiring political philosopher.</p><p>Without shame, I’ll add, in the spirit of Matt’s ideas, that if you want to do your part to support small, independent media, and haven’t yet, consider subscribing to The Ink.</p><h3>“The way we do business is the way we do justice”: a conversation with Matt Stoller, part one</h3><p>ANAND: Right as we're talking, I get a news alert: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">Facebook illegally crushed competition by buying up its rivals, according to lawsuits filed by 48 states and federal regulators</a>.” So this is the big case that we've been waiting for. Can you explain to a person who has never focused on this issue before in their life, and who just uses Facebook to try to get with their high-school ex, why is this a big deal? What does this mean?</p><p>MATT: So Facebook is a financial conglomerate. People think of Facebook as that website you use or the app that you use, but really Facebook, as a political institution, is a financial conglomerate and owns dozens of different companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, the social network. And it's a giant advertising company. So they have roughly three billion users. And they try to get their users to do things that their advertisers want them to do, because that's how you sell advertising.</p><p>The business model is to divert revenue that used to go to newspapers and publishers to themselves. And so by manipulating people in this specific way that they do, which is to keep them using their system and keep surveilling them so that they can target them with ads, they are, in the process, crushing newspapers and publishers, who no longer have any financing, particularly local newspapers and niche publications like Black-owned newspapers.</p><p>So increasingly those kinds of publications don't exist. You don't have reporters covering state houses and city halls and whatnot. Instead, people are now consuming things that Facebook likes them to consume because it keeps them using, and it keeps them available to sell ads to them, which are anti-social publications or posts, like anti-vax stuff or QAnon or whatever it is.</p><p>So that's the basic problem. It's a $70-, $80-, $100-billion-a-year revenue company that's destroying newspapers and publishers all over the world and getting people to pass conspiracy theories to each other so that Facebook can make money on advertising.</p><p>ANAND: You're an anti-monopoly guy. If there were three or five companies in healthy competition with each other, all doing exactly what you just described, wouldn't it still be problematic? Is the issue here that there's only one of them of that heft, or would a competitive market with five such players still be incredibly troubling?</p><p>MATT: There's a lot more that you have to do than just break them up. But the answer is, it would improve things dramatically if they were broken up, and you don't have to imagine it.</p><p>There used to be a bunch of social networks. Facebook's main competitor was Myspace, but there were a bunch of others. There was BlackPlanet; there was Friendster. And the way that Facebook actually defeated Myspace was by promising a safer, more private experience. They defeated Myspace by saying, We will treat your data carefully; in fact, when we change the terms of service, we will let our users vote on the terms of service.</p><p>This was back in 2007, 2008, 2009. And once they killed their competition, and then they bought up nascent competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp, then they didn't have to compete by offering a higher-quality service, a.k.a one that was less intrusive in terms of surveillance. They could just surveil anybody they wanted, and you didn't really have a choice.</p><p>ANAND: Where do you think this case is going?</p><p>MATT: They’re going to aim to break up the company. The House Antitrust Subcommittee did this long investigation of big tech, which includes Facebook. And one of the things they found is that Mark Zuckerberg was writing emails saying they were buying these companies to block competition. And so that's evidence that the mergers were illegal, because you're not supposed to buy companies to block competition. That's a violation of the Clayton Act. My guess is that they're going to have a pretty good complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>ANAND: Based on the history of such cases, would your assumption be that Facebook is broken up within a period of years?</p><p>MATT: Yes.</p><p>However, we haven't enforced the law for 20 years, so it’s not entirely clear. The law at this point is crazy and incoherent because we haven't done enforcement, and to the extent that we have, judges have just made wildly inconsistent rulings.</p><p>ANAND: This kind of action that's being announced today is the epitome of a systemic, public response to a problem. And when I, like you, advocate for those types of things, I often hear this response that I'm sure you do, too, which is, “OK, that's fine, but what about individual actions?” A lot of people are like, “Yes, let’s delete Facebook.” Or: “Why aren't you supporting the Facebook boycott?”, and there are different views on it.</p><p>There are some people who make the argument that those kind of small personal things are sideshows, distractions, maybe even unhelpful, because they reduce the perceived need for bigger systemic change. I fall more into that camp. There are others who say it's a gateway drug, it's a waystation, like: “Delete Facebook and then work yourself up to a political response." How do you weigh in on that?</p><p>MATT: I think it's a bad vision of politics. It's not doing politics to say, “Me, as a consumer, I can change power arrangements based on what I consume or don’t.” That's a real 1970s consumer-rights Democrat vision of the world, and that's one in which you as a citizen are irrelevant.</p><p>A boycott is only political if the goal is a policy change. If you go in and you say, "Well, I don't like Facebook, I want to change Facebook, so I'm going to delete Facebook," that's not going to do anything. If it's part of some larger political action saying, "Well, I'm going to delete Facebook, and then I'm going to push policymakers to break it up," I mean, I guess that makes sense.</p><p>But the general view of these boycotts is that just not using Facebook is the political action. But that's actually not a political action.</p><p>ANAND: An issue like monopoly is different from, say, healthcare, where you don't have to explain to most people the problem with our healthcare system. How do you think about making the issue of monopoly real to people and vivid and relevant to their lives?</p><p>MATT: I'm going to challenge the premise. I don't think monopoly is an <em>issue</em>. I think monopoly is a worldview.</p><p>My book is called “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>.” Anti-monopolism is a lens through which you understand power, and particularly commercial power. That’s the lens that I see the world through. And I don't just focus on Facebook or Google. I’m focused on anti-monopolism in general. How you use business institutions to coerce and bully — or liberate — other people in your society.</p><p>There's a monopolist who controls the cheerleading industry, which is very weird. I just learned there is a private-equity company that is trying to monopolize the software that churches run. There is a monopoly of Ultimate Fighting Championship-style contests. And then in healthcare there are endless numbers of monopolists. Ultimately, what a monopolist is is a person or institution that is controlling and governing a market. It's a private government versus a public government.</p><p>ANAND: You’re saying it’s incompatible with democracy.</p><p>MATT: Right. It’s a different system. When Mark Zuckerberg says he’s going to arrange electoral discourse in this particular way, or going to start a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-first-20-members-of-facebook-supreme-court-2020-5">Supreme Court</a>, or going to ban this or allow that, he is operating as the global privacy commissioner. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/4/9/17214752/zuckerberg-facebook-power-regulation-data-privacy-control-political-theory-data-breach-king">He even said</a>, "In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company." That's a direct quote.</p><p>As a society, the way we do business is the way we do justice.</p><p>ANAND: Understanding how these platforms work, do you think that if Mark Zuckerberg wanted to tip an election, he could? Would that even be illegal under our current system?</p><p>MATT: I don't know if it's possible, but it's certainly legal if he decided to.</p><p>I listened to this podcast with Zuckerberg where he said — this was right before he became unpopular, so he was still being relatively …</p></div></div>

This is a seismic step," said Dr. Sean O'Sullivan, a Tillsonburg, Ont., doctor and medical director of TheraPsil, a non-profit group that advocates for the therapeutic use of psilocybin.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is permission from the Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health to allow therapists to forward their own training in psychedelic medicine."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/337/291/Sickboy-640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Sickboy</span><span>1:02:33</span><span>Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine</span></p></div></div></div><span>Thomas Hartle never used drugs before his Stage IV cancer diagnosis.

Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin&nbsp;to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>They are good for one year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Psychedelic substances and treatment using these substances, such as&nbsp;psilocybin, is a growing area of scientific study and research. Because&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;is not an authorized therapeutic substance, the availability of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy is limited," Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The exemptions do not permit the health care professionals to prescribe or provide mushrooms containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;to another person. There are no drugs containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;that have been authorized&nbsp; by Health Canada. Health Canada's decision to grant these exemptions does not constitute an opinion or endorsement from Health Canada on&nbsp;psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, training, or the safety, effectiveness, or quality of&nbsp;psilocybin."</p>  <h2>Psychiatrists, nurses given exemptions</h2>  <p>"This is an immense step that the minister has taken, and a very wise step, a step that is totally congruent with the science and the published literature and is a very courageous move on her part and on our government's part," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Psychedelic therapies such as psilocybin and LSD have had negative reputations, in part because of the war on drugs, O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"The war on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster worldwide. It has criminalized behaviour that does not need to be criminalized. Cannabis has been legalized, and the sky has not fallen," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Those who have been given exemptions include psychiatrists associated with the University of Toronto, a community psychiatrist in Hamilton and his partner, as well as health professionals in Calgary and British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>  <p>O'Sullivan and his wife both got an exemption. He is a general practitioner and she is a therapist. He said it's important for doctors who could eventually prescribe psychedelics to be well versed in their effects.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Dr. Sean O'Sullivan is one of 16 health professionals who has been granted an exemption from Canada's drug laws to use magic mushrooms. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Sean O'Sullivan)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"You would not expect a guide to take any journey over any terrain with&nbsp;which the guide was not familiar. When it comes to psychedelics, the terrain is so unusual and so outlandish that it is absolutely imperative that the therapist have familiarity with the realms of the human unconscious that are visited under psychedelics because they can help guide the patient through situations that might seem utterly bizarre, even psychotic to an untrained therapist," O'Sullivan said.</p>  <p>"Great information can be obtained if you dissect and unpack that material that comes up under these medications."</p>  <p>Psilocybin&nbsp;allows the brain to put away the "default mode network," the part of our brain that worries about taxes and dinner and the shopping list, and dive deeper.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"If you look at your <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/seeking-seat-of-consciousness-in-dark-side-of-brain-1.1415607" target="_blank">default mode network</a>, you will find that the themes that come up are the same themes that came up last year and the year before and the decade before," O'Sullivan said. "Psychedelics disassemble the default mode network and they allow a person to have new experiences in a carefully controlled clinical setting. When the default mode network is put back together, it's not put back together in the same way as it was previously."</p>  <p>That's why a single dose of a psychedelic medicine can have more effect than years of talk therapy or medication, he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>As was his custom before the drive home from work with his son, the old man walked across the narrow, tenement‐lined street in Manhattan’s Little Italy to buy some fresh fruit. The grocer, who had known him for many years, helped the old man sort out some prize oranges and, as a gift, handed him a perfectly ripened, home‐grown fig. The old man smiled, accepted the backyard offering with a slight nod and started toward his car. It was then that he spotted two gunmen.</p>
<p>He called out to his son and began to sprint toward the safety of his car with surprising speed for a man of his age, but the gunmen were too quick. As they opened fire, the old man seemed caught in a great leap, suspended momentarily in the air, his arms thrown protectively around his head. Loud shots hammered through the street, bright oranges rolled across the gray pavement and the old man crashed onto the fender of his car and collapsed. The people of Mott Street watched in silence from tenement windows, fire escapes and rooftops as the gunmen slipped away. Then, to spontaneous applause, the grim street tableau came to life, and the old man—the godfather, <a href="http://www.thestacksreader.com/brando/">Marlon Brando</a>—lifted himself slowly from the ground, smiled at the cheering crowd and bowed.</p>
<p>At 11 o’clock on April 12, just as Brando was getting shot on Mott Street, Carlo Gambino, one of New York’s real godfathers, sat around the corner in a Grand Street cafe, sipping black coffee from a glass and holding 18th‐century Sicilian court in 20th‐century New York. He had arrived moments earlier in the company of his brother, Paul, and five bodyguards. It was his custom, as well as his duty as head of a Mafia family, to hear at regular intervals the endless woes of racketeers, dishonored fathers and deportable husbands. They were ushered before him, one at a time, from a waiting area in a restaurant across the street. He was the final judge to people still willing to accept his decisions as law.</p>
<hr>
<p>Back on Mott Street, two Mafiosi assigned to observe the movie production were unaware of his arrival. For hours, they had been watching Brando getting shot. They had had innumerable cups of coffee and had adjusted their open‐throat, hand ironed shirts so often that their collars had begun to wilt. Neither of them had been impressed when they heard Brando was to play the godfather, so they watched his performance critically. They volunteered to grips, cameramen and extras that they would have preferred Ernest Borgnine or Anthony Quinn.</p>
<p>“A man of that stature,” one of them said, pointing to Brando, “would never wear a hat like that. They never pinched them in the front like that. Italian block, that’s the way they wore them, Italian block.”</p>
<p>They did not like Brando’s wearing his belt below his trouser loops, either.</p>
<p>“He makes the old man look like an iceman. That’s not right. A man like that had style. He should have a diamond belt buckle. They all had diamond belt buckles. And a diamond ring and tie clasp. Those old bosses loved diamonds. They all wore them. Brando makes the guy look like an iceman.”</p>
<p>In truth, Brando did not look like the traditional double‐breasted, wide lapeled, blue‐serge racketeer. He had accepted the advice of an Italian American friend, rather than the Mafiosi themselves, and made himself look old and bent. He wore a sack shaped suit of an undistinguished brown stripe and an outsize over coat. He wore a cardboard‐stiff white shirt with a collar at least two sizes too large and a striped tie so indifferently knotted that its back, label and all, faced front. The makeup man, who was never very far away, had fixed Brando with an elaborate mouth plate that made his jaw heavy and extended his jowls. Brando’s complexion was sallow, his eyes were made to droop on the side and with his graying temples and mustache many people on Mott Street that day did not recognize him until the filming began.</p>
<h5>There was an aura about the production that was unmistakable, just as there is an aura of real and imagined power around the honored society itself.</h5>
<p>The two Mafiosi did approve the vintage cars and were amused by the streetlamps, pushcarts and prices, circa 1940, tacked up in store windows. But they did not like the way the godfather’s assassins fired their guns.</p>
<p>“They hold pieces like flowers,” one said.</p>
<p>Shortly before noon a third man came up behind the pair and whispered:</p>
<p>“The old man’s around the corner.” The two men were stunned. “You kidding?” one asked. “Believe me, he’s around the corner.”</p>
<p>“Kee‐rist!”</p>
<p>“Shooo!”</p>
<p>Without further hesitation—and with the same pitch of excitement most neighborhood people saved for a peek at Brando—the trio left the movie set. They walked quickly toward the intersection and stopped. One of them darted his head around the corner of the building for a quick peek and shot back to his friends: “He’s there. He’s there. I see his car. I see Paul’s guy.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Mario Puzo’s best seller may have started out to be just another multimillion‐dollar movie for Paramount, but it wasn’t long before its producers realized that to the Mafiosi themselves the making of <em>The Godfather</em> was like the filming of a home movie. Before Puzo’s book, cops‐and‐robbers novels and films about organized crime left the mobsters cold. <em>The Godfather</em> was different. When it was published in 1969 word quickly spread across the country’s most regularly tapped telephone wires about this different book on the “honored society.” It was their <em>Forsyte Saga</em>. It was filled with bits of underworld gossip and its characters could be compared to live dons, singers, movie moguls and hit men. It depicted not only their lives, but the lives of their children, wives, enemies and friends. It emphasized their peculiar code of honor rather than their seedy, greedy little maneuverings. It dealt with their strong sense of family and their passionate loyalties. It romanticized and exaggerated their political power, wealth and influence in legitimate business. But most important, it humanized rather than condemned them.</p>
<p>The godfather himself, for instance, was shot because he refused to deal in the dirty business of narcotics. Sonny Corleone, his impetuous heir, was killed in an ambush because he tried to save his pregnant sister from a brutal husband. Michael Carleone, the godfather’s college educated war‐hero son, assumed his father’s Mafia mantle not out of greed, but from a sense of responsibility to his father, who, for all his illegal activities, was a far more honorable man than all the crooked cops, venal judges, corrupt politicians and perverted businessmen who peppered the plot.</p>
<p>Though certain Italian‐American politicians and organizations condemned Puzo for defaming all Italians, the author heard no such criticism from the society about which he had written. In fact, shortly after his book’s publication, Puzo found that some Mafiosi were anxious to meet him. They wanted to compare notes with the author of <em>The Godfather.</em> They, like other fans, refused to believe that the book was all fiction. In Las Vegas he found that a gambling debt he had run up was somehow marked paid. When Puzo protested he was told, “It’s a certain party’s pleasure.” On other occasions, bottles of champagne would arrive at his table unordered. Multisyllabic names were whispered in his ear by reverential headwaiters, and men with sunglasses and diamond rings waved at him across darkened restaurants.</p>
<hr>
<p>Six weeks before the Mott Street shooting of Brando, Albert Ruddy, the film’s producer, was uncertain whether he would be able to make the movie at all. Paramount had been deluged with letters describing the project as anti‐Italian and threatening demonstrations, boycotts and wildcat strikes by everyone from maintenance men to electricians. Letters had come from Congressmen in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, as well as from dozens of New York State legislators, judges, civic leaders and businessmen.</p>
<p>One of them began: “A book like <em>The Godfather</em> leaves one with the sickening feeling that a great deal of effort and labor to eliminate a false image concerning Americans of Italian descent and also an ethnic connotation to organized crime has been wasted …. There are so many careers and biographies that could be made into constructive and intellient movies, such as the life of Enrico Fermi, the great scientist; Mother Cabrini; Colonel Ceslona, a hero of the Civil War; Garibaldi, the great Italian who unified Italy; William Paca, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; Guglielmo Marconi, and many, many others.”</p>
<p>The letter was signed by “the Grand Venerable of the Grand Council of the Grand Lodge of New York State’s Sons of Italy.” It also informed Paramount that the studio could expect an economic boycott of the film, petitions of protest from all Sons of Italy lodges, regional meetings to plan protests, a complaint filed with the State Human Rights Division and demands that no governmental authorities give the production any cooperation whatever.</p>
<p>And as if this were not enough, there were rumors of union walkouts, work stoppages and boycotts. Ruddy could envision costly delays. He had already run into trouble trying to negotiate with householders in Manhasset, L.I., for a site that looked like a godfather’s compound. The entire community and its bureaucrats had ganged up to sabotage his efforts.</p>
<p>“First, they’d complain that we would bring additional cars into the area and take up parking space,” Ruddy said. “So we’d promise to bus our people to the locations. Then they’d say they didn’t want buses in the area. Some said that if we did use their homes for the mall and the wedding the newspapers couldn’t know about it. How could we guarantee that? We were ready to pay, rent, replant, repaint, replace everything in the area for them. We were ready to make all kinds of concessions, but in the end I realized that they just didn’t want us. They never flat came out and said no, but it amounted to the same thing.</p>

                  <div>
        <p>“She’s away on vacation for two weeks,” said Bobby, manager of the village of Quaqtaq.</p>
<p>He was talking about the head of the recreation department, who had all of the keys, most importantly the one for the Isummasarvik School’s storage room. We needed it to get the sports equipment to keep the kids occupied at day camp: balls, badminton racquets, nets, and hockey sticks.</p>
<p>I sighed inwardly. Ever since I’d been working in Nunavik, finding a key had been a recurring nightmare. I had already given up hope.</p>
<p>“Maybe you could ask the caretaker,” Bobby suggested.</p>
<p>Anne, my colleague, nodded and waved me on. We got back into the truck. On the other side of the windows, the June sun was beating down on the frozen bay that it could not crack. We stopped in front of a house near the footbridge spanning the river. The caretaker was out, but her husband exchanged a few words with Anne in Inuttitut, then disappeared and returned with the miraculous key. I pinched myself. It had taken all of five minutes.</p>
<p>That was back in 2015, my fifth summer in Nunavik. If it had happened a few years earlier, I would have probably told the story on my blog, joking about how even a simple task can be so immensely complicated in the North.</p>
<p>But as the old man held out the keys, it hit me: it was my fault that it was complicated. I had begun setting up day camps in the North in 2011. Everything that I had found difficult then was difficult because I was trying to make things work my way: planning activities and appointments in advance, holding daily meetings, requiring long-term commitment from the camp’s employees. There was another problem too: I didn’t know the people or the language well enough. I didn’t know who the caretaker was or where she lived. I wouldn’t have been able to speak with her husband, who spoke only in Inuttitut.</p>

      </div>

                        </p>
          </div>
        </figure>
      </div>

      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p>I’d learned a few words, of course, especially words useful for working with children: <em>come here, sit down, do you understand, hurry up, are you ready, stop, wait, again, a little, a lot, yesterday, today, tomorrow, yes, no, maybe, what’s your name, and how old are you.</em> We’d played Twister once, so I also knew the names of body parts, colours, left and right. I knew the names of all the animals. It was a start, but not enough to converse with the caretaker’s husband.</p>
<p>Many of the <em>Qallunaat</em> (whites) I met among the Inuit described Inuttitut as “impossible to learn.” It did indeed seem complicated, with all those qs, ks, and js, but I loved its rough sonority. Moreover, I could never feel at ease with this linguistic one-sidedness. Some of my friends were taking online courses with Professor Marc-Antoine Mahieu at INALCO (Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales), affiliated with the Sorbonne in Paris. They all spoke about the class with the same blissful smile. In 2016 I signed up too. I had just quit my job to devote myself to writing. It meant that I would no longer be travelling to Nunavik but that I had more time—and I very much wanted to learn Inuttitut and keep a foot in the North.</p>
<p>In our first class, Marc-Antoine made a point of destroying our hopes. Inuttitut is a highly unfamiliar language, not nearly as easily learned as English or Spanish. Acquiring competence would take years of study and practice, and despite all that effort, we would very likely never be able to really converse.</p>
<p>Strangely, this bleak prospect soon seemed irrelevant. Little by little, I discovered a spectacular language, immensely creative and full of humour. A language that had to invent all sorts of slightly eccentric ways of naming the elements of modern life, but that described the land and hunting techniques with staggering precision. A language that seemed made for poetry with its constructed words and love of repetition; a language that taught me so many things about people that I’d been among for years without ever really knowing.</p>

      </div>
      

            
    
      

            
        

      
    
      

                  <div>
        






<p>Don’t believe everything you’ve heard, however: there are not hundreds of words for snow.</p>

      </div>
      

            
    
      

            
      <div>

      </div>

      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p>Over and over, I’d said what so many others have: that the Inuit have a very liberal concept of time. I learned that it could be as structured as my own; it was just structured around other things. For example, the months are defined by animal behaviours.</p>
<p>September, October, November: <em>amiraijaut, arnalirnguutivik, natjuijarvik.</em></p>
<p>Time when antlers lose their velvet. Time when the males compete for females. Time when caribou shed their antlers.</p>
<p>Places that I had known by their French or English names regained their original appellations: I now dared to utter the word <em>Kangiqsualujjuaq</em>; I no longer needed to say <em>George River</em>. I was unlearning my geography, just as so many Indigenous people have had to unlearn theirs. Even the idea of “the Arctic” once hadn’t existed for the Inuit. They had to invent a word for it that suited a Western geographical perspective: <em>Ukiurtatuq</em>, which translates as “repeated winter.”</p>
<p>I found that the language had a harmonious relationship with the environment—despite the occasionally ruthless climate. In the very first Inuttitut dictionary, written by Taamusi Qumaq in 1991, Nunavik is defined as “a large country occupied by animals.” I admired this humility, this awareness that a place is shared with other species, that one is living, in a way, on <em>their</em>&nbsp; land.</p>

      </div>
      

            
    
      

            
      <div>
        <figure>
                      <img src="https://content.beside.media/beside_/app/www/2020/10/AWH_2318.jpg" alt="">
                            </figure>
       </div>

              
    
      

                  <div>
        <p>It’s perhaps precisely because of this humility that one should never speak ill of <em>sila</em>, the weather. This was a blessing for a snow lover like me, tired of the eternal whinging about winter.</p>
<p>All of these words for different kinds of snow and ice, for Northern hunting and fishing techniques, show the extent to which the Inuit were at one with their land. Some people have bandied about the idea that the ancestors of the <em>Nunavimmiut</em>&nbsp; found themselves stuck in the North, blocked from going south by the Cree in the west and Innus in the east, but this is false. Research has concluded that the ancient peoples of the Arctic in fact moved even further north during a period of warming around the year 1000, because they did not know how to survive without the cold. Today, climate change has had particularly devastating consequences for the populations of Nunavik and Nunavut.</p>
<p>In the land that would become Canada, European explorers (<em>tariup akiani</em>, “from across the sea”) saw a vast reservoir of natural resources for exploitation. Our current climate crisis is the direct result of this unbridled exploitation, our stubborn insistence on doing things our way, our belief that we can draw a hermetic border between us and <em>nuna</em>, the great land, when in fact we live in each other.</p>
<p>Our language navigates modern urbanity with much more ease than Inuttitut, but it reflects a far more distant relationship with the environment, often stuck in the idea of fighting against the elements. Could the rich vocabulary of the Inuit inspire us to redefine our relationship with nature? <span>■</span></p>

I added this because, <a href="https://findka.com/blog/2020-12-05/">as I mentioned</a>,
I'm going to start doing more manual curation to make sure that Findka has a
steady stream of new, great essays. I also think it's a valuable feature for
anyone who wants a little more control over their Findka recommendations.</p><p>How's this different from existing RSS aggregators? For one thing, since this
is built into Findka, any articles that you like will start to be recommended
to other users, too. But there's more.</p><p>Most RSS aggregators keep your feeds separate. Findka instead merges them into
a single feed using a bandit algorithm. If you've subscribed to three
feeds—A, B and C—Findka will start out picking articles from the
feeds uniformly. 1/3 of the articles will come from feed A, etc. As time goes
on, Findka will adjust the distribution based on your usage data. If you never
click on articles from feed A and you always click on articles from feed B,
then Findka will show you fewer articles from A and more articles from B.</p><p>On top of that, the number of articles in your feed is controlled by you, not
by the feeds you subscribe to.</p><p><img src="https://findka.com/img/frequency-setting.png" alt="Example of subscribing to RSS feeds on Findka"></p><p>The result is that using RSS now takes extremely little effort. You get a
single, small feed that improves itself automatically.</p><p>I'm planning to add more RSS-related features—stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]>

We’ve created </em><a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank"><em>a starter repository</em></a><em> to show these concepts in PostgreSQL and MySQL </em><a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank"><em>on Github</em></a><em> if you’d like to dig in immediately while reviewing our process below.</em></p><p>Containers are a valuable resource for us developers. They give you the ability to package your production code, dependencies, and assets into a standardized unit. Once conveniently packaged, running your application in a variety of environments is a breeze. And yet despite containerization’s immense value, we often see teams overlook containers entirely when it comes to managing test databases. At Tonic, whether we’re helping our customers improve testing with high-quality test databases or building our own testing environments, we rely on Docker as a key part of the pipeline. Our customers are finding a lot of value in the approach, so we thought we’d share our strategy.</p><h2>The Trouble With Test Databases</h2><p>Let’s take a look at the typical growth of a test database for a team:</p><ol role="list"><li>You and your team realize that testing in production is a bad idea. You’ve heard about it or you’ve felt the pain yourself: mistakes that lead to data loss and time spent restoring from backups; poor reliability in production due to increased database load; the security team raising their eyebrows at giving too many people access to sensitive data; and the omnipresent anxiety that testing might take down production.</li><li>You decide you need data that’s similar to your production environment, so you write some scripts to generate some fake data (like<a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/how-to-generate-simple-test-data-with-faker" target="_blank"> faker</a>), use some free or paid services to generate some random data for you (like<a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/tonic-mockaroo" target="_blank"> Mockaroo</a>), or extract data from production and attempt to anonymize it later (dealing with the mess of maintaining referential integrity).</li><li>You shove either those scripts or data files into your code repo.</li><li>You write in a README the loader command to get it into your database of choice, and like a rite of passage, everyone on the team struggles through getting it to work during onboarding.</li></ol><p>And struggle you will! Databases are notorious for requiring large installations with a multitude of dependencies, navigating arcane configuration, and the extensive work of establishing the test dataset: creating schemas, creating tables, and finally loading your generated data.</p><p>Many teams will have a separate installation process for each operating system their developers use, each of which usually takes a good bit of trial and error after poring over database documentation. Others will set up a staging or test server for their team to use, but it risks becoming out-dated without a regular rebuild, it means a lot of coordination between team members, and there is rarely a one-size-fits-all test environment. For example, when you want to test the scale of your application, your entire team is saddled with a giant database that slows everyone down; likewise, too small of a database can limit effective testing for certain projects.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great if there were a tool that made it easy to package a database, its dependencies, loader scripts, and its data for any operating system? That any team member could use to easily test their code against a test environment, be it on their local machine or on a quickly spun-up test server in the cloud?</p><h2>Doing Better with Docker</h2><p>Good news, everyone! There is a better way! The many benefits that Docker provides for shipping your code in production work likewise for testing. You can create a database that is easy to distribute, deploy, and reset so that individuals and teams can work effectively without stepping on each other’s toes. For larger organizations, you can even package multiple test databases that each contain different tables or amounts of data, easily available to everyone in your engineering org. Best of all, you don’t need a different local installation README for each operating system—developers can just use the OS they feel most productive in without the headaches of the past.</p><h3>The Basics</h3><p>The simplest way to get started is to use a vanilla database image for your database of choice. By using docker-compose, you can set up the configuration once, and it’s just a<tt> docker-compose up -d </tt>to start the database. Here’s a basic configuration below:</p><h5>version: '3'<br>services:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testdb_postgres:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image: postgres:12<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restart: always<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ports:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 5432:5432<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSTGRES_USER: user<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSTGRES_DB: test_data<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;container_name: testdb_postgres<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volumes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- /tmp:/tmp<br></h5><p>This configuration does the following:</p><div><ul role="“list”">
<li>Creates a container named<tt> testdb_postgres </tt>that runs off of a PostgreSQL 12 image</li>
<li>Opens up Postgres’ default port of 5432 to 5432 on your host machine</li>
<li>Attaches the<tt> /tmp </tt>folder to your host machine’s<tt> /tmp </tt>folder</li>
<li>Creates a new user with credentials<tt> user/password</tt>, and a new database called<tt> testdb_postgres</tt>.</li></ul></div><p>Right off the bat, we’ve removed a lot of work from the README, and if you have data or data-generating scripts in your repo, you’ve made it much easier to get up and running quickly by simply pointing them to load into the database via the host part. Many databases have official images, including <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/" target="_blank">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server" target="_blank">MS SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/oraclelinux" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo" target="_blank">Mongo</a>, among others.</p><h3>Even Better: Packaging Your Data &amp; Scripts with Docker</h3><p>Instead of just using the available database image and calling it a day, you can easily create a new Docker image based off of your database’s official image. Many official images have an entry point folder that allows you to run scripts upon initialization, enabling the container to be immediately useful as soon as it’s up. To do this, you’ll likely need to add a Dockerfile and a build script, and potentially any data import scripts.</p><h4>Dockerfile</h4><p>Making a basic Dockerfile is not hard at all, in fact it’s only two lines:</p><h5>FROM postgres:12<br>COPY sql/*.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/</h5><p>Here we did the following:<br></p><div><ol role="list">
<li>We started by defining a<tt> Dockerfile </tt>with a<tt> FROM </tt>declaration pointing to the base image of your database.</li>
<li>We copied over all of our data import scripts (defined in a subdirectory named sql) to the<tt> /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ </tt>directory. Postgres <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/">defines this folder</a> for SQL scripts to be run during initialization.</li>
</ol></div><p>In our <a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank">code repository</a>, you’ll see we’ve commented out additional options to consider for your use case, such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>Adding any additional dependencies, like database extensions or certificates using typical package manager commands.</li><li>Adding data files to an accessible directory for use with data import scripts.</li><li>Adding custom scripts to import data outside of the container, e.g. via S3 or other data storage.</li></ul><h4>Build Script</h4><p>Here we simply create a shell script to make it easier to build the container. Our build.sh contains the following command which merely tags the new container as<tt> testdb_postgres </tt>and specifies the Dockerfile to use.</p><h5>docker build -f Dockerfile -t testdb_postgres .<br></h5><p>If you were building this in a CI environment, we’d recommend giving the tag a unique version for each build and release as a script argument, such as<tt> testdb_postgres:1.0.4</tt>.</p><h4>SQL Scripts</h4><p>Next, you’ll need to create SQL loader scripts that create your schema and load in your data. Typically the easiest way to do this is by using database dump commands with an existing test database. We recommend three scripts: the first one creates your schema without constraints, the second one loads your data, and the third one adds your constraints to all of your tables. This way, you’re able to load your data without worrying about the order in which it’s loaded (which would matter if foreign key constraints were already in place).</p><p>Some databases will turn off constraints using a data import tool until the import is complete, which means you can just keep your constraints in the schema script. For simplicity, in <a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank">our example code</a> we only use two scripts since our data script loads tables in order and doesn’t break referential integrity.</p><p>Sticking with PostgreSQL as our example, you can run the following command to get a dump of your existing schema and constraints:</p><h5>pg_dump -U user -s -f 1_schema.sql [YOUR DATABASE NAME];</h5><p>Followed by a similar command to get just the data:<br></p><h5>pg_dump -U user -a -f 2_data.sql test_data;<br></h5><p>Notably, we’ve added numbers to the beginning of each filename to ensure that the schema script is run before the data load script. (Postgres runs the scripts in this folder in alphabetical order.)</p><p>Take a look at our code to see the full output of both of these files. Feel free to modify these files as you like or write them from scratch, especially if you plan to load your data using a COPY or LOAD command.</p><h4>Modifying your docker-compose.yml</h4><p>Lastly, update the image you’re using to the name of your newly tagged one: image: testdb_postgres. If you’re versioning your container when you build it, we recommend specifying a stable release tag such as<tt> testdb_postgres:stable </tt>so that users can pull the latest update to that tag with<tt> docker-compose pull</tt>.</p><h4>Setting up CI</h4><p>Now you can check your Dockerfile, scripts, and data files into a code repo, and create a build for the Docker container in your CI service of choice using your build script. Any time the scripts or data files are changed, we recommend triggering a new release build for the container and pushing it to your container repository for use by your entire team (of course, after you’ve checked that nothing new caused the build to break 😉).</p><p>If everything is set up, it should be as simple as distributing the docker-compose.yml file to your team and running a<tt> docker-compose up</tt>.</p><h2>Next Level Test Data Management</h2><p>If you’ve followed the steps thus far, you’ll likely find that your testing setup is much more reliable and useful to your entire team, and it’s a big leap forward in efficiency.</p><p>From here, there are a lot of ways …</p></div></div>

<p>Most people thought I was crazy for doing this, but I spent the last few months of my gap year working as a short order cook at a family-owned fast-food restaurant. (More on this <a href="https://offlinemark.com/2020/11/12/gap-year-restaurant/">here</a>.) I’m a programmer by trade, so I enjoyed thinking about the restaurant’s systems from a programmer’s point of view. Here’s some thoughts about two such systems.</p>



<h2>Double, triple, and even quadruple fetching</h2>



<p>Human systems, at first glance, can appear broken, but due to subtle human factors, they might actually work just fine.</p>



<p>My best example is the system for taking and fulfilling orders. We never wrote anything down, and would re-ask orders multiples times, including when ringing customers up. (In computer security, this is known as a <a href="https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/kernel/double-fetch/">double fetch</a>.) Not great service and can theoretically let customers lie and pay less. </p>



<p>In practice most customers didn’t mind too much, liars are rare, and we can loosely detect when something seems off with an order.</p>



<p>Writing orders down and asking strictly once seems optimal but has subtle flaws. For one thing, there’s not enough space behind the counter for everyone to walk to the written order, so it requires more internal communication. This will fail during a rush when you’re blocked on order details and coworkers are too busy for questions. <strong>Customers are always idle; coworkers aren’t</strong>.</p>



<p>It can increase confusion if order slips aren’t thrown out when orders are finished and is also logistically (and literally) messy if you have greasy gloves and want to avoid touching a pen, then food. Lastly, many of my coworkers were older and very used to the existing system. <strong>A major transition to a new system would have generated more confusion than it’s worth</strong>.</p>



<h2>Scheduling algorithms for the fry cook</h2>



<p>While I covered a range of duties including the cash register, milkshake machine, and grill, I spent the most time on the deep fryer. I’m delighted to present this overanalysis of life as a fry cook, from a programmer’s point of view.</p>



<p>This is what deep fryers look like (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nachi.org%2Fdeep-fryer-inspection.htm&amp;psig=AOvVaw1D90dsceyn1wmU-KOGAEuy&amp;ust=1605391502547000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNCq-sPDgO0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">source</a>):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;ssl=1" alt="Deep Fryer" width="360" height="352" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>This picture has 2 fryers, each with 2 baskets that can be submerged to sit in the vats of hot oil below. At work, only 1 fryer would be active on any given day which effectively allows 2 items to be fried at the same time.</p>



<p><strong>Fry cooks have a lot in common with operating systems in that they are both responsible for scheduling</strong>. Operating systems schedule threads to run on a limited number of cores; fry cooks schedule food to be fried in a limited number of fryers. Different food items have different priorities, and different lengths of time to cook.</p>



<p>French fries, curly fries, and onion rings (collectively, “fries”) are the main menu items from the deep fryer. Each fry order could be large or small (except for rings which were only large) and eat-in or to-go. The job of the fry cook is to:</p>



<ul><li>Accept fry orders from the greeter.</li><li>Allocate portions of fries from the big bags of raw fries</li><li>Cook them in the fryers</li><li>Put them into the appropriate eat-in/to-go container</li><li>Serve them onto the customer’s tray on the counter, or their to-go bag</li></ul>



<p>The goal is to do this with maximum speed and accuracy and without dropping orders. You’ll ideally minimize the number of times you ask customers and coworkers for order details. In addition, there are a few sources of complexity to handle:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Incomplete information</strong>: Depending on the greeter, they may forget to specify if it’s eat-in or to-go. You can always ask the customer, but the grill chef will likely ask the same question in a little bit. You might be able to save a customer ask if you can eavesdrop on that interaction.</li><li><strong>Timing requirements</strong>: You need to finish orders by the time the grill chef finishes the burgers/hot dogs, but you shouldn’t finish too early. If you put the fries on the counter way before the burgers are ready, they’ll get cold. This matters less for to-go orders, which you can serve into the bag immediately.</li><li><strong>Scale</strong>: During a rush, you might receive many orders per minute, while only being able to process 1-2 per minute. Once the greeter relays the order, they forget it, so it’s up to you to remember. And remember: no writing things down.</li><li><span><strong>Waste avoidance</strong>: </span>Sometimes you or another cook will make too many fries. To avoid wasting them, you can use the excess towards a future order by refreshing them with a splash later and adding them to a fresh batch.</li><li><strong>Changing orders</strong>: Customers sometimes change their order after you’ve started cooking (e.g. regular fry to curly fry). Now you have to figure out what to do with the partially cooked portion currently in the fryer.</li><li><strong><strong>Misc items</strong></strong>: In addition to fries, there other items that need to be scheduled for time in the fryer, including chicken patties, bacon, clam strips, and fish fillets. </li></ul>



<p>A few techniques to manage all this:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Batching orders together</strong>. If a large and small fry order are in the queue, you can cook them in the same basket at the same time.<ul><li>Some customers request their fries “well done”, meaning cooked extra long. This makes batching more complicated.</li></ul></li><li><strong>“Wait n Splash”</strong>: If a fry order is done cooking far before the rest of the grill items and you don’t have pressing items that need fryer time, you can raise the basket from the oil, but leave the food in it. When the grill items finish, you can quickly splash the food back in the oil to refresh it, then serve it. This will prevent it from getting cold on the counter.</li><li><strong>Inactive fryer baskets</strong>: It can be handy to have extra storage space for cooked food. If you have a “wait n splash” order waiting, but you have more orders to fry, you can use the 2 spare baskets from the inactive fryer to store the waiting order and free up the fryer slot. This is also useful when customers change their order and you need to quickly stash the half cooked portion somewhere and start the adjusted order.</li><li><strong>“The tong dip”</strong>: If both fryers are in use and the grill chef hands you bacon to be urgently cooked, you can hold the bacon in tongs and dip it into one of the submerged baskets. This lets you effectively cook more than 2 things at the same time.</li></ul>



<p>Here’s the system I ended up using. When a new order came in, I’d stop whatever I was doing and grab the appropriate container and place it in the corresponding fry bucket. This captures all 3 pieces of information about the order (fry type, size, to-go?) letting me forget it. If I strictly follow this, I can just process the containers in the buckets like a queue. However, I still need to keep a sense of order memorized because the system doesn’t capture global ordering – if I have containers in the fry, curly fry, and onion ring buckets, I can’t tell which order came in first.</p>



<p>I don’t have a solution for this. On a super busy day, this system falls apart and I drop orders. Extreme load like that has only happened a few times and in that case, I just make large batches, forget about syncing up with the grill items, and hope I don’t have too much excess at the end. Generally, the system worked nicely.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It’s fun to think about human systems, like those in a restaurant, from a programmer’s point of view. A fry cook’s job closely resembles that of an operating system scheduler, complete with optimization points and edge cases. One can try to optimize human systems as if they were computer systems, but it’s critical to understand the subtle human aspects of the system when evaluating improvements.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>We are excited to announce that we signed a <a href="http://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/pixie-developer-first-observability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">definitive agreement</a> to join New Relic -- an outcome we certainly never predicted after only just two years.</p><p>New Relic’s focus on the developer is legendary. When New Relic's Founder/CEO, Lew Cirne, first started tinkering around with Pixie and participating in our community, we noticed an alignment in our visions for the future of observability, as well as echoes of New Relic’s developer-centric roots in Pixie. Joining New Relic will provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to reach millions of developers faster by open-sourcing a self-managed version of Pixie in the upcoming months.</p><p>When we started Pixie in 2018, Kubernetes was rapidly gaining traction. We felt that a new approach to observability was needed due to the new, fundamental challenges in observing distributed, ephemeral systems. We founded Pixie in order to provide instant, flexible observability for developers like ourselves who were building applications on Kubernetes.</p><p>However, we knew that the most developer-friendly version of Pixie must be open-source. In a forward-looking move, New Relic is giving us the opportunity to open-source Pixie and focus on providing world-class observability to all developers. The developer community is a core element of New Relic’s vision, and Pixie’s open-source offering will be a key part of that initiative and the primary area of focus for the Pixie team going forward.</p><p>We are so excited to begin working with New Relic on our shared vision for the future of observability. In the coming months, we’ll be jointly committing our roadmap in the following initiatives:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pixie Core</strong>: An open-source and self-managed version of Pixie which we will release to the CNCF sandbox early next year. As part of the process, we look forward to speaking with you about this at Kubecon-EU on May’21. Due to Pixie’s and New Relic’s commitment to open standards, we also plan to build out integrations with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pixie By New Relic</strong>: Our current Pixie Community offering will continue as a hosted version of Pixie Core and existing New Relic One customers will soon get instant access to Pixie data with a few clicks. Their existing experiences will be augmented with the metrics, logs, events, and application traces that Pixie automatically provides.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pixie by New Relic, Enterprise Edition</strong>: Industry-specific solutions for sectors such as Media, Telecommunications, and Government that allow enterprise customers to install Pixie entirely inside production clusters while meeting compliance, data security, support, and performance requirements.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, our journey is just beginning. We are a team of 12 people with a huge vision to reach every Kubernetes developer. As we embark on this part of our journey, we encourage anyone passionate about open source, Kubernetes, and observability to apply to join us <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>You can try out Pixie <a href="https://work.withpixie.ai/auth/signup?UTM=PXNR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, learn more about us <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and ping us anytime on our Pixienaut community slack.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main_content"><div><div><p>Last Updated </p><!-- --><p>May 30, 2020</p></div><div><p>Reading Times:</p><p>Summary only: 1 minute</p></div></div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Every YC batch, Michael Seibel gives a talk about building product. He'll ask: "<a href="https://youtu.be/C27RVio2rOs?t=1677">How many of you are using Google Analytics as your primary source of metrics?</a>" But it's a trick question. When the majority of the audience eventually raises their hands, he'll fake a sigh and tell everyone that they're doing it wrong, and that they should instead by relying on an event-based analytics tool.<span></span><span>The linked video is from Startup School, but the same talk is given at YC Core as well.</span></p><p>It's a perennial favorite, but don't let the humor distract you. Michael's got a
good point. Without using an event-based analytics tool, which tracks the interactions your users have with your product, you won't know <em>how</em> your
users are using your product. This is arguably just as important as actually
building out the product. There are a lot of event-based analytics tools out
there, but we think that if you're an early-stage startup, Heap makes the best tradeoffs.</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heap.io/"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b6fae69c970dbd3257184ea4d909f5d858810bdc/35c24/logos/heap.svg"></a></p><div><p>Our Recommendation</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heap.io/">Heap</a></p><p>Highest benefit-to-effort ratio</p><p>Gave us auto-tracking functionality, which we think is an exceptionally good safety net for an early-stage startup with rapidly-changing features and limited engineering resources, although it lacks some of the extensibility and more advanced analysis capabilities of its competitors. That said, we think this tradeoff best suits an early-stage startup.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heap.io/">heap.io</a></p></div></div><summary><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><ul><li>"Setting up event-based metrics is something that's super important very early in your company, because it's how you know whether your product is being used or not. And it's the number one source of new product ideas and inspiration." - Michael Seibel</li><li>Google Analytics by itself is insufficient to figure out how your users are using your product, although it is useful to complement an event-based analytics tool.</li><li>Event-based analytics help you figure out what actions a user took on your website.</li><li>We are primarily focused on evaluating the three main event-based analytics tools: Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Heap.</li><li>We found that event-based analytics is a category of SaaS with some of the most feature parity.</li><li>The core analytics functionality of all three tools is more or less equivalent.</li><li>The key considerations for an early-stage startup are the amount of maintenance and discipline required to maintain useful analytics, and the ability to go far without spending a lot of money.</li><li>We found that defining events in code while having auto-track as a safety net is a near-ideal setup for an early stage startup.</li><li>We recommend Heap, because it is the only major analytics tool that offers this capability. The main downside for an early-stage startup is that you can't get as far on a free plan on Heap compared to Mixpanel or Amplitude.</li><li>If pricing is the main consideration, then we recommend Amplitude. Even though its product is oriented towards later-stage companies, Amplitude has the most generous free plan of the major event-based analytics providers.</li></ul></summary><h2 id="ratings-matrix">Ratings Matrix</h2><h2 id="context">Context</h2><h3 id="what-is-event-based-analytics">What is event-based analytics?</h3><p>Pageview-based analytics tools like Google Analytics and event-based analytics tools such as Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Heap are typically grouped together under the heading of analytics tools. However, we think that lumping them all under the same heading is misleading, because they fundamentally do different things. To better understand what event-based analytics are, we need to understand what exactly Google Analytics does, figure out where its gaps are, and then use that context to motivate event-based analytics tools. </p><p>Google Analytics uses a pageview-driven paradigm, a holdover from what was important in the early 2000s. Its focus on pageviews helps answer questions such as how many users came to your website, what pages they visited, and how they found your website. Unfortunately, it isn't able to help you figure out which specific actions a user performed on any given page of your website. For example, it doesn't answer whether a user clicked on a CTA button, if they abandoned their cart, how far they got into signing up, or what part of the page they were looking at before they converted. Answering these kinds of questions can be quite informative to early-stage startups' decision-making, and can be accomplished quite easily by using an event-based analytics tool.</p><p>An event-based tool will provide two things: an interface to collect "events", and an interface to analyze those events. You can define and implement your events (commonly referred to as instrumenting) by calling the API of the event-based analytics tool you're using.</p><p>To illustrate, let's say you run an ecommerce store. You want to figure out what types of items people checkout without hesitation, and what types of items often result in abandoned carts. This isn't something that can be accomplished with pageview-based analytics tools such as Google Analytics. However, this can be performed quite easily with an event-based analytics tool. If you track two events — when someone adds something to their cart, and when someone checks out their cart — you can figure out which SKUs lead to a high checkout rate, and which SKUs lead to abandoned carts. This is implemented by calling two functions: </p><ol><li><p>a function <code>track('add-to-cart', {&lt;metadata&gt;})</code>, including metadata about the item added (e.g. SKU, name, price) in your code that executes when someone adds something to cart, and </p></li><li><p>a similar function <code>track('checkout', {&lt;metadata&gt;})</code> in your code that runs when someone checkouts. Data from these events will be sent to your analytics provider, which will provide an interface to analyze and draw conclusions from your data.</p></li></ol><p>This is a simple example, but is already quite a powerful tool to understand your users, and can be easily extended. The same power generalizes beyond an ecommerce store to any startup's web product, helping one answer essential questions such as: Is your CTA convincing? What are the characteristics of products that customers are the most hesitant about buying? What part of the signup process needs to be improved to prevent potential users from dropping off? Which portion of your product page was the most engaging and persuaded customers to take the next step?</p><h3 id="early-stage-startups-and-their-analytics-dilemma">Early-stage startups and their analytics dilemma</h3><p>If event-based analytics are so important for early-stage startups, one might rightly wonder why so many YC startups, whose founders are quite sharp in aggregate, rely primarily on Google Analytics?</p><p>It turns out that this is a rather illuminating question. The main contributor to this phenomenon is easy to understand and empathize with. Startups are busy and overworked, and analytics are often ostensibly seen as orthogonal to the priorities of understanding their users and building product<span></span><span>The <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-essential-startup-advice/">canonical priorities</a> for early-stage startups.</span>. Therefore, event-based analytics often fall to the wayside as they typically require engineering time and discipline to maintain. If you forget to update an event, or don't have time to implement analytics for a new feature, then you can't get any benefit out of it at all.</p><p>Yet, in reality, event-based analytics are one of the best sources of new product insights and inspiration and are a fantastic way to understand how your users are using your product. This is one of our main motivations for writing this particular guide. Early-stage startups have a unique set of challenges to face, particularly around prioritizing their time and engineering resources. That said, we think that there's an approach that can make event-based analytics require a lot less discipline, and therefore make it a lot more attainable for an early-stage startup.</p><h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2><p>Based on a few years of first-hand experience using and testing event-based analytics tools, in addition to aggregating feedback from other founders, we have found the following factors matter most for early-stage startups choosing an analytics tool:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Core Analytics Functionality</strong> refers to the standard analytics features that are critical for an early-stage startup to understand their users. These include standard analysis tools, such as funnel analysis (i.e. figuring out when users drop out in each step of a process), retention analysis (i.e. figuring out how many users churn, and when), and cohort analysis (i.e. figuring out how different user segments interact with your product). </p></li><li><p><strong>Robustness / Ease of Maintenance:</strong> Early-stage startups need to use analytics just as much as larger companies, but also have to be a lot more resourceful and focused with their time and energy. What happens if you change a component, and don't update the tracking code? What happens if you're under time pressure from a customer and make the conscious decision to launch a complex product without tracking? While large companies have the ability to implement strict QA processes and are okay with extended deadlines, early-stage startups don't have these options. Therefore, we've kept a close eye out for how each analytics tool performs under less-than-ideal situations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Affordability:</strong> Web analytics tools are somewhat notable/notorious for giving generous free plans, attaining lock-in, and then making things more expensive once your company starts becoming successful <span></span><span>This is one of the reasons why <a href="#consider-using-segment-as-a-wrapper">we suggest using Segment</a>, since it helps you avoid vendor lock-in and gives you more negotiating power.</span>. That said, several analytics tools have generous free tiers or deals that can last you quite a long time without paying. Therefore, we've split this criterion into two subcriteria: <strong>How far you can get without paying</strong>, and <strong>Paid Plan Affordability</strong>. The latter is actually somewhat non-trivial to evaluate, because most analytics providers hide their pricing behind a Contact Us gate, even for early-stage startups. That said, we got our hands on a decent amount of data on the actual cost of each service, and we have also compiled a list of typical discounts and deals that you can reasonably expect to get from each analytics provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ease…</strong></p></li></ul></div></div>

<p>During the eight years I spent as an engineering manager, I regularly tracked how I spent my time. As a startup engineering manager, I was responsible for a wide range of duties, so keeping track of which areas I spent the most time on helped me plan and schedule appropriately.</p>
<p>For example, I knew that I typically spent about 1/3rd of my time helping my team solve technical problems or pairing with teammates. Knowing this, I reserved some free blocks of time for them. If my whole week were full of meetings and big-picture planning, I’d become a blocker for my team who needed my input on specific issues.</p>
<p>Since many prospective software engineering managers ask me about my job and what it entails, I decided to create this detailed look at how I spent my time. While every company and role is different, I hope this post gives you some first-hand insight into a day in the life of an engineering manager.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you’re looking for some books to help you on your journey as a software engineering manager, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/reading-for-engineering-managers">here are some of my favorites</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-does-an-engineering-manager-do">What Does an Engineering Manager Do?</h2>
<p>First, a little bit about my roles as an engineering manager: my first management role was at <a href="https://www.packback.co/">Packback</a>, a question and answer platform for college professors.</p>
<p>I joined the team when there were just four people in the company - it was essentially myself and the founders. In the intervening three years, I saw the company raise close to $5 million and grow to almost 30 people. My engineering team was pretty lean - there were five when I left in 2016 - but my role changed quite a bit over my years with the company.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/joining-the-graide-network">I left Packback to join The Graide Network</a>, I started over as an engineering manager. Initially, my team was just a contractor and me, but over my four years at Graide, I <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">hired three other engineers</a> and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/product-management-process">took on more of the product management duties</a>.</p>
<p>While my day-to-day work changed a lot over the years, <strong>as a software engineering manager, I was ultimately responsible for helping my team ship software that worked as expected on schedule and within budget.</strong></p>
<p>The tricky word there is “helping.” What does that mean exactly? Does it mean that an engineering manager writes code? Or do they just make sure everyone on their team is writing code?</p>
<p>The short answer is: it depends.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-managers-must-be-technical">Engineering Managers Must be Technical</h3>
<p>Generally, engineering managers write less code than the senior developers on their team, but <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/do-engineering-managers-need-to-write-code-d89903d68e8d">they should write some code to keep their skills sharp</a>. They also need to be good at helping their team members get “unstuck.” Sometimes this means answering technical questions, and sometimes it means solving disputes between team members.</p>
<p>They’re likely to play a role in <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/developing-talent">training new engineers</a> as well as evaluating candidates on a technical and interpersonal basis.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-managers-have-to-be-good-with-people">Engineering Managers Have to be Good with People</h3>
<p>Being “good with people” is a tough label to nail down.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/e7ML5PR.gif" alt="I have people skills! - Office Space"></p>
<p>Many people assume that you have to be an extrovert to be an effective manager, <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/are-extroverts-the-best-leaders-maybe-not.html">but that’s not necessarily true</a>. Having empathy for your team and helping them through challenges - both technical and personal - is one of an engineering manager’s primary mandates.</p>
<p>But, engineering managers have to “manage up” as well. This means they need to look out for their team’s best interests when their boss asks them for feedback, and it means they might have to let a team member go if they’re not getting the job done.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardest-part-about-engineering-management">The Hardest Part About Engineering Management</h3>
<p>As I moved into my first management role, the most challenging part was adjusting my method for self-evaluation. Nickolas Means says it well in his <a href="https://leaddev.com/self-care-burnout/learning-love-meta-productivity">fantastic piece on meta productivity for managers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every so often, I have a day where I look up after the last meeting has ended and feel like I’ve gotten absolutely nothing done. I’ve been busy all day long: having conversations, reading documents, and checking in with peers and team members. I’m exhausted, but I’ve accomplished nothing.” - Nickolas Means</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was <em>relatively</em> easy for me to tell how productive I had been as a software engineer. I usually made progress on shipping a feature or opened up a pull request, but as a manager, I had a really hard time telling whether my day was productive or not.</p>
<p>That’s why I started tracking my time. While time spent on a task is not a perfect measurement of productivity, it helped me make sure I was investing enough time into each area of my job.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-an-engineering-manager-spend-their-time">How Does an Engineering Manager Spend Their Time?</h2>
<p>Engineering managers tend to have a wide range of responsibilities, and these responsibilities vary based on the employer’s size and organizational structure. To help you see how an engineering manager spends their time, I broke my time down into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical</strong> (35%)</li>
<li><strong>Managerial</strong> (35%)</li>
<li><strong>Recruiting</strong> (15%)</li>
<li><strong>Administrative</strong> (15%)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, you’ll see how I spent my time as an engineering manager. I’ll offer a little bit about the specific tasks encompassed in each area and why it was an important part of my daily work.</p>
<p>While I tracked my time pretty rigidly for periods of my 8-year management career, I decided to round each category to a nice round number for the sake of simplicity. Exact hours spent on each task aren’t the point here, but I found it helpful to know if one area spiked in one week or dropped sharply in another.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tx9pTaz.png" alt="engineering-manager-time"></p>
<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>
<p><em>35% of my time.</em></p>
<p>Technical work includes writing code, code reviews, hunting down bugs, pairing with teammates, and reading software updates and best practices. As my teams grew, the amount of time I devoted to writing and reviewing code dwindled, but I do think it’s important for engineering managers to spend at least <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/engineering-managers-should-code-30-of-t/240165174">some of their time elbows deep in the code</a>.</p>
<h3 id="managerial">Managerial</h3>
<p><em>35% of my time.</em></p>
<p>This includes direct people management, creating timelines, strategic planning, and meetings with technical and non-technical team members. Making sure my team was happy, advocating for them in business meetings, and helping our product team create technical specs were all part of my engineering manager duties at Packback.</p>
<p>At The Graide Network, I took a more strategic role by consulting with the founders on software choices and jumping in on important sales calls. Interestingly, while the tasks I took on were different, the time breakdown was pretty similar.</p>
<h3 id="recruiting">Recruiting</h3>
<p><em>15% of my time.</em></p>
<p>Recruiting time included going to conferences, meetups, and coding bootcamps, writing blog posts, meeting with job candidates, and evaluating technical screenings.</p>
<p>While I spent more of my time on recruiting when I had an open engineering job, smart engineering managers are <em>always</em> hiring. The best candidates are usually the passive ones who rarely look for a job, so I spent a portion of my time getting in front of them each week.</p>
<h3 id="administrative">Administrative</h3>
<p><em>15% of my time.</em></p>
<p>Finally, I spent a few hours per week reading and writing emails, answering questions in Slack, random conversations, and “other” day-to-day things to support my team. As the manager, I tried to keep these kinds of distractions away from my engineering team, but I’d schedule time with team members when necessary.</p>
<p>If an engineering manager’s job is to make their team as productive as possible, it stands to reason that most of the administrative work will fall to them.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-engineering-manager">What Makes a Good Engineering Manager?</h2>
<p>I don’t think I can give you <em>everything</em> you need to know about being a good engineering manager in just one blog post (<a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/reading-for-engineering-managers">here are some good books on the topic though</a>), so I’ll just pick the three things that I focus on first.</p>
<h3 id="1-empower-your-team">1. Empower Your Team</h3>
<p>Being a good manager is all about <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/articles/1999/01/successful-engineering-management-7-lessons-learned/">helping others achieve great things</a>.</p>
<p>This means that as a manager, your <a href="https://leaddev.com/self-care-burnout/learning-love-meta-productivity">impact is much less direct</a>, and therefore, you can’t spend all your time heads down in the code. It was frustrating for me to see my weekly accomplishments list shrink, but once I learned to accept that my team was getting more done without my individual contributions, I started to really enjoy the role.</p>
<h3 id="2-overcommunicate">2. Overcommunicate</h3>
<p>Whether your team is working in one room or working <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/managing-remote-engineering">remotely across the world</a>, communication is one of your most crucial roles as a manager. In marketing, there’s an idea that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-nagging-repetition-effective-communication-marton-jojarth/">people must hear your message seven times before they internalize it</a>, and I think this applies to team communication as well.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you should repeat everything seven times in the same meeting, but think about reiterating significant changes in one-on-ones, group settings, via email, and in passing. Change is scary, but the more people hear about something, the less scary it tends to be.</p>
<h3 id="3-be-the-source-of-calm">3. Be the Source of Calm</h3>
<p>Finally, as the engineering manager, your role is to “<a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/07/07/dont-create-chaos.html">vacuum up chaos</a>:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. Good leaders can walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and get everyone aligned on a clear path forward.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t create or perpetuate drama, divide your team from the rest of the company, or pit team members against each other. Instead, be the one who absorbs uncertainty and stress so your team can get sh** done.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you’re an aspiring engineering manager or you’re just wondering what your boss does all day, I hope this helps you.</p>

      <section id="Post__Main-Content">
        <div>
          <h2 id="discovering-the-problem">Discovering the Problem</h2><p>Startups are swallowing corporations' markets. This is mainly because corporations struggle with innovation, regardless of how much they use that word in press releases and PPT presentations. About 7 years ago we started <a href="http://www.codelitt.com/">Codelitt</a>, a corporate skunkworks and product incubator company. We build startups for corporations and invest 20% of our time in building products, tools, and <a href="https://github.com/codelittinc">open source projects</a> for the web. </p><p>In the beginning, we didn't set out to discover a specific problem. Put another way, we weren't being purposeful about searching for a problem to solve. This post is half about the problem with corporate innovation and half about our discovery process that led us to where we are today:</p><h2 id="eye-opening">Eye-opening</h2><p>In the beginning of my career I worked for investors in Latin America helping to build and launch startups before later moving to corporate America. Although I'm often critical of corporate culture, it was really eye opening and integral to my career. Really this is one of the best pieces of advice I can give to entrepreneurs looking for problems to solve:</p><blockquote>If you are smart and ambitious but can't find a problem to solve, go work for a large (preferably traditional) corporation. You'll find plenty there.</blockquote><p>Large enterprises succeed <em>in spite</em> of themselves. It really is a wonder that they get anything done at all. I can't speak for every single large company, but I've worked with quite a few. In one way or another they all have systemic issues. This is not to say that startups or more modern tech companies don't have their own issues. We do. But the proof is in the pudding and startups are launching products monthly that will take a huge chunk of traditional companies' markets or even render them completely irrelevant.</p><p>Some large enterprises have realized that their biggest threat isn't another corporate giant, it's some unknown kid building something. In order to compete, they have to create new value, do a little disruption of their own, and start shipping.</p><blockquote>However, traditional companies spend millions in R&amp;D and take several years to come to market.</blockquote><p>So the question is, why are they at such a disadvantage when their seemingly endless budgets should afford them a solid advantage? The answer is that the same tools, systems, and culture that they rely on to manage their large organization don't work for innovation and skunkworks teams.</p><h2 id="decisions-by-consensus">Decisions by Consensus</h2><p>Traditionally the vast majority make decisions by consensus. Note: there is a difference between collaboration and consensus. Collaboration takes different points into account but can still have one decision maker, whereas consensus decision making requires every single person to have input and be onboard. This is crippling to organizations. Teams should have a single decision maker.</p><p>Any startup who has experienced the sales cycle of a large company can attest to this first hand. While many sales people focus on identifying "the decision maker level," this person is rarely the only decision maker and they'll likely have an entire team to convince. When making a sales pitch (even for a $1,000 a month SaaS product) you'll very likely spend time in a room of 12 or so people from different areas of the company. Most of those people will likely have different needs and agendas. The same is true when it comes to developing new products, processes, or strategy. Decision making time is multiplied by an exponential factor.</p><blockquote>In the time it takes a large organization to make a decision just to move forward with something, a startup could have built, launched, and validated a new feature or model.</blockquote><h2 id="corporate-it">Corporate IT</h2><p>There are a number of reasons why normal innovation processes, product prototyping, and building new business models is so costly inside a large organization. Time is a huge factor. A close second is the cost of actual development. As with everything, I'm sure there are reasons for why things are done the way they are done. But from a product development perspective and coming from the startup world, they are nearly impossible to understand.</p><p>Corporate IT departments have a hard time looking at a product as something that develops. They see a project as having a start date, an end date, and a full set of features. There is no iterative development. They plan for every possible scenario and build to the full spec. Version releases begin with 1.0.0 launch and following releases are security patches at best.</p><p>Instead of using open source tools, large IT teams are locked in to Microsoft and Oracle products. I've never been able to understand why this is completely. It could be the fact that they spend a solid chunk of time earning Oracle or Microsoft Certifications. It could be the comfort of having support just a phone call away. Or it could even be an unwillingness to learn something new. </p><p>From a security perspective, it's like looking for a babysitter to watch your kids, asking for her recommendations, and she tells you, "Just trust me. I promise your child is secure. But just so you know, we'll be doing things my way; your house rules don't apply."</p><p>From a time perspective, there are open source technologies that allow you to whip up an MVP in much less time. Even with complaints about Rail's "magic under the hood," you can't deny that it's a powerful tool to quickly build a prototype.</p><p>From a cost perspective, licenses are expensive and they add up quickly. Millions of dollars are spent on IT licensing every year by large orgs. Imagine if that money was spent on employing core devs for the respective clients like we've seen with Red Hat, Bitpay, and Google.</p><blockquote>Developing a new product or business can often cost millions to develop with the traditional IT infrastructure and business processes. Timelines, again, are measured in years, not weeks.</blockquote><h2 id="risk-averse">Risk-averse</h2><p>The final piece to the puzzle which impedes progress and innovation is often a risk-averse nature. Being risk-averse is 'consultant speak' inside a large organization. Entire teams are dedicated to mitigating risk. I've heard a lot of different theories for why this is from insiders and outsiders over the years:</p><p><strong>Job security</strong> is one that gets floated around a lot. The 25 year Rolex, the benefits, and the cushy salary really don't require a whole lot. Don't upset the status quo, don't argue with the wrong people, play the politics, and work well with others. Do those 4 things and you have very little to worry about. Large companies rarely fire people who do those things. It's easy for anyone to become complacent when basic needs are taken care of. Unfortunately for them however, disruption requires risk. There's always the risk of being wrong. Being wrong is rarely celebrated in corporate culture and that stigma can follow someone around for the rest of their career preventing any sort of upward mobility. In our world, many of us have failed a few times, succeeded a couple, and worked for several companies. Our entire attitude towards failure and opportunity is a completely different perspective.</p><p>Another is the <strong>high visibility</strong> that corporations have in the public eye. Because of their size, most things they do are considered <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/journalism/news/newsworthy.html">newsworthy</a> due to the impact it could have on their customers, employees, or investors. In the startup world, we have the luxury of being able to fail relatively quietly. Our customers and beta users are usually very understanding of certain degrees of failures to the point they even expect them. Remember those corporate departments dedicated to risk management? These often include legal, public relations, and marketing communications teams. They all have the responsibility to keep the public face of the company as free from blemishes as possible.</p><blockquote>Disruption requires risk. No great invention, change, or innovation ever came from doing the same thing over and over. <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/not-innovating/">You have to be ready to break things along the way</a>.</blockquote><h2 id="their-disadvantage">Their Disadvantage</h2><p>When you begin to understand the issues that are faced by teams tasked with innovation projects, skunkworks programs, or disrupting old models you can see how simple objectives for us turn into difficult ones for them. While many of us perhaps envy their resources, they're actually at a huge disadvantage to us in every other way. They have a massive problem, one that we set out to solve:</p><blockquote>For them innovation, product development, and skunkworks is expensive, slow, regulated, ineffective, and swimming against the current.</blockquote>

December 10, 2020 | https://jonathancarter.org/2020/12/10/centos-stream-or-debian/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jonathancarter.org/2020/12/10/centos-stream-or-debian/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>It’s the end of CentOS as we know it</strong></p><p>Earlier this week, the CentOS project announced the shift <a href="https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/">to CentOS stream</a>. In a nutshell, this means that they will discontinue being a close clone of RHEL along with security updates, and instead it will serve as a development branch of RHEL.</p><p>As you can probably imagine (or gleam from the comments in that post I referenced), a lot of people are unhappy about this.</p><p>One particular quote got my attention this morning while catching up on this <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838889/">week’s edition of Linux Weekly News</a>, under the distributions quotes section:</p><blockquote><p>I have been doing this for 17 years and CentOS is basically my life’s work. This was (for me personally) a heart wrenching decision. However, i see no other decision as a possibility. If there was, it would have been made.</p><cite><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/839521/">Johnny Hughes</a></cite></blockquote><p>I feel really sorry for this person and can empathize, I’ve been in similar situations in my life before where I’ve poured all my love and energy into something and then due to some corporate or organisational decisions (and usually poor ones), the project got discontinued and all that work that went into it vanishes into the ether. Also, 17 years is really long to be contributing to any one project so I can imagine that this must have been especially gutting.</p><p><strong>Throw me a freakin’ bone here</strong></p><p>I’m also somewhat skeptical of how successful CentOS Stream will really be in any form of a community project. It seems that Red Hat is expecting that volunteers should contribute to their product development for free, and then when these contributors actually want to use that resulting product, they’re expected to pay a corporate subscription fee to do so. This seems like a very lop-sided relationship to me, and I’m not sure it will be sustainable in the long term. In <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">Red Hat’s announcement of CentOS Stream</a>, they kind of throw the community a bone by saying “In the first half of 2021, we plan to introduce low- or no-cost programs for a variety of use cases”- it seems likely that this will just be for experimental purposes similar to the <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">Windows Insider program</a> and won’t be of much use for production users at all.</p><p>Red Hat does point out that their <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi">Universal Base Image</a> (UBI) is free to use and that users could just use that on any system in a container, but this doesn’t add much comfort to the individuals and organisations who have contributed huge amounts of time and effort to CentOS over the years who rely on a stable, general-purpose Linux system that can be installed on bare metal.</p><p><strong>Way forward for CentOS users</strong></p><p>Where to from here? I suppose CentOS users could start coughing up for RHEL subscriptions. For many CentOS use cases that won’t make much sense. They could move to another distribution, or fork/restart CentOS. The latter is already happening. One of the original founders of the CentOS project, Gregory Kurtzer, is now working on <a href="https://rockylinux.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://rockylinux.org/">Rocky Linux</a>, which aims to be a new free system built from the RHEL sources.</p><p>Some people from Red Hat and Canonical are often a bit surprised or skeptical when I point out to them that binary licenses are also important. This whole saga is yet another data point, but it proves that yet again. If Red Hat had from the beginning released RHEL with free sources and unobfuscated patches,  then none of this would’ve been necessary in the first place. And while I wish Rocky Linux all the success it aims to achieve, I do not think that working for free on a system that ultimately supports Red Hat’s selfish eco-system is really productive or helpful.</p><p>The fact is, Debian is already a free enterprise-scale system already used by huge organisations like Google and many others, which has stable releases, LTS support and ELTS offerings from external organisations if someone really needs it. And while RHEL clones have come and gone through the years, Debian’s <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract">mission and contract to its users</a> is something that stays consistent and I believe Debian and its ideals will be around for as long as people need Unixy operating systems to run anywhere (i.e.  a very long time).</p><p>While we sometimes fall short of some of our technical goals in Debian, and while we don’t always agree on everything, we do tend to make great long-term progress, and usually in the right direction. We’ve proved that our method of building a system together is sustainable, that we can do so reliably and timely and that we can collectively support it. From there on it can only get even better when we join forces and work together, because when either individuals or organisations contribute to Debian, they can use the end result for both private or commercial purposes without having to pay any fee or be encumbered by legal gotchas.</p><p>Don’t get caught by greedy corporate motivations that will result in you losing years of your life’s work for absolutely no good reason. Make your time and effort count and either contribute to Debian or give your employees time to do so on company time. Many already do and reap the rewards of this, and don’t look back.</p><p>While Debian is a very container and virtualization friendly system, we’ve managed to remain a good general-purpose operating system that manages to span use cases so vast that I’d have to use a blog post longer than this one just to cover them.</p><p>And while learning a whole new set of package build chain, package manager and new organisational culture and so on can be uhm, really rocky at the start, I’d say that it’s a good investment with Debian and unlikely to be time that you’ll ever felt was wasted. As Debian project leader, I’m personally available to help answer any questions that someone might have if they are interested in coming over to Debian. Feel free to mail leader_AT_debian.org (replace _AT_ with @) or find me on the oftc IRC network with the nick <em>highvoltage</em>. I believe that together, we can make Debian the <em>de facto</em> free enterprise system, and that it would be to the benefit of all its corporate users, instead of tilting <em>all</em> the benefit to just one or two corporations who certainly don’t have your best interests in mind.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>When it comes to Twitter, we have been building a following there for some time, so it was a matter of publishing the <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo/status/1336589322670268416?s=21">right tweet</a>, at the right time, and getting the right people to retweet it.</p>
<p>For Product Hunt, we partnered with our friend <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina">Chris</a>. His followers got a notification when he hunted us, but we also did our part and emailed our lists.  That helped to get fast on the front page and to kickstart the discussion.</p>
<p>Once we were in front of enough people, the product did the rest.</p>
<p>Servers did hold up without a sweat. </p>
<p>It's crazy what you can do these days with a couple of well-configured dynos on Heroku and a Django app! We peaked at 8 RPS when we hit the HN frontpage.</p>
<p>Typefully was born as <a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">Fabrizio</a>'s personal side-project. I jumped in to make the editor crazy-fast, and write the server-side code. When <a href="https://twitter.com/meseali">Ali</a> helped us refine positioning and copy, we knew we had a winner and promoted it to an official <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a> project.</p>
<p>Plans for the future? Implement all the great feature requests we got, and monetize this thing. </p>
<p>We launched with a tip-jar system where people could become <em>patrons</em> by tipping us, but with $150 earned after a crazy launch day like this, it's clear that this is not going to pay the bills. </p>
<p>We are thinking of adding some paid features. What's free is gonna stay free though, because this was first and foremost a labor of love.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm speaking in front of 200 people tomorrow on the topic around software development for startups. There are hundreds of books written on this so I'll try to condense my learnings from most.</p><p>Even though we're a startup company at <a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a>, I stopped hiring software engineers, hell I tried to unlearn and relearn a few things in the journey as well.</p><p>Confusing I know - I still have to grapple around the entirety of it all but the honest truth is being a software engineer alone will get you easily fired or unvalued in a startup.</p><p>You need to fire yourself from that role and re-hire yourself as a product engineer. I've referenced this point multiple times in my previous articles and I really stand by this.</p><p>I don't think this necessarily applies for larger companies when they're hiring specialists and algo heavy engineers, however in a startup you need to think about the product, the marketing and most important the customer.</p><p>There is a significant disconnect in larger firms from the creator (developer) to the end user, all the way from hierarchy, to Project Managers, to Product Managers, to Marketers, to Execs etc - but in a startup, if you push code up... it's up.</p><p>So whats so special about being a product engineer that a software engineer can't do? A few things:</p><h3>1. They carry a get shit done attitude</h3><p>Sure some engineers carry that too, these statements aren't binary or exclusive but address the vast majority. When you look at github discussions or you look at conference events where people share their discoveries, it's all based around the engineer - not as much around the customer.</p><p>So yes, product engineers have a get shit done attitude, keeping in mind that they need to push good work out, but are quick on their feet to understand how much of debt some technical decisions will be vs others. This will be understood better over time, and even after a decade of programming, I can confirm that there is no right or wrong answer, its extremely situational based.</p><h3>2. Business first, software second</h3><p>You should toughen up and realise that building on the latest and greatest tech will not make you a better engineer. You almost NEVER have as much a good reputation for being the engineer for a bad startup as you may of a good startup, even though your code in the bad startup might be worthy of awards and your code in the good startup might be worthy of firing. It's inherent you see - good code isn't coincidentally in good companies, its because the companies made the smart decision of hiring mini-CTOs, people who understood that their customer mattered as much as their code.</p><p>This doesn't mean you give up all morals and build on PHP(I'M JOKING :p), but it kinda does. Not PHP but any language that is deemed unfit just because it's popular or not. You do a direct risk analysis on what will get me to my next goal ASAP. Whether that's faster iteration, more features or modularised code bases.</p><h3>3. Customer first, business second</h3><p>It should all come down to how you can make the life of the customer as easy as possible when you're solving the problem for them. Sometimes business requirements become business requirements and not customer requirements, and if you're just a software engineer by title, you will be doing what you're told to do because thats the limitation you have, at least the limitation I had a couple of years ago.</p><p>By stepping out of that box and understanding that if the business requirements step outside of the customer requirements, you get to voice your opinion and more importantly add the kicker to your "opinion" by justifying it with your technical abilities, techies are badass, we're the makers, so in the end if we have the knowledge around consumerism AS well as execution, it'll make us bulletproof.</p><p>So yes, if you're in a startup - don't work as a software engineer, work as a product engineer. Your impact will be 10X I kid you not.</p><p>People will take you ALOT more seriously, you'll climb the ranks faster, your code will matter a lot more, and the impact will be at scale. Your work matters and there should be no reason why more people shouldn't experience your genius code, the way you can make that happen is by being product focused and ensuring your customers are having the best time of their life.</p><p>As with any post, I'm always always looking to learn and become better at what I do, so I'd love to hear what you have to say, good or bad 🙌</p><p>If you liked this, definitely follow me on for the similar stuff:</p><p>twitter: twitter.com/<a href="https://dev.to/veebuv">@veebuv</a><br>linkedin: linkedin.com/in/vaibhavnamburi<br>instagram:_veebuv</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>Recently I found myself needing to process and visualize both point clouds and meshes in an iOS application utilizing ARKit, with the point cloud being gathered using the 2020 iPad “LiDAR” sensor. To enable maximum performance and content creation convenience I thought it would be nice to have both custom shaders and a regular, easy-to-work-with 3D hierarchy available. The best options available seemed to be Metal and SceneKit, which required some initial setup to get working together. That setup is detailed in this post.</p>
<p><em>If all this sounds unfamiliar see <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/lidar-peek-into-the-future-with-ipad-pro-11d38910e9f8">here</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/2243-scene-kit-tutorial-getting-started">here</a> for introductions to these technologies.</em></p>

<p>To help you recreate what I did, the post is accompanied by a GitHub repository showing the specifics: <a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal">github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note that the repo uses slightly confusing naming. XCode project name is “smTest” (for “SceneKit Metal test”), which leads to combinations such as smTestTest for the auto-generated unit testing project… not the best choice, but bear with me.</em></p>
<p><em>Also note that this is not really beginner level stuff, nor is having both SceneKit and Metal rendering usually required. If you just want to do some 3D+AR on iOS, good tech to start with would likely be either <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/">RealityKit</a>+<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/creating_3d_content_with_reality_composer">RealityComposer</a>, the more widely applicable tool <a href="https://tutorialsforar.com/creating-an-ar-app-for-ios-using-unity-and-arkit/">Unity</a> or just plain <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/building-an-ar-app-with-arkit-and-scenekit/">SceneKit</a>.</em></p>

<p>RealityKit seems like the future, but I was interested in custom shaping of meshes at runtime with e.g. geometry shaders and there did not (yet?) seem to be hooks for integrating that kind of processing in RealityKit.</p>
<p>Turns out those hooks do exist in SceneKit, which is an older and more mature technology. They can be used to implement custom render steps either before or after regular rendering. A helpful blog post with details that aided me with the ‘<strong>renderer didRenderScene</strong>’ hook can be found here: <a href="https://rozengain.medium.com/custom-metal-drawing-in-scenekit-921728e590f1">Custom Metal Drawing in SceneKit</a>. Thanks for the writeup Mr. Ippel!</p>
<p>I chose to get started with combining ARKit, SceneKit and custom Metal rendering by mashing two of Apple’s example applications together:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Scene Depth demo app (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/visualizing_a_point_cloud_using_scene_depth">Visualizing a Point Cloud Using Scene Depth</a>)</li>
<li>The default SceneKit AR project created by the XCode project wizard (creation steps depicted below)</li>
</ul>

<p>The trickiest part was to get the depth blending working correctly. SceneKit and the custom Metal renderer of the Point Cloud demo use different depth buffer conventions, which caused a few moments of initial confusion before realizing I would have to adjust depth settings to make them compatible.</p>
<p>Initial depth buffer ranges <em>(from memory, might be incorrect)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SceneKit:</p>
<ul>
<li>empty = zero</li>
<li>growing towards camera</li>
<li>range around 0.00-0.05</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>SceneDepthPointCloud Metal renderer</p>
<ul>
<li>empty = negative infinity(?)</li>
<li>shrinking towards camera</li>
<li>range around 1.0-9.9995</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make the depth blending behave nicely and consistently, it was needed to set the proper depth blending mode (<em>shown as DepthStencilState –&gt; DepthCompareFunction in the XCode Frame Debugger</em>), to find matching value ranges for both depth buffers and to keep the 3D scenes of both renderers in their respective camera frustums (having good values for znear and zfar) so that they would not get culled off by being too near or too far.</p>

<p>If you’re working in a recent Apple dev environment in a fairly empty project, there’s a good chance you can get started with GPU debugging right away. You just need to build and run your app and press the camera icon (and wait a bit):</p>

<p>If you crave more in-depth GPU debug options or have trouble getting started, more info can be found on the page about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/frame_capture_debugging_tools">Frame Capture Debugging Tools</a> as well as the guide page for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/frame_capture_debugging_tools/enabling_frame_capture">Enabling Frame Capture</a>.</p>

<p>For more specific details on how I combined the two renderers, see the changes included in the first few commits (Nov 24th &amp; 28th) on the <a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commits/main">commits page</a> of the example repository. It shows the history of how I:</p>
<ul>
<li>started with a blank SceneKit AR project using the Project Wizard (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/3d5358507d2824d0d57335d6988ec81d20291b9d">Initial commit</a>)</li>
<li>added custom Metal rendering as per Mr. Ippel’s <a href="https://rozengain.medium.com/custom-metal-drawing-in-scenekit-921728e590f1">post</a> (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/75ad32f2012594ba3c09df9f351299d64f0ecb59">draws simple triangle, …</a>)</li>
<li>copied in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/visualizing_a_point_cloud_using_scene_depth">SceneDepthPointCloud</a> demo and made sure the application still builds (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/cbcdaf130a288a7ad68cd2a848ddd671269b93d6">builds with SceneDepthPointCloud …</a>)</li>
<li>fiddled with accumulation settings etc confusedly to get the thing closer to working (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/39ba6d28e7f22ae202e20344c503a2136932f3ff">almost works …</a>)</li>
<li>and finally adjusted the depth blending, depth range and camera frustum settings to be able to see both scenes together (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/4a60df6c60b380d72ec740171c3440ffa09ddc23">improved …</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/39c9a0e7a997567ca978e1190b67cd2af9790666">draws both …</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result of all these steps can be seen in motion below. It is of course merely the starting point for a more interesting application that leverages the ease and speed of regular 3D asset workflows and selectively applies the power of customized GPU processing as needed.</p>



<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/485931370?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>At the time of first publication of this post (Dec 2020) I’m not sure if the depth buffer is entirely in sync between the two renderers, even though they both do render simultaneously. The point cloud looks alright behind the rocketplane(? 😄), but I’m not sure whether they behave correctly in overlap situations. However, the fix should be just a matter of adjusting camera and depth buffer parameters and possibly scene scale (<em>famous last words…</em>).</p>
<p>If and when time permits, I will update the post and the repository with improved details.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>A few weeks ago I was in a bad place.</p>

<p>My product Pegasus—a <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">Django boilerplate for SaaS applications</a>—was 
having its worst sales slump in recent history.
Meanwhile, my other product, Place Card Me—an <a href="https://www.placecard.me/">online place card maker</a>—continued
to be hit hard by the pandemic, with sales down almost $10,000 from 2019.
It looked like I was going to fall short on my targets for the month. 
<em>Again</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/place-card-me-2020.png" alt="Place Card Me"></p>

<p>The grey line is Place Card Me’s profits in 2019. The purple line is 2020. Thanks, Covid.</p>

<p>And then on a lark I thought, “well maybe I’ll try running a Black Friday sale.”</p>

<p><strong>And my month’s trajectory completely changed.</strong></p>

<p>A few hours of work and a week later, and I had shattered my previous earnings for any month—earning
more than 3 months’ worth of typical profit in a single week.</p>

<p>Through the process, I learned a lot about running sales—lessons I thought I should share.
Because Black Friday <em>is</em> a huge opportunity for online creators and indie hackers. 
One that—if you’re anything like me—you’re probably not taking full advantage of.</p>

<p>Here’s what I did and what I learned along the way.</p>

<h2 id="deciding-to-run-a-sale-by-overcoming-the-ickiness-factor">Deciding to run a sale by overcoming the “ickiness factor”</h2>

<p>If you’re like me, your first reaction to the idea of a Black Friday sale might be something along the lines of 
“ugh, those are so overdone and spammy”.
And it’s true, Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales have become ubiquitous online.</p>

<p><em>But Black Friday sales aren’t inherently bad.</em></p>

<p>Many consumers, including myself, happily take place in Black Friday deals.
They’re a great way to support creators and pick up products you’ve long considered buying.</p>

<p>To get over my fear of “Black Friday ickiness”, I decided to turn to other successful creators who were also running deals.
Adam Wathan and Steve Shoger of <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> / <a href="https://refactoringui.com/">Refactoring UI</a>;
online educator extraordinaire <a href="https://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>;
fellow solopreneur <a href="https://mtlynch.io/">Mike Lynch</a> for his product <a href="https://tinypilotkvm.com/">TinyPilot</a>.
How were they doing Black Friday and what could I learn from them?</p>

<p>My favorite example came from Wes Bos, which <a href="https://marketingexamples.com/">Harry’s Marketing Examples</a>
did a great job analyzing:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/wes-bos-black-friday.jpeg" alt="Wes Bos Black Friday"></p>

<p>Wes Bos’s “masterful” Black Friday email. Image and analysis from <a href="https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1331573176405536769">Harry’s Marketing Examples</a></p>

<p>This email and the others I looked at all shared similar qualities.
They were <em>genuine</em>, they <em>put the reader first</em>, and they <em>weren’t too pushy</em>.
It was “hey, here’s a great deal in case you’re interested, if not, sorry to bug you.”</p>

<p>Seeing that it was possible to run a deal in a classy way was enough to get me over the “ickiness” factor,
and provided a framework for crafting my own sales communications.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: Running a sale doesn’t have to be “icky” if you do it right.</strong></p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-sale-structure-by-adding-value">Choosing the right sale structure by <em>adding value</em></h2>

<p>People expect Black Friday deals to offer a huge discount from normal prices—particularly 
for online products. Here’s a typical deal I received, with bundle of fonts being offered at 95% off 
the normal price:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/wild-ones-black-friday.png" alt="Wild Ones Font Bundle"></p>

<p>A typical Black Friday deal—offering 95%-off a bundle of commercial fonts.</p>

<p>Offering a huge discount is a great way to drive sales, but it comes with a huge cost. 
<em>Literally</em>. A big discount will substantially reduce your revenue-per-customer and 
leave money on the table.</p>

<p>And that’s not the only problem.</p>

<p>In addition to the lost revenue, <em>massive discounts devalue your product</em>.
If your customers know that you sometimes sell your product for 95% off, they’re likely 
to think it’s only worth 5% of it’s price.
<em>You’ve just turned your valuable good into a commodity.</em></p>

<p>So how do you run a sale without reducing your prices? <strong><em>You add value.</em></strong></p>

<p>Take Adam Wathan and Steve Shoger’s deal.
They took their two products, <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> (normally $249) and 
<a href="https://refactoringui.com/">Refactoring UI</a> (normally $149), and bundled them together for $279.
Their customers are simultaneously <em>saving $120</em> while <em>paying more than the price of either individual product.</em>
This is adding value at its finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/refactoring-ui.jpg" alt="Refactoring UI Black Friday"></p>

<p>The Tailwind UI / Refactoring UI deal—which used bundling to offer 30% off while simultaneously increasing prices.</p>

<p><em>Bundling</em>—what Adam and Steve did by offering two products together at a discount—is a great way to 
add value while not lowering prices.
A similar approach is to <em>offer increased benefits on a lower pricing tier</em>. 
This is the approach I took with my own product.</p>

<p>My product, <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">SaaS Pegasus</a>, is designed to help people launch new web applications quickly.
Pegasus has two pricing tiers, a <em>single-site</em> version for $295, and an <em>unlimited</em> version for $750.
The product is the same, but the single-site version is only able to be used on—well—a single site,
while the unlimited version can be used on—you guessed it—unlimited sites.
The unlimited version also comes with lifetime updates to Pegasus itself, instead of just a year.</p>

<p>Anyway, the details aren’t important, but what <em>is</em> important is that more than 90% of my customers 
opt—at least initially—for single-site. 
So for my Black Friday deal I decided to offer the unlimited version at price of single-site. 
This allowed me to offer a 60% discount without significantly reducing my revenue per customer
or devaluing my product.</p>

<p>Whether you use bundling, the “increased benefits on a lower tier” approach, or something else, 
adding value is a great way to create a “Black Friday deal” feeling while not incurring 
some of the financial and psychological costs associated with heavy discounting.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: Don’t lower prices, add value.</strong></p>



<p>Ok, you’ve gotten over the ickiness factor and you’ve chosen a sale structure that adds value.
Now’s the most important part: <em>spreading the word</em>.</p>

<p>When considering how best to get the word out, think of the following breakdown.
Everyone is either <em>interested</em> or <em>not interested</em> in your sale.
Likewise everyone will either <em>find out</em> or <em>not find out</em> about it.
This creates four buckets that any person might fall into:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/sale-matrix.png" alt="Sale Categorization Breakdown"></p>

<p>Breakdown of the possible ways people can experience your sale.</p>

<p>The two green boxes are what you’re aiming for. 
Of course, you want everyone who might be interested in the sale to find out about it—these are your potential customers!
Also, you want everyone who <em>isn’t</em> interested in the sale to not get spammed by it—the blissfully unaware.</p>

<p>The tradeoffs and mistakes happen in the red boxes.
What you really want to prevent is <em>lost customers</em>—people who would have been interested in the deal
but never knew it was happening.
You also want to annoy as few people as possible, but <em>it’s generally better to promote the deal to someone who wasn’t interested
than to have someone who was interested miss it</em>. 
The upside of a potential sale clearly outweighs the downside of mildly annoying someone.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: Default to promoting everywhere that the signal-to-noise ratio isn’t terrible.</strong></p>

<h3 id="where-to-promote-your-sale">Where to promote your sale</h3>

<p>The key avenues for promotion—in order of importance—are your <em>website</em>, your <em>email list</em>, and <em>other online marketing channels</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Your website is your best source of potential customers.</strong></p>

<p>No one is more likely to be interested in your deal than someone who is already browsing your product website,
so you should do everything you can to ensure all website visitors see your deal.</p>

<p>I used the common technique of splashing a big-ass colorful banner on every page of the site.
Here’s what it looked like.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/pegasus-sale.png" alt="Pegasus Sale"></p>

<p>Don’t be shy promoting your sale on your website. These are the people most likely to benefit from it.</p>

<p>Your goal is to make it impossible for someone visiting your website to not hear of the sale,
so err on the side of flashy, even if it seems a bit much.</p>

<p><strong>Your email list is your next best source of potential customers.</strong></p>

<p>People on your email list were interested in your product at one point, and so are more likely
than almost anyone else to still be interested, so make sure to let them know!</p>

<p>My email sequence consisted of two mails:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An email at the start of the sale telling people about it.</li>
  <li>An email with 24 hours left in the sale telling people it was about to end.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some people add a third email in the middle—often with 48 hours to go. 
I don’t recommend more than 3 emails as you seriously risk pushing people 
further into the “annoyed” category.</p>

<p>In terms of email copy—you can’t do better than the Wes Bos example above.
But for the sake of transparency, here’s the mail I used:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/pegasus-email.png" alt="Pegasus Email"></p>

<p>The first email in my sequence announcing the Pegasus Black Friday deal.</p>

<p>One difference between Wes and I is that my email list is <em>cold</em>—I almost never use it.
So I added a reminder for people who might be wondering what Pegasus even was.
I also included details on some new features to show that I’m still improving the product.</p>

<p><strong>All other channels besides your website and email list are a distant third in terms of usefulness.</strong></p>

<p>For this reason, I severely limited promotion in other places unless they were 
specifically aggregating Black Friday deals—and therefore unlikely to annoy anyone.</p>

<p>Depending on your product and audience, social media can be a good channel, though it’s not for Pegasus
so I didn’t bother promoting there.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>It’s important to realize that unless you did something very wrong, 
<strong><em>people will be more likely to purchase your product during a sale than at any other time.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now, if you’ve taken the advice above and are still getting good revenue-per-customer during
the sale, there is an interesting side-effect:
<strong>website traffic <em>during a sale</em> is more valuable than at any other time</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ll show you just how much more valuable it was for me in the next section <em>(preview: it was way more than I expected)</em>.</p>

<p>In practice, this means that any additional effort you can expend to get people to your website—for any reason—will 
have a higher payoff during a sale.</p>

<p>How you leverage this information depends on your marketing strategy.
If you’re running ads, consider increasing your budget while the sale is running;
if you do content marketing, consider publishing your next big article during the sale, etc.
These efforts—while not necessarily directly related to the sale—will have the side-effect of getting
more eyes on your site at the exact moment your …</p></div></div>

			<blockquote>
  <p>This is the story of how close we came to shutting down before even launching our first product, how we survived, and the lessons we learnt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In March, 2020, when COVID hit the world, our startup Milkie Way too was hit with a big blow and almost shut down. <strong>We burnt $72,000 while exploring and internally testing Cloud Run with Firebase within a few hours.</strong></p>

<p>In November 2019, after having the idea, I started developing <strong>Announce <a href="https://annc.in/">https://announce.today</a></strong>. The goal was to create an “MVP”, a functional V1 of the  product, and for this reason our code was based on a simple stack. We used JS, Python and deployed our product on Google App engine.</p>

<center>
<em>Announce on Desktop</em>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/post_images/anc-first-look.png" width="100%"><br>
</center>

<p>Having a very small team, our focus was on writing code, designing the UI and getting product ready. I spent minimal time in Cloud management, just enough to make us go live, and have basic development flow (cicd) going.</p>

<p>In the V1 web application, user experience was not the smoothest, but we just wanted to make a product that some of our users could experiment with, while we built a better version of Announce. With Covid hitting the world, we thought it was the best time to make a difference as Announce could be used by the governments to make announcements world wide.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to have some rich data on the platform even if users don’t create content to begin with? This thought that led to another project, called <strong>Announce-AI</strong>. It’s purpose was to create rich content for Announce automatically. Rich data == events, safety warnings like earthquakes, and possibly local relevant news.</p>

<h3 id="some-technical-details">Some Technical Details</h3>
<p>To begin developing Announce-AI, we used Cloud Functions. As our bot scraping the web was fairly young, we believed light weight Cloud functions were the way to go. However, as we decided to scale, we ran into troubles because Cloud Functions have a timeout of ~9 minutes.</p>

<p>At this time we learn about Cloud Run, which then had a big free usage tier! Without understanding it completely, I asked my team to deploy a “test” Announce AI function on Cloud Run, and see it’s performance. The goal was to play around with Cloud Run, so we can learn and explore it really fast.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/cloud-run.jpg" width="80%"><br>
<em>Google Cloud Run</em></center>

<p>To keep it simple, as our experiment was for a very small site, we used Firebase for database, as Cloud Run doesn’t have any storage, and deploying on SQL server, or any other DB for a test run would have been an over kill.</p>

<p>I created a new GCP project ANC-AI Dev, set up $7 Cloud Billing budget, kept Firebase Project on the Free (Spark) plan. The worst case we imagined was exceeding the daily free Firestore limits if we faltered.</p>

<p>After some code modifications, we deployed the code, ran it by making few requests in middle of the day manually and then left it.</p>

<h3 id="nightmare-begins">Nightmare Begins</h3>
<p>Everything went fine on the day of test, and we got back to developing Announce. Next day after working, I went for a quick nap in late afternoon. On waking up I read few emails from Google Cloud, all sent within few minutes of each other.</p>

<center>
<em>First Email: Auto upgrade of our Firebase Project</em>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/auto-upgrade.jpg" width="80%"><br>
</center>

<center>
<em>Second Email: Budget Exceeded</em>

<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/budget.jpg" width="80%"><br>
</center>

<p>Luckily my card had a spending limit of $100 preset. This led to declining the charges, and Google suspending all our accounts with it.</p>

<center>
<em>Third email: Card was declined</em>

<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/card-declined.jpg" width="80%"><br>
</center>

<p>I jumped out of the bed, logged into Google Cloud Billing, and saw a bill for ~$5,000. Super stressed, and not sure what happened, I clicked around, trying to figure out what was happening. I also started thinking of what may have happened, and how we could “possibly” pay the $5K bill.</p>

<p>The problem was, every minute the bill kept going up.</p>

<p>After 5 minutes, the bill read $15,000, in 20 mins, it said $25,000. I wasn’t sure where it would stop. Perhaps it won’t stop?</p>

<p>After two hours, it settled at a little short of $72,000.</p>

<p>By this time, my team and I were on a call, I was in a state of complete shock and had absolutely no clue about what we would do next. We disabled billing, closed all services.</p>

<p>Because we used same company card across all our GCP Projects, all our accounts and projects were suspended by Google.</p>

<h3 id="nightmare-continues">Nightmare Continues</h3>
<p>This happened on Friday evening, March 27th, 3 days before we had planned V1 of Announce to go live. Our product development was dead as Google suspended all our projects as they were tied to same credit card. My morale was as low as it could be, and the future of our company was unsure.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/suspended.jpg" width="80%"><br>
<em>All our Cloud Projects were suspended; development stopped</em></center>

<p>Once my mind made peace with this new reality, at midnight I sat down to actually investigate what happened. I started writing a document detailing all the investigations… I called this document: “Chapter 11”.</p>

<p>Two of my team members who were in this experiment also stayed up all night investigating and trying to make sense of what had happened.</p>

<p>The next morning on Saturday, March 28th, I called and emailed over a dozen law firms to book an appointment / have a chat with some attorney. All of them were away, but I was able to get response from one of them over email. Because the details of the incident are so complicated even for engineers, explaining this to an attorney in plain english was a challenge of its own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a bootstrapped company, there was no way for us to come up with $72K.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this time, I was well versed with Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of Bankruptcy and mentally prepared of what could come next.</p>

<h3 id="some-breather--gcp-loopholes">Some Breather : GCP Loopholes</h3>

<p>On the Saturday after sending emails to lawyers, I started reading more and going through every single page in GCP Documentation. We did make mistakes, but it didn’t make sense that Google let us spend $72K without even making a payment on the project before!</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/firebasegcp.jpg" width="80%"><br>
<em>GCP and Firebase</em></center>

<h4 id="1-automatic-upgrade-of-firebase-account-to-paid-account">1. Automatic Upgrade of Firebase Account to Paid Account</h4>
<p>We never anticipated this, nor was this ever displayed while signing up for Firebase. Our GCP project had billing connected to have Cloud Run execute, but Firebase was under Free plan (Spark). GCP just out of the blue upgraded it, and charged us for the amount it needed to.</p>

<p>It turns out this is their process as “Firebase and GCP are deeply integrated”.</p>

<h4 id="2-billing-limits-dont-exist-budgets-are-at-least-a-day-late">2. Billing “Limits” don’t exist. Budgets are at least a day late.</h4>
<p>GCP Billing is actually delayed by at least a day. In most of their documentation Google suggests using Budgets and auto shut-off cloud function. Well guess what, by the time the cut off function would trigger, or the Cloud Users be notified, the damage would’ve probably been done.</p>

<p>Billing takes about a day to be synced, and that’s why we noticed the charges the next day.</p>

<h4 id="3-google-was-supposed-to-charge-us-100-not-72k">3. Google was supposed to charge us $100, not $72K!</h4>
<p>As our account had not made any payment thus far, GCP should’ve first made charge for $100 as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-cycle#find-threshold-amount">per billing info</a>, and on non-payment, stopped the services. But it didn’t. I understood the reason later, but it’s still not the user’s fault!</p>

<p>The first billing charge made to our account was of ~ $5,000. The next one for $72,000.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/automatic-payments.jpg" width="100%">
<em>Billing threshold for our account was $100</em>

</center>

<h4 id="4-dont-rely-on-firebase-dashboard">4. Don’t rely on Firebase Dashboard!</h4>
<p>Not just Billing, but even Firebase Dashboard took more than 24 hours to update.</p>

<p>As per Firebase Console documentation, the Firebase console dashboard numbers may differ ‘slightly’ from Billing reports.</p>

<p>In our case, it differed by <strong>86,585,365.85 %</strong>, or 86 million percentage points. Even when the bill was notified to us, Firebase Console dashboard still said 42,000 read+writes for the month (below the daily limit).</p>

<h3 id="new-day-new-challenge">New Day, New Challenge</h3>
<p>Having been a Googler for ~6.5 years and written dozens of project documents, postmortem reports, and what not, I started a document to share with Google outlining the incident, and adding the loopholes from Google’s side in a postmortem. Google team would come back to work in 2 days.</p>

<p>EDIT: Some readers suggested that I used my internal contacts at Google. The truth is that I haven’t been in touch with anyone, and I used the path that any normal developer / company would take. Like any other small developer, I spent countless hours on chat, in consults, lengthy emails, and bugs. In one of my next posts on how to look at incidents, I’d like to share the doc/postmortem I sent to Google during this incident.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/googleplex.jpg" width="40%"><br>
<em>Last day at Google</em></center>

<p>Another task was to understand our mistake, and devise our product development strategy. Not everyone on the team knew what was going on, but it was quite clear that we were in some big trouble.</p>

<p>As a Googler I had experienced teams making mistakes costing Google millions of dollars, but the Google culture saves the employees (except engineers have to write a long incident report). This time, there was no Google. Our own limited capital and our hard work, was at complete stake.</p>

<hr>

<p>This post is already getting long, so I’ll continue the details of how we managed to make this blunder, how we survived, and what did we learn.</p>

  				 <p>December 2020</p>

<p>If your product moves money on behalf of customers, and you manage the ledger, you need reconciliation. You can think of recon as the process of making sure every transaction in your system matches one in the external world. For every dollar you’ve moved, an external entity agrees with the amount and direction, and has provided “documentation” to that effect.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a few performant recon systems that came under stress as they scaled, and I’ve worked with startups at early enough stages that getting recon right was not existential. I’ve also never built a recon system from scratch. Everything I'll say here is from the perspective of a user of recon systems rather than a maker of them. I’ve been a customer of a couple, and their performance impacted my output so I have strong opinions about what I wish would exist. Since I'm not sure what a perfect recon system would look like, I'm writing this to flesh out the thought, and to smoke out anyone who already knows.</p>
<p>I’ve interacted with reconciliation systems aimed at two types of problems:</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of transactions</h2>
<p>Transaction oriented recon makes sure that some external party agrees with every money movement in your ledger. I saw this philosophy in the recon systems I interacted with at Cash App &amp; Square in general. In this model, the objective is to make sure that every money movement action matches your intention. This means the state of the transaction, the direction, and the amount are what you expect. A secondary objective is ensuring the timing matches your intention. This is secondary because in a lot of cases, the actual precise timing doesn't matter as long as it happens&nbsp; "soon", and as long as the underlying accounts aren’t run at a $0 balance. In this case reconciliation solves an accounting problem, ensuring money movements are correct. It also helps ensure that the company's receivables and payables are complete, is useful for regulatory &amp; financial audits, and empowers your treasury team to make good cash management decisions. I suspect most acquirers (Stripe, Square, Adyen, etc.) at least start by pursuing transaction oriented recon.</p>
<p>Typically in an acquiring world, you construct the “internal” ledger from the settlement/capture messages generated by the card networks. This is what product teams look at to inform customer facing features. You construct the “external” ledger from settlement files generated by the acquiring bank. Accounting teams look at the external ledger (technically accounting teams look at both ledgers, but product teams rarely look at the external ledger on an ongoing basis).</p>
<p>A recon system often includes an engineering team paired with an operations team, working together. In cases where the internal and external ledgers disagree, a human (on the ops team) reviews the data. They determine what’s causing the exception, whether it's systematic, how frequently it occurs, and what to do to fix it. The eng team continually optimizes the process to reduce the exception rate over time. Transaction oriented recon primarily solves accounting problems. You’re typically working towards SLAs designed for monthly/quarterly earnings close, and your outputs feed into income/cash flow statements.</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of balances</h2>
<p>Balance oriented recon ensures precise amounts in bank or customer accounts on a periodic basis. You use the same internal and external ledgers as in transaction oriented recon. However, you're comparing not only the amounts, state and direction of a transaction, but also its timing. This type of recon system can be useful for accounting, but is ideal for building systems that report a balance at a point in time. One example is a banking system of record. In the case of a system of record, a balance oriented recon system informs customer-facing balances and FDIC insurance.</p>
<p>Balance oriented recon systems are required for organizations that issue instruments and are the final source of truth for their own ledger. Most financial technology companies today rely on the ledgers managed by their infrastructure providers. For instance, if you issue cards, the banking as a service platform typically connects to the bank’s core, and most traditional bank cores have a balance oriented recon framework built in.</p>
<p>For context - in order to provide FDIC insurance to customers, banks are required to provide an auditable record of customer balances at any point in time. This is usually solved by being able to provide a daily snapshot of customer balances. This function is one of several provided by core processors, and as a result most core processors have a balance oriented recon process built in by default.</p>
<p>However if you’re the rare card issuer managing your own ledger (or really building any kind of financial product where you’re responsible for your own ledger, such as a digital wallet where you own the money transmission licenses), you’ll need to build a balance oriented recon system eventually. It's the way you’ll be sure you have the money that you’re telling customers you have.</p>
<h2>Common Problems in Recon</h2>
<h3>Adding a new money movement type to a single balance</h3>
<p>One overarching problem that affects all recon systems is what happens when new types of money movement impact a balance. For instance, imagine you run a digital wallet where your primary funding and cash-out transaction types are ACH debits and credits. Also, imagine you’ve built a perfect reconciliation system, with the combination of technology and human process that allows you to tie out balances and payments with zero failures (this is super unlikely). The moment you add payment cards as funding/cash out instruments, you now have a different external ledger to integrate with. It will have different edges than you're used to. You'll deal with potentially different organizations, who have different processes for resolving exceptions. No matter what you do, this will take time to get right, and long after your new feature is launched, you’ll probably discover new, undocumented quirks. Some of these quirks will only be clear when you’re processing money movements at scale. I’ve seen cases where the incorrect MID set with a card network resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars routed to the wrong (internal) account. Survivable error as the transactions were reconciled in aggregate, but bad for accounting and distraction caused to cross functional team members pulled in to swarm the problem.</p>
<h3>Timing differences between authorization and settlement</h3>
<p>For balance oriented reconciliation systems in particular, solving timing problems is critical. Timing problems typically occur when a) the payment authorization time and the settlement time are different, and your system’s not necessarily aware, b) you’re dealing with payment types where the settlement amount can be adjusted multiple times c) your ledger updates customers balances when a new payment authorization comes in, rather than a settlement message. In all these cases you’re grappling with a few questions (I don’t actually know the right answers to these):</p>
<ul>
<li>When should you update a customer’s balance? When you know there is a transaction (when the auth comes in) or when amount is finalized (when the settlement comes in)</li>
<li>When the authorization and settlement amounts are different, do you retroactively adjust the balance for the day the authorization came in? Or do you fix that in place and only adjust the balance with the delta on the day the settlement arrives?</li>
<li>Is your snapshot on a particular day immutable (i.e. it can never be adjusted) and if so, how do you handle changes in amounts between the authorization and the settlement?</li>
<li>Traditional core systems will have an available balance (which is how much you can access, with pending transaction amounts removed), and an account balance (which includes pending transactions, and is typically higher than the available balance).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relying on aged systems for exception handling</h3>
<p>Very often you work with a wholesale bank whose systems are seasoned and handle the majority of exceptions using manual workflows. This can be frustrating; you’re faced with either adopting their manual processes, which bind your cost structure to theirs, or accepting a higher exception rate temporarily while you build technical systems around their process. There’s no easy trade-off here.</p>
<h3>Early prototyping and float problems</h3>
<p>In the course of product development you’ll often prototype by adding new money movement types to your ledger. A lot of these prototypes (as should happen) will be discarded. Despite this, they will have moved real money and affected your real ledger, and (at least for your accounting team's sanity) you’ll need a stateful way to reconcile the money that moved to your ledger. While at Cash I once spent a year integrating into 6 card issuer processor systems while prototyping the Cash Card. With each integration we needed a float (depositing funds with the card issuer so we could test transactions in the real world) which meant our accounting team now had 6 new banking relationships to monitor, 4 of which lasted less than 6 months, but all of which required material floats amounts. In a few cases, the issuer processor didn’t actually enable us to manage our own ledger, so we’d have a parallel ledger (one on our databases and a mirror on theirs) that we’d have to keep in sync. There was at least one integration that we ultimately discarded, which took us several months to reconcile, long after we’d walked away from the partnership. How you handle these cases will depend on what’s financially “material” for your organization. In our cases, prototype floats were all sub $100k, so survivable at our scale. But tracking these down repeatedly was an insane level of tedium.</p>
<h3>Managing ledgers across many internal bank accounts</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll contract with multiple banks for different financial services. For instance one bank for merchant acquiring and another for …</p></div></div>

<p>Welcome to CellSol!</p>
<p>This website and its associated project are now in beta! Come take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/RbtsEvrwhr-Riley/CellSol/">GitHub</a></p>

<p>What if the internet and cell phone towers went down for more than a few hours - or during an emergency situation? No communication could lead to lost lives.</p>

<p>The end goal of the project is to have a widespread network able to handle low-bandwidth traffic (text, compressed images) for a large number of users, to fill gaps when the larger Internet is unavailable.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency, the CellSol network, much like the Internet, can be used as a knowledge base, as well as a rally point, giving people a tool to use to coordinate and organize even if 
other communication systems go down. We intend to scale the design, with long-haul routing capabilities, so that regional networks can intercommunicate and interoperate, allowing for a wider breadth of use cases.</p>

<p>The overall design is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">mesh network</a> of <a href="https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora">LoRa</a> devices, called “Pylons”
that act as repeaters (extending the range of the network). Terminals (devices that users access the network with) also repeat packets, so that a network
made up entirely of end users is possible.</p>
<p>The two basic types of pylons are the ESP32 WiFi Pylon (a terminal device) and the Ardunio Repeater Pylon (a pure repeater, but can have bluetooth to use as a terminal).</p>
<p>Pylons with more specialized uses, such as data repositories for local emergency resources (phone numbers, shelter locations, etc.) and knowledge bases (such as a Wikipedia mirror) are also intended to be
developed in the future, to add to the overall usefulness of the network.</p>

        <div>
          <p>It is a really great time to be a developer.</p>

<p>We have tons of APIs integrated within great tools for building dynamic, full stack apps. If you are a developer, you probably are using technologies like schemaless data stores, serverless architectures, JSON APIs, and/or the GraphQL language.</p>

<p>Further, there are a bunch of cool frameworks like the <strong>Jam</strong>stack (<strong>J</strong>avaScript, <strong>A</strong>PIs, and <strong>M</strong>arkup) and services like Netlify to make it fast to deploy a serverless app.</p>

<p>And now, for the first time ever, Apache Cassandra is a part of this stack because <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/">Stargate is now live on Astra</a> as the official data API.</p>

<p>The modern apps we build need data APIs which integrate into our toolset and work with native data shapes (JSON, REST, GraphQL, etc). These data APIs need to support schemaless JSON, while simultaneously providing speed and scalability.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it better only take a few minutes for us to use them within our project.</p>

<p>DataStax built <a href="https://stargate.io/">Stargate</a> into Astra to give us, app developers, a natural data API stack which meshes with the Jamstack (or serverless stack of your choice). Stargate in Astra is built on the rock solid NoSQL data engine (Apache Cassandra) which powers Netflix, Instagram, Yelp, iCloud and other apps we all use everyday.</p>

<h2 id="what-exactly-is-stargate">What exactly is Stargate?</h2>
<p>Stargate is an <a href="https://stargate.io/2020/09/14/init-stargate.html">open source data gateway</a> that sits between your app server and your databases. Stargate brings together an API platform and data request coordination code into one OSS project.</p>

<p>Multiple successful app companies - like Netflix and Yelp - built their own data gateways to help internal app developers create features using simple APIs, without needing to learn the underlying database or mess with schema.</p>

<p>DataStax integrated Stargate into Astra to give you the same power and ease of access to your data.</p>

<p>What does this mean for you?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No upfront data modelling needed for Documents.</li>
  <li>Less custom code to maintain.</li>
  <li>More time to build what you care about.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/stargate-astra/stargate-astra.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/stargate-astra/stargate-astra.png"></p>

<p>You can work with your data the way you want – JSON via schemaless document APIs or database schema aware GraphQL and RESTful APIs – while Stargate serves as the proxy that coordinates these requests to different flavors of Cassandra.</p>

<p>To see it in action, let’s see how this works by using JSON with Stargate’s schemaless Document API in a TikTok clone. Because, if Instagram and Snapchat have a TikTok clone, we should have one, too. Right?</p>

<h2 id="real-quick-note-first">Real Quick Note First</h2>

<p>Slinging JSON to and from Apache Cassandra without data modeling is just too much fun. You gotta <a href="http://astra.datastax.com/">try this out in Astra for yourself</a>. You can get <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/documents-api">hands on with it right away</a> or check out our <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/sample-app-gallery">sample app gallery</a> to see schemaless Cassandra in action.</p>

<p>We are stoked to have engineers from Netflix, Burberry, Macquarie Bank, USAA, and Yelp creating Stargate with us. They are already hard at work battletesting the APIs and collaborating on new features.</p>

<p>Ok, onto the code!</p>

<h2 id="posts-in-tiktok">Posts in TikTok</h2>

<p>We are going to walk through using Stargate’s APIs in Astra for creating and updating posts within a TikTok clone. We’re walking through examples that are ready to be pasted into your latest Jamstack app.</p>

<p>To use Stargate in Astra in your app, first install and set up our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrajs/collections">JavaScript SDK</a>. You can learn about storing environment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSmzEGZQI5A">variables in your .env file here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a basic TikTok post: a video with a caption, like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>postData</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>postId</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>video</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://i.imgur.com/FTBP02Y.mp4</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>caption</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>These ducks are cute</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>timestamp</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>2020-12-09T09:08:31.020Z</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>likes</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After connecting to Stargate in Astra with a nodejs client, let’s create a new collection in our app and add the post with:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>postsCollection</span> <span>=</span> <span>astraClient</span><span>.</span><span>namespace</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>tikTokClone</span><span>"</span><span>).</span>
  <span>collection</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>posts</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>postData</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’ve ever used Cassandra before, you know this is amazing. Look at what we didn’t do: no data modeling, no table creation, no configuration code, no partition keys, no clustering columns. I think you get my drift.</p>

<p>Stargate in Astra allows you to add data to Apache Cassandra in one line of code.</p>

<p>This level of ease of use hasn’t previously been possible with Cassandra. Insert JSON and move on.</p>

<p>Next up, let’s say you want to find all posts about ducks. You can do that via:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// find all posts about ducks</span>
<span>const</span> <span>posts</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>({</span> <span>caption</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>{</span> <span>$in</span><span>:</span>  <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>ducks</span><span>"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And boom. Now you have your ducks channel all set up for your users. Because who doesn’t want a stream fully dedicated to ducks?</p>

<p>Now, your app isn’t going to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/twitter-fleets-reactions-memes-edit-button-1548037">be like Twitter</a>. We can edit stuff here. Let’s show how to edit your post’s caption. Stories tho? That’s on you</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// update the post’s caption</span>
<span>const</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>caption</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>These ducks are MEGA cute</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above was just a quick tour on how to do a few data API calls for a basic TikTok clone. Want to see the full thing? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IATOicvih5A">Ania Kubow</a>’s tutorial to see how to wire this up into a full React app with Netlify.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>For more examples, we have hands-on tutorials for using <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/rest">Stargate’s REST</a>, <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/documents-api">Document</a> and <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/graphql">GraphQL APIs</a>. Check ‘em out and let us know what you think.</p>

<p>Have an app idea or want to join the fun? <a href="https://discord.gg/2Xt8QNyFZA">You can join the Stargate community, too</a>.</p>

<p>We would love to see how you customize your TikTok clone to show off more ways to feature data in your app. Or, you can create your own non-TikTok example. We would love to showcase your example in our <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/sample-app-gallery">sample app gallery</a>, so tell us about it in <a href="https://discord.gg/33mKDHHFUE">our contribute channel</a>.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-are-down-here-looking-for-a-few-more-details">So, you are down here looking for a few more details</h2>
<p>If you came down here, maybe you are looking for a few more lines of code.</p>

<p>No problem.</p>

<p>Let’s show how to set up the node JS client and a few more data API calls. For starters, let’s take a look at how to set up your client to connect to Stargate in Astra.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// npm install @astrajs/collections</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>createClient</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>@astrajs/collections</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>// create an Astra client</span>
<span>const</span> <span>astraClient</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>createClient</span><span>(</span>
<span>{</span>   <span>astraDatabaseId</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_ID</span><span>,</span>
    <span>astraDatabaseRegion</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_REGION</span><span>,</span>
    <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_USERNAME</span><span>,</span>
    <span>password</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_PASSWORD</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Easy enough.</p>

<p>Then, let’s create a users collection in our database to store documents about our TikTok users:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create the users collection in the app</span>
<span>const</span> <span>usersCollection</span> <span>=</span> <span>astraClient</span><span>.</span><span>namespace</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>tikTokClone</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>collection</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>users</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A TikTok user in our app will have the basics: a unique id, a name, username, etc.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>userData</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>id_3</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>name</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Mo Farooq</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>username</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>mofarooq32</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>avatar</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://i.imgur.com/9KYq7VG.png</span><span>"</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, let’s add our user into our collection:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a new user</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>userData</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can check to make sure your user was stored in the database by reading the user back by any of their properties, like their username.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// find our user by username</span>
<span>const</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>({</span> <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>$eq</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>"</span><span>mofarooq32</span><span>"</span> <span>}</span> <span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Or, you can lookup a user by their <strong>documentId</strong>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// get the user by document id</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And, lastly, if you need to delete that user:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// delete the post</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Want to see the full code? Check out <a href="https://github.com/kubowania/stargate-tik-tok">Ania Kubow’s app</a> to get all the goodness and start customizing it on your own. Let me know when you have stories up and I can subscribe to your ducks channel.</p>

<p>Thank you for following along all the way down here.</p>

<p>Happy building!</p>

                    <p>There's a ton of resources scattered around the web dealing with code review fundamentals, best practices, tools, etc. In this article we'll summarize the lessons from a dozen of official company engineering blogs. You can find links to the original articles in <a href="http://localhost:8080/blog/code-reviews"></a><a href="https://blogboard.io/search?searchQuery=code%20review">this blogboard search</a>.</p><h2 id="what-s-in-this-article">What's in this article?</h2><p>We'll cover several topics:</p><ol><li>Why do code reviews?<br>Besides the obvious, quality assurance, there are other benefits to code reviews</li><li>Code reviews as quality assurance<br>We'll cover the general recommendations on what to look for in a code review, why having a review checklist is beneficial, and you'll get a fairly long checklist that you can use as a base for your own list</li><li>Code reviews as a team improvement tool<br>If you've done more than a few code reviews, you know they're useful for more than just preventing bugs. We'll summarize common views on how reviews are beneficial as a learning and team bonding tool</li><li>Preparing a pull request for review<br>Lessons for pull request authors. There are rules of thumb consistently pointed out that help to prepare a PR for a smooth review</li><li>Reviewing code - Be human!<br>Lessons for reviewers on how wording and tone of your comments can make a huge difference in effectiveness of the whole review effort.</li></ol><p>The topics are covered fairly independently, so if you're curious about a particular topic feel free to skip ahead.</p><h2 id="why-do-code-reviews">Why do code reviews?</h2><p>It should be obvious that the primary purpose of code review is to assess quality of the changes being introduced. I mean, the dictionary definition of <em>review </em>says precisely that</p><blockquote><strong>review</strong> <em>(noun) - </em>a formal assessment of something with the intention of instituting change if necessary.</blockquote><p>Of course, code being code, there's a lot of things that can be checked and tested automatically, so there's nuance to what actually needs to be checked in an actual code review. We cover that in the next section.</p><p>On the other hand, code review is a form of communication between the <em><strong>author</strong> </em>of the change (these days usually <em>a pull request</em>) and one or several <em><strong>reviewers</strong>. </em>So it has side effects that go beyond preventing bugs from slipping in or keeping the codebase consistent in terms of style and architecture. </p><p>When done well, code reviews help accelerate learning across the team, create psychological safety for all team members, help establish and communicate best practices, teach proper communication and improve team dynamics. When done poorly, they can help deteriorate all of the above.</p><h2 id="code-reviews-as-quality-assurance">Code reviews as quality assurance </h2><p>There are a bunch of ways in which code reviews help maintain the quality bar for the codebase and the product. In the end it comes down to catching mistakes at the level which can hardly be automatically tested, such as architectural inconsistencies. Also, the code for automated tests should be reviewed, so there's a meta level at which reviews help with QA. </p><p>In <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/high-leverage-code-reviews/">Giving High Leverage Code Reviews</a>, Casey Rollins advocates for having a checklist with all the usual things that need attention. </p><blockquote>When I’m reviewing a pull request, I often do multiple “passes” where I focus on one attribute at a time. I start at the beginning and review the pull request with a single attribute in mind before moving on to the next. When I’ve worked through the checklist, I submit the review.<p>This checklist moves from general to specific checks because it’s important to focus on the high-level attributes first. It doesn’t make sense to offer a variable name suggestion if you’re also suggesting that an entire class or function be refactored.</p></blockquote><p>You can have your own checklist or make it a shared list for the team or a project. There's a ton of material written on the usefulness of checklists. In <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>, </em>David Allen puts forward a simple idea -<em> </em>our minds are great at processing information, but terrible at storing and recalling it. That's why checklists are a great way of externally storing and breaking down a planned or repetitive task.</p><p>Compiled from several articles (<a href="https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/effective-code-reviews-53d62a203b2f">1</a>, <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/high-leverage-code-reviews/">2</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">3</a>) here's a high-level list of things to be concerned about when reviewing a code change:</p><ul><li>Story alignment - does the change meet the requirements of the task at all; ie. does the code implement any and all of the specified functionalities?</li><li>Consistency across the codebase</li><li>Architectural considerations - how does the new piece of code fit the existing architecture. Can the new feature architecture be improved, is it too generic or not extensible enough?</li><li>Simplicity/over-engineering</li><li>Performance concerns - are there specific cases (eg. peak load times) when the code will break? Do the queries pull more data than necessary? Could new queries benefit from adding new indexes to the database?</li><li>Accidental errors such as typos or errors in math formulas - these can be either obvious or really tricky to notice, especially with math heavy code</li><li>Compliance with laws and regulations - depending on the business this might be the most important thing</li><li>Security concerns - are there any exploitable pieces of code being introduced? Are any secrets being shared or stored unsafely?</li><li>Readability and style - a seemingly perfect piece of code might not be immediately understandable and readable to a different pair of eyes. Is it possible to understand the changes without the author explaining them?</li><li>Best practices - programming languages usually have their best practices - are they met in the pull request? Also, with time any project, team and company will evolve their own set of best practices - code reviews are a way to enforce and spread knowledge about them</li><li>Localization - are all language dependent resources localized properly?</li><li>Dependencies - are there external libraries or APIs being introduced? Are there other simpler/faster/better ways to do this with different dependencies or without any?</li><li>Interactions and side effects - how does the new piece of code interact with the rest of the codebase; does the new function implementation break any existing functionality; are all relevant unit tests updated/added</li><li>Logging - it's practically impossible to debug server code properly without good logging. Is everything logged/traced correctly</li><li>Error handling - how are the errors handled on the backend; how are they communicated to the user; are fallbacks activated where possible?</li><li>Testability/Test coverage - is the new piece of code covered with automated tests? Have all the suspicious test cases been checked either automatically or manually? Is the code written in a way that's suitable for unit testing?</li><li>External documentation - in case it's necessary is the external documentation updated to reflect the change?</li></ul><p>It's a pretty long list. In addition to it, a recurring piece of advice is not to use code reviews in place of static code analysis tools. If your review is mostly about code formatting, variable naming and alphabetical ordering, it might be a good time to include an automated code analysis tool into your development workflow.</p><p>In <em><a href="https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/effective-code-reviews-53d62a203b2f">Effective Code Reviews: Bettering Products, Teams, and Engineers</a> </em>from PayPal engineering<em>, </em>Gabriel McAdams points out several important benefits of code reviews related to team dynamics:</p><ul><li>Team cohesion - by making everyone's code subject to peer review, code review process promotes <em>individual accountability, healthy conflict</em> and the idea that everyone's<em> working together</em> to make the product better. As said in <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">Code Review Best Practices</a>: <em>Code reviews are classless: being the most senior person on the team does not imply that your code does not need review.</em><br>In summary, McAdams puts it nicely: <em>Trust + healthy conflict + individual accountability + working together to better the team = team cohesion.</em></li><li>Free career improvement training - simply by virtue of reviewing other people's code you become more skilled at reading and understanding new code. I've heard it said that one of the foremost traits of great engineers is the ability to dive into and dissect a completely unfamiliar piece of code. Over time you learn how to spot common practices, little tricks, pieces of syntactic sugar, architectural abstractions and how to appreciate different mental models used to solve the same problem.</li></ul><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">Code Review Best Practices</a> from the Palantir Blog, Robert Fink lists several ways in which knowledge sharing and social side-effects happen via code reviews:</p><ul><li>Authors are motivated by the peer review process to do all the necessary pre-checks, tighten the loose ends and generally tidy up the code before sending to review</li><li>A code review explicitly communicates changes made to product functionality to team members</li><li>The author maybe used a technique, abstraction or an algorithm that reviewers are unfamiliar with. The opposite can also be the case - reviewers might be aware of a more appropriate way to solve a given problem</li><li>Positive communication strengthens social bonds within the team (might especially be true for remote teams)</li></ul><h2 id="preparing-a-pull-request-for-review-help-the-reviewer">Preparing a pull request for review - help the reviewer</h2><p>Code reviews should be seen as a team effort. Once you view them that way it becomes clear that both sides - the author and the reviewers - have their distinct sets of responsibilities.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.engineering/the-code-review-mindset-3280a4af0a89">this short post</a> on Medium Engineering blog, Xiao Ma describes how a different perspective changes the way code reviews are done, how feedback is taken and how people on each side benefit by adopting a <em>positive mindset</em> about code reviews.</p><p>When we talk about the responsibilities of the pull request author, there are several key things recurring in all code review guides.</p><ol><li><strong>Make pull requests as atomic as possible</strong><br><a href="https://shopify.engineering/great-code-reviews">At Shopify</a> they advise to keep <em>your pull requests small </em>- it helps the reviewer dive into it and finish it as an atomic piece of work in their workday. In practice this can mean keeping your pull requests limited to <em>a single concern. </em>A single concern here means a single bug fix, a feature, an API change etc. Don't mix refactoring that doesn't alter behavior with bug fixes or new features. This is …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>I wrote this post as a result of my frustration with popular business books and with non-fiction books in general. I am not saying every book is like this, some books are insightful and bring new ideas and perspectives to the table. But I have noticed that some authors have an idea and without fleshing it out and properly researching it they decide to write a book about it. Throw in cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias and an incompetent publishers and you have got yourself a popular non-fiction book. There is no peer review and if you sensationalize things you can earn a lot of money. </p>
<p>You cannot even trust books by experts in the field. I bought into the hype of the book Why We Sleep  by Matthew Walker the author seemed legit and well respected within his field. He even appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience. After reading the book I  began espousing the benefits of 8 hour sleep until I read <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">this</a> wonderful article by Alexey Guzey. So who should you trust? Should you stop reading non-fiction altogether? I suggest doing the opposite, read as much as you can and be wary of any broad sweeping statements. Even though some books might get something wrong, the good ideas are still valuable. And as with business you can only get better at it (i.e. filtering signal) by exposing yourself to more of it.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>The traditional CentOS Linux distribution as we know it is dead. Here is another drop in the ocean of opinion pieces that follow the news of its death. After cooling down from the initial rush of blood to my head, here is my take on this event.</p>

<h2>Why Did This Probably Happen</h2>
<p>With the advent of DevOps and SRE, businesses and startups are moving away from the old-school concept of traditional server clusters to running their applications on disposable containers. The trend is clear and true. Developers are increasingly less reliant on a tried-and-true Linux distribution that lasts for a decade. With containers, developers can develop, test, deploy, and rollback with blazing fast velocity.

</p><h2>How It Will Affect All of Us</h2>
<p>Without a doubt one of the most popular Linux distributions to ever exist, CentOS was prevalent among all kinds of computing systems ranging from simple database servers to billion-dollar computer clusters. There are countless organizations have made the business decision to keep using the traditional model, or organizations that do not require microservices at all. With CentOS drawn from below their feet, a lot of organizations will be forced to migrate to another option, or fork out a pretty penny for RHEL. Besides, on-prem deployment of any container orchestration tool still requires a stable Linux distribution.</p>

<p>The second ripple effect it will have is towards the skilled professionals who have spend decades on CentOS. Not every company is willing to pay up for RHEL or risk using CentOS Stream. For those who migrate to Debian or OpenSUSE, they will have to retrain and adapt with different tools.</p>

<h2>Questioning IBM/Red Hat Decisions</h2>
<p>The most obvious of them all was, was it necessary for CentOS to die? With CentOS Stream to track ahead of RHEL, it is still possible for CentOS to remain functional and serve its purpose. This is clearly a business decision to increase profits. It used to be that developers wanted to write for RHEL but did not want pay for it; CentOS filled that need. What also happened was that some companies decided that they wanted the free experience all the way. Red Hat now provides free use of the Red Hat Universal Base Image for developers. With this, companies no longer have an excuse.</p>

<p>Secondly, why the PR disaster? In hindsight, there is no way to deliver this news gently to the public. However, I felt that Red Hat gave the bird to the open source community, especially those who contributed to CentOS, by pulling the plug on Centos 8 towards the end of 2021. There wasn't even a courtesy to end it later then CentOS 7's EOL date, June 30th 2024. A raw-dogged "Pay up, now" to everyone. </p>

<p>Last of all, what is the next move from Red Hat/IBM? With CentOS gone, there is a huge vacuum for another to take its place. RHEL sources are still available and can still be repackaged. While Red Hat currently has massive influence over Linux in general, is this a arrogant statement proclaiming "Hey, you can't live without me"? Another ominuous take with conspiratorial undertones would be that Red Hat plans to eventually scrap the FOSS model, but I would have to wear my tin hat for this one.

</p><h2>So, What Happens Now?</h2>
<p>Almost immediately after the release, all the attention is now directed to towards filling the space that CentOS will leave behind. Undoubtedly, Ubuntu and SUSE would try to assert their presence with their open source alternatives. Debian, the largest behemoth of them all, hopefully will receive funding and participation like never before. A silver lining of this event would perhaps be the buzzing excitement of what will be and can be. It is time to be excited about Linux again. I, for one, have to begin migrating my CentOS containers and virtual machines to Debian.</p>

        <div><p>Over the past weeks and months, we’ve seen people coming to YouTube to learn more about where and how to vote or learning more about a candidate or an issue. We’ve seen news organizations grow their audience. And we’ve seen people turn to YouTube for the latest election results or simply to follow an historic event with the highest voting turnout in over a century in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our main goal going into the election season was to make sure we’re connecting people with authoritative information, while also limiting the reach of misinformation and removing harmful content. The work here is ongoing and we wanted to provide an update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div><h2>Removing content that violates our policies</h2><p>Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a> prohibit spam, scams, or other manipulated media, coordinated influence operations, and any content that seeks to incite violence. Since September, we've terminated over 8000 channels and thousands of harmful and misleading elections-related videos for violating our existing policies. Over 77% of those removed videos were taken down before they had 100 views.&nbsp;</p><p>We also work to make sure that the line between what is removed and what is allowed is drawn in the right place. Our policies prohibit misleading viewers about where and how to vote. We also disallow content alleging widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of a historical U.S. Presidential election. However in some cases, that has meant allowing controversial views on the outcome or process of counting votes of a current election as election officials have worked to finalize counts.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the U.S. Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect. Given that, we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, in line with our approach towards historical U.S. Presidential elections. For example, we will remove videos claiming that a Presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors. We will begin enforcing this policy today, and will ramp up in the weeks to come.

        <div><p>Now let’s look at recommendations, one of the main ways our viewers find content. Limiting the reach of borderline content and prominently surfacing authoritative information are important ways we protect people from problematic content that doesn’t violate our Community Guidelines. Over 70% of recommendations on election-related topics came from authoritative news sources and the top recommended videos and channels for election-related content were primarily authoritative news. In fact, the top 10 authoritative news channels were recommended over 14X more than the top 10 non-authoritative channels on election-related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these encouraging results, we recognize there's always more to do. For example, while problematic misinformation represents a fraction of 1% of what's watched on YouTube in the U.S., we know we can bring that number down even more. And some videos, while not recommended prominently on YouTube, continue to get high views, sometimes coming from other sites. We're continuing to consider this and other new challenges as we make ongoing improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand the need for intense scrutiny on our elections-related work. Our teams work hard to ensure we are striking a balance between allowing for a broad range of political speech and making sure our platform isn't abused to incite real-world harm or broadly spread harmful misinformation. We welcome ongoing debate and discussion and will keep engaging with experts, researchers and organizations to ensure that our policies and products are meeting that goal. And as always, we'll apply learnings from this election to our ongoing efforts to protect the integrity of elections around the world.<br></p></div>

              <article><p>The most notable feature in <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/endbasic-0.3.html">EndBASIC 0.3</a> is its new full-screen console-based text editor. It took longer than I wanted to start developing this, in part because I was busy moving, and in part because I <em>dreaded the thought of having to unit test the text editor</em>. (Yes, EndBASIC is a personal project and I develop it in my free time, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want it to be properly engineered!)</p>

  <figcaption>The text editor we will be unit-testing, in action.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the end, I rolled up my sleeves, got to work, and achieved reasonable test coverage. In fact, the tests have already paid off by uncovering various bugs and inefficiencies, so the effort was well-spent. Developing these tests was non-trivial, though, so here is an overview on <em>why</em> it is worthwhile to unit-test a full-screen console app and <em>how</em> to go about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key insight, unsurprisingly, is to <strong>design for testability</strong>. I knew I wanted to unit-test the text editor from the beginning, so I had to come up with a design that allowed for this. Retrofitting tests into code that never considered testing is very difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As usual, while the specific code I’m going to show you is in Rust, you can easily apply these ideas to your favorite language. All you need is a mechanism to express an abstraction layer between your app and the console manipulation code—and you could do that even in the shell.</p>

<p>Command-line applications typically interact with the console by reading from their standard input (stdin) and writing to their standard output (stdout). Both stdin and stdout are “streams”: you can read from and write to them, but these I/O operations are sequential. The streams do not know anything about where the cursor is or how to change colors or anything like that. And this makes sense because if stdin and stdout are connected to files, what does it mean to “clear the screen”?</p>
<p>If that’s the case, though, how does a console program manipulate the screen to, for example, clear it and position the cursor at an arbitrary location? Well, the answer is that… it depends.</p>
<p>On Unix-like systems, the application writes special collections of bytes, known as <strong>escape sequences</strong>, to stdout. How the escape sequences look like and what they mean depends completely on what stdout is attached to. Again, if stdout is attached to a file, these sequences mean nothing more than a sequence of bytes. Contrariwise, if stdout is attached to a terminal, then the terminal interprets them and performs certain actions.</p>
<p>The most obvious escape sequence you can think of is the line terminator, or <code>\n</code>. On its own, <code>\n</code> is nothing more than ASCII byte 10. But when the terminal sees this byte, the terminal knows that it has to advance the cursor to the next line <em>and</em> move it to the first column. But the semantics of what <code>\n</code> does vary across systems: Windows interprets <code>\n</code> as <em>just</em> moving the cursor one line down, not rolling it back go the first column.</p>
<p>There are more complex escape sequences, of course. This is why you can trivially (assuming you know what terminal type you are talking to) embed escape sequences in <code>printf</code> or <code>echo -e</code> invocations to control how things look like. You essentially use escape sequences as a way to mark up the text:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2020-12-08-escape-sequences.png">
  <figcaption>Two `printf(1)` command invocations showing how escape sequences change the color of the printed text.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For completeness, I’ll also mention that the terminal emulator is usually in the kernel, which is what allows you to have full-screen text apps in the text mode console, but it can also be implemented in <em>hardware</em> (where the concept originated), and thus also in user space, which is what graphical programs like <code>xterm</code> used to do before PTYs (and is why they are called terminal <em>emulators</em>).</p>
<p>If you haven’t connected the dots yet, this is precisely what the ancient <code>TERM</code> environment variable is about: it tells the console applications what specific terminal it is talking to so that the application itself can generate the correct escape sequences to control it. Nowadays, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI escape sequences</a> are almost universal, but they weren’t always. <code>terminfo</code>/<code>termcap</code> and <code>(n)curses</code> are libraries to abstract all these details away and offer the programmer a generic console-manipulation interface that works across <code>TERM</code> variants.</p>
<p>This is all about Unix though. On Windows, things are different (and my knowledge is very limited). Command-line applications communicate with the Console Window Host (<code>conhost.exe</code>) by means of <code>ioctl</code>-like calls. In other words: console manipulation happens out of band and isn’t part of what goes into stdout. Or at least that’s the only way it used to be: the new console host supports ANSI escape sequences too, presumably to facilitate interop with WSL.</p>
<p>Anyhow. We don’t care about how the console is updated from a testing perspective: we want to know how the console changes, but not exactly how that’s done by the OS. Therefore, I’m going to refer to the escape sequences and/or the <code>ioctl</code>s sent to the console as <strong>console manipulation commands</strong> or <strong>console commands</strong> in the text below.</p>

<p>Testing a full-screen console app—which some people refer to as a <strong>Text User Interface</strong> or <strong>TUI</strong> for short—exposes essentially the same difficulties as testing a GUI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are trying to write tests for something that <strong>responds to user input</strong>, and every user interaction causes <strong>changes that are inherently visual</strong> and require the human eye for interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s break these problems down into pieces and see how we can approach them.</p>
<p>First and foremost: we have to ensure that the <em>outcome</em> of our input (key presses) has the right effect on the program <em>state</em>. Given that we are testing a text editor, this is easy: we can populate the editor’s buffer with some text, let the editor process a set of key presses, and then verify that the contents of the editor’s buffer match a golden text. Not very different from other, more traditional tests.</p>
<p>Second, we need to worry about user input. After all, the TUI is interactive and reacts to user key presses, so our tests will have to drive the TUI. This is easier than dealing with the visual console updates, as all we have to do is represent the sequence of key presses to send to the app and then feed those to it in some way. Again, this is not very different from other tests: we have an algorithm and we inject some input.</p>
<p>And third, we have to worry about how things look like, which is the most interesting part of this problem. Because, after all… we can write a test to verify that a piece of code selects the blue color and then clears the screen, but unless we <em>see</em> the result, we don’t know if the screen was all emptied with a blue background or not.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>could</em>. Presumably, we could capture the raw screen contents (or poke at them if we were in the DOS era; <code>0xB8000</code> anyone?) and compare those against golden “screenshots” after every key press. This would do the trick and would result in tests that are completely decoupled form the way the screen is updated… which actually sounds like a good idea. The problem with this approach of comparing screen contents is that we would need a terminal emulator to “render” the console from the console commands that the application emits, and a terminal emulator isn’t a trivial piece of software.</p>
<p>The alternative to this idea of comparing screen <em>contents</em> is to capture the console commands that the app emits and compare those to expectations. This is easier to implement but has different fidelity tradeoffs as we shall see below.</p>

<p>If we follow the ideas presented above, we will end up with a bunch of tests that inject key presses into the TUI and, for each of them, we will capture which console manipulation commands were emitted and we will compare them against expectations.</p>
<p>Which… sounds fragile and not particularly useful, doesn’t it? As mentioned earlier, a sequence of commands is meaningless <em>unless we humans see the visual results</em> once a terminal emulator has processed the commands. You could then say that these tests are pointless. But these tests provide three separate benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Corner-case and regression validation.</strong> In the scenario we are looking at, a lot of the editor behavior is obvious: if we press the right arrow key, we know that the cursor has to move one position to the right if the line of text permits. If we break the way this works, the breakage will be extremely visible once we do any kind of manual test.</p>
<p>But… what happens if the cursor is located in the middle of the last visible line of text, with the viewport scrolled to the right because the line was extremely long, and we press enter to split it? That’s not something you usually do, so what’s the expected behavior there? We need to make sure that, once this works as we intend, it doesn’t unexpectedly break, and we don’t want to have to manually verify this every time we change the editor logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behavior documentation.</strong> The collection of test cases for the TUI will serve us as the documentation of all cases we must care about in the code if we are doing any kind of refactoring, for example. As illustrated above, there are a lot of corner cases to deal with, and unless they are tracked somewhere, it’s too easy to forget about them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency measures.</strong> The last benefit these tests give us is a way to measure efficiency. By capturing the sequence of commands emitted by the TUI logic, we can see if those commands are <em>minimal</em>. Because if they are not, the TUI will flicker.</p>
<p>For example: an easy way to implement the TUI is to refresh the whole screen after every key press—and while that will yield updates that <em>look</em> correct (and that would pass a testing model where we verify screen contents), the app will be doing too much work to update the screen. We need to worry about only doing partial screen updates (clearing a single line, using terminal scrolling features, etc.), and to that end, capturing the sequence of commands lets us do that.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The downside of this testing approach is that, again, we …</p></article></div></div></div>

      <section>
        <p>In my <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/">last post</a> I examined how first principles thinking fails. This post is going to be about a single, concrete example — about an argument that started me down this path in the first place.</p><p>A couple of months ago, a friend sent me a blog post titled <em><a href="https://ensorial.com/2020/dont-raise-money/">Startups Shouldn’t Raise Money</a></em>, over at a website called ensorial.com. I thought that the post was tightly argued and reasonably put together, with each proposition leading logically and coherently to the next. I also noticed that the author had taken the time to construct their argument from first principles … which meant it was difficult to refute any individual clause in their chain of reasoning.</p><p>But I also thought it was wrong. I told my friend as much.</p><p>“How is it wrong?” he immediately challenged.</p><p>“Well …” I began. And then I stopped. I realised I didn’t have a good argument for <em>why</em> it was wrong. Every axiom and intermediate proposition were ideas that I agreed with. And it wasn’t so simple as the conclusion being flat out mistaken — you <em>could</em> probably run a small, successful internet business using the ideas laid out in the posts’s argument (internet-based businesses tend to be simpler to manage, and there are many niches you can occupy).</p><p>But I felt uneasy because I thought the framing wasn’t as <em>useful</em>. This was a more complex thing to debunk.</p><h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2><p>It’s easy to think that arguments have just three terminal truth values: right, maybe, and wrong. In practice, arguments (and in particular, the sort of argument that we use to justify actions) have many possible truth values. These include things like ‘got the details wrong, but is by-and-large correct’, or ‘is correct but for a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-right-level-of-abstraction/">different level of abstraction</a>; doesn’t apply here’, or ‘is partially correct, but isn’t as useful compared to a different framing of things.’ The ensorial.com piece is interesting because I think it is an instance of that last one. It was what pushed me to start thinking about all the various ways first principles thinking could go wrong.</p><p>The author’s argument unfolds as follows:</p><ol><li>Startups are risky.</li><li>Raising capital to do a startup reduces skin in the game (you’re spending other people’s money, after all).</li><li>Once you have less skin in the game, it is easier to make bad decisions. The author argues this is due to a) having a capital buffer to cushion you, and b) having more time to waste.</li><li>The alternative is to forego raising venture capital and to create a sustainable business from the beginning, ‘growing linearly with the number of people that give you money for your product.’</li><li>This aligns incentives: you grow only by solving customer problems that they would pay you for. And you’ll pick the shortest path, because you don’t have the luxury of time given to you by an infusion of other people’s money.</li><li>Therefore: startups shouldn’t raise money.</li></ol><p>At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be anything that’s explicitly <em>wrong</em> with this argument. I agree with all the base ideas, and I found myself nodding to the intermediate propositions. The logical correctness of the argument wasn’t a problem. No, my unease stemmed from experience: I <em>knew</em> this wasn’t the right way to think about raising capital. But I couldn’t begin to construct an argument that went against it.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/argument_chain.f369ba07141442ea959636c21f56e207.png" alt=""></figure><p>My friend and I spent no more than 10 minutes discussing this piece. But in the months after our conversation, I continued to return to the author’s argument. I thought it was interesting because it represented a type of thinking error that you and I are likely to encounter in our lives. The form of the error is subtle, and therefore more difficult to detect; the best description I have for it is: ‘perfectly rational, logically constructed, and not really <em>wrong</em> — but not as useful or as powerful as some other framing.’</p><p>Of course, my obsession was for instrumental reasons: how might you recognise a better framing when you found one? I’ll admit that I was a little naive here: I thought that if I could generalise the structure of this argument, I would be better able to recognise similar errors in the future. Alas, I have not been able to do this to my satisfaction.</p><p>(In practice, most of the older entrepreneurs I know seem to understand the problems with such sensemaking. Plausible arguments are dealt with in a simple manner: you try the recommendations that unfold from the analysis, but you remain alert to see if they give you exactly the results you want. If they don’t, you keep the frame for the time being, but you continue to look out for a better explanation. And how would you know if you have found a better way of thinking about your situation? Simple: you listen carefully. In the words of Malaysian magnate Robert Kuok, “you learn to distill wisdom from the air.”)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The most I’ve been able to do is to articulate <em>how</em> the author messed up — and therefore how first principles thinking may fail — something that I <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/">explored in my previous post</a>. The core idea is simple: I believe the author started from a limited set of axioms. If you start from a wrong set of axioms, you would eventually end up with a flawed conclusion. In this case, I think the ensorial.com author started from a deficient understanding of business.</p><p>To generalise a little, people with limited understanding of business think that business is all about making profits. But those who actually run businesses know that running a business is all about managing cash flows.</p><p>And the ensorial.com author’s argument fails because he doesn’t appear to understand this.</p><h2 id="john-malone-and-the-invention-of-ebitda">John Malone and the Invention of EBITDA</h2><p>In 1972, a 32 year old man named John Malone was offered the top job at Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), a cable company. He took charge on April Fool’s Day, 1973.</p><p>At the time of his hiring, Malone was president of Jerrold Electronics, a division of General Instrument that supplied cable boxes and credit to the cable systems companies. He had been offered the Jerrold Electronics job when he was 29 years old, just two years earlier. Before JE, he was at McKinsey Consulting. And before McKinsey, he had a job at AT&amp;T’s famed Bell Labs, where he applied operations research to find optimal company strategies in monopoly markets. Malone concluded that AT&amp;T should increase its debt load and aggressively reduce its equity base through share repurchases — a highly unorthodox recommendation at the time. His advice was delivered to AT&amp;T’s board and then promptly ignored.</p><p>Malone had been thinking about the interplay between debt, profit, cash flow, and corporate taxes for some time. In 1972, when he was first offered the TCI job, he had already noticed a number of structural properties in the cable industry that piqued his interest:</p><ol><li>The cable industry had highly predictable subscription revenues. Cable television customers in the 60s — especially those in rural communities — were eager to upgrade to cable for better TV reception. These subscribers paid monthly fees and rarely cancelled.</li><li>Cable franchises were essentially a legal right to a local monopoly, which meant that cable system operators had limited competition once it established itself in a given locale.</li><li>The industry itself had very favourable tax characteristics — smart cable operators could shelter their cash flow from taxes by using debt to build new systems, and by aggressively depreciating the costs of construction. Once the depreciation ran out on particular systems, they could then sell them to another operator, where the depreciation clock would start anew.</li><li>Most importantly, the entire market was growing like a weed: over the course of the 60s and into the start of the 70s, subscriber counts had grown over twentyfold.</li></ol><p>Of course, Malone didn’t have much time to reflect on these observations. He landed at TCI and found the company at the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p>Bob Magness, the founder of TCI, had grown the company over the course of two decades using a ridiculous pile of debt — about 17 times revenues, at the time of Malone’s hiring. Malone spent his first couple of years at TCI fighting to keep the company alive. He flew into New York every couple of weeks, hat in hand, renegotiating <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp">covenants</a> and asking for extensions on debt repayments. At one point during a meeting with TCI’s bankers, Malone threw his keys on the table and threatened to walk, leaving the company to the banks. The bankers capitulated, granting TCI a much needed extension.</p><p>Malone and Magness also had to worry about hostile takeovers, given TCI’s low stock price in the early 70s. They executed a series of complicated financial manoeuvres a year or so after Malone took over, placing a large chunk of stock in a holding company to grant them majority control. Later, they created a separate class of voting stock. These moves gave them hard control of the company, allowing Malone the freedom to focus on righting its finances.</p><p>After three years of hell, TCI was finally pulled back from the brink of financial disaster. And then Malone got to work.</p><p>Malone understood a few things about the cable industry that many outsiders didn’t. First, he understood that cable was like real estate: incredibly high fixed costs up front as you built or bought the systems, and then highly predictable, monopoly cash flows for a long time afterwards. He understood that if he used debt to finance acquisitions, he could keep growing the company, and use the depreciation on acquired systems (plus the write-offs from the loans itself) to delay paying taxes on that cash flow. Third, Malone understood that untaxed cash flows from all of those cable subscribers could be used to a) service the debt, b) pay down some of those loans — only when necessary; Malone wanted to keep the debt-to-earnings ratio at a five-to-one level — but more importantly c) demonstrate to creditors that TCI was a worthy debtor. And finally, Malone understood the benefits of size: the larger TCI got, the lower the cost of acquiring programming (i.e. shows and programs), because it could amortise those costs across its entire subscriber …</p></section></div></div>

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">

</video>
<h2 id="loading-the-initial-java-script-bundles">Loading the initial JavaScript bundles</h2>
<p>These are the first two JavaScript bundles the page starts loading.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>routemap</strong> 21 KB (103 KB uncompressed)</li>
<li><strong>core,pm_ng1_bootstrap</strong> 1.3 MB (4.8 MB uncompressed)</li>
</ul>
<p>These files don't take too long to download, but running the code freezes the UI for a while. The spinner SVG becomes stuck at this point, until it's replaced by a skeleton UI for Google Cloud Console page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/gcp-initial-load.png" alt="Filmstrip showing initial rendering of the GCP page"></p>
<p>Here's what happens when the browser wants to run some JavaScript code.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parsing</strong> (done lazily at first, and then as needed later on)</li>
<li><strong>Compilation</strong> (also happens lazily)</li>
<li><strong>Initialization</strong> –&nbsp;the browser runs module initialization code, i.e. code that runs when loading a module rather than when calling one of its functions</li>
<li><strong>Running core app code</strong> – renders the application using the initialized modules</li>
</ol>
<p>For the whole Google Cloud page, just parsing the source code takes 250ms, and compilation takes another 750ms (not including the 113 ms spent on "Compile Script").</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/devtools-profile.png" alt="DevTools profile showing a breakdown of CPU activity"></p>
<p>The initial render of the Angular app takes about 1s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/initial-bundle.png" alt="JavaScript execution flamechart"></p>
<p>Eventually we start to see a new spinner.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/second-spinner.png" alt="Page frame and new spinner"></p>
<h2 id="loading-page-bundles">Loading page bundles</h2>
<p>Once the generic Google Cloud UI is rendered the page starts loading 18 additional JavaScript files with an overall size of 1.5 MB.</p>
<p>Making a lot of separate requests isn't actually a problem though – it can improve performance by increasing the likelinhood of cache hits, and splitting up bundles makes it easy to load only necessary code.</p>
<p>After loading the first set up bundles the app starts making fetch requests and loads 3 more bundles at a total size of 6 MB.</p>
<p>When loading the page on my normal network the requests all kind of blurred together and it was hard to see which requests were sequential. So this screenshot shows the request chart on a throttled connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/more-page-bundles.png" alt="Request waterfall showing three sets of JavaScript being loaded sequentially"></p>
<h2 id="loading-the-list-of-cloud-functions">Loading the list of Cloud Functions</h2>
<p>The request loading the list of Cloud Functions takes about 700ms. But it doesn't start as soon as the bundles are loaded, in part because there's a <code>testIamPermissions</code> request that needs to finish first.</p>
<p>As a result the CPU ends up being idle for half a second –&nbsp;this time could be used better if the request started sooner.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/loading-functions.png" alt="Waterfall showing requests made to load the list of cloud functions"></p>
<p>Finally the app re-renders and we get the list of Cloud Functions we wanted to see.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/cloud-functions.png" alt="Page showing GCP Cloud Functions"></p>

<p>Chrome DevTools has a code coverage tool tracks which parts of the code actually run on the current page. This can help identify code that doesn't have to be loaded.</p>
<p>The Cloud Functions page runs 53% of the JavaScript code it downloads. This is actually a bit disappointing, as it means that even if only necessary code is loaded it would still only cut the total JavaScript size of the page in half.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/code-coverage.png" alt="Chrome DevTools Code Coverage tool"></p>
<h2 id="moving-configuration-into-json">Moving configuration into JSON</h2>
<p>A good amount of the code actually consists of configuration objects. For example, this 200 KB object with 4997 keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/configuration.png" alt="Configuration object in a JavaScript bundle"></p>
<p>Loading this as a JSON string with <code>JSON.parse</code> could be faster, as JSON is simpler to parse than a JavaScript object. This would be easy to do, but might not result in a huge performance improvement.</p>
<p>Ideally the app wouldn't need to load the full list on the client, but this would be harder to implement.</p>
<h2 id="reduce-code-duplication">Reduce code duplication</h2>
<p>The 200KB JSON object above is actually included in two of the JavaScript bundles. Breaking it out and reusing it would save download and processing time.</p>
<p>The same seems to apply to a bunch of UI components, like this one.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/code-duplication.png" alt="Duplicate code in DevTools code search"></p>
<h2 id="prioritize-primary-content">Prioritize primary content</h2>
<p>The Google Cloud page loads a large initial JavaScript bundle. The longer it takes to load and initialize this code, the longer it takes to load page-specific code and to render the list of Cloud Functions the user wants to see.</p>
<p>But the initial bundle also contains secondary content, like the complex navigation sidebar. This menu becomes functional before the main page content is loaded, but it should only be loaded after the primary content.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/prioritize-primary-content.png" alt="Sidebar menu is open while main content is still loading"></p>
<p>Google Cloud already does this in some cases. For example, the page initially renders a simpler version of the header and then loads more complex features later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/header.png" alt="Header doesn't show project dropdown at first and then shows it later"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While the performance of static pages tends to be dominated by render-blocking network requests, single-page apps are often blocked by JavaScript execution or loading account data.</p>
<p>Downloading large amounts of code can hurt performance on slow connections, but due to compression and caching CPU processing often has a greater impact.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/asyncapi-partners-with-postman.png" alt="Post cover image"><p>I'm proud and honored to let you know that we're partnering with <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a><undefined> to boost the development of Asynchronous APIs to a new level <span role="img" aria-label="rocket">🚀</span></undefined></p><p>Since the very beginning, I knew the duty we had at hand was challenging. And still is! The specification was just the trigger of a snowball effect. What's the spec for if you can't do anything with it? Tooling is as important as the specification. However, tooling is a number of times more complex than the specification. We engineers don't want to abandon our favorite programming language and framework, therefore, it's AsyncAPI's responsibility to integrate with the existing tools in the market. <strong>The specification (and tools) should work for the user, not the other way around.</strong> Partnering with Postman allows us to boost the development of more and better tools to help engineers create and maintain Asynchronous APIs while using their favorite programming languages and frameworks.</p><p><strong>Our goal is to make Asynchronous APIs as successful and mature as REST APIs.</strong> We are aware this is a long journey but, with Postman's help, we'll be able to grow the team and continue working on the AsyncAPI specification and all the necessary tools to create a delightful developer experience. The AsyncAPI Initiative team is fully committed to open source software (OSS), and the partnership with Postman will help us keep doing our job with freedom and independence.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>We want to make the AsyncAPI Initiative a neutral and independent place for collaborating on defining the future of Asynchronous APIs. Next step for us is to host the project in a neutral foundation to guarantee the long-term success of the initiative. We're currently in conversations with different actors of the OSS world to make sure the initiative remains independent.</p><p>Also, we want you to work with us. <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/jobs">We are hiring</a> at Postman to work full-time on AsyncAPI. In the first half of 2021, we'll open a bunch of positions, including Software Engineers, Graphic Designers, Technical Writers, and more. Make sure you don't miss them!</p><div><h3>Receive an email when we publish a new job offer:</h3><p>We respect your inbox. No spam, promise ✌️</p></div><p>Before I finish, I would love to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/a85">Abhinav Asthana</a> for being so supportive. And of course, a huge shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/derberq">Łukasz Gornicki</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/e_morcillo">Eva Morcillo</a> for their tireless support. None of these would be possible without their help.</p><p>There's a bright future ahead for Asynchronous APIs. 2021 will be the year of AsyncAPI, the year of you, our beloved open-source community.</p><p><undefined>Cheers! <span role="img" aria-label="clinking beer mugs">🍻</span></undefined></p></article></div>]]>

I’ve written this on the whiteboard next to my standing desk in the home office/guitar studio/mancave/junk room.&nbsp;</p><p>I heard this statement earlier on in the year. Must have been around May or June, it instantly struck a chord with me.</p><p>Working full time and trying to get no less than 3 side hustles and a podcast off the ground is a big ask.&nbsp;</p><p>I have used the progress over perfection mantra before. It was worded slightly differently; I can’t remember the exact statement.</p><p>However, I hadn’t fully embraced the concept.&nbsp;</p><p>When it came to my core skill of software development, I could easily apply this principle.&nbsp;</p><p>Every other part of the side hustle lifestyle was still “I got to make sure this is the best it can be”.</p><h2 id="h-already-integrated-into-my-9-5"><span id="Already_Integrated_into_My_95"></span>Already Integrated into My 9-5<span></span></h2><p>Like I’ve just touched on. I’ve used progress over perfection, day to day with my software development ‘hat’ on.</p><p>I’m going to sound arrogant now. Having spent 14+ years developing software, I’m confident in my skills and the fact I can get stuff done and out the door, quicker than a lot of my “development” peers.</p><p>By using this principle, I can get the feature ‘X’ out to the world. Start feature ‘Y’ and deliver that in rapid time. Same too with Feature ‘Z’</p><p>Then go back to feature ‘X’ and make it better. Progress over perfection in action.</p><h3 id="h-progress-over-perfection-a-real-world-app-example"><span id="Progress_Over_Perfection_%E2%80%93_A_Real_World_App_Example"></span>Progress Over Perfection – A Real World App Example<span></span></h3><p>I’m writing this post towards the end of 2020, having gone through the Coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>At the start of lockdown, I had more spare time and I came up with a <a href="https://baitcamp.net/">mobile app idea for a hobby of mine, fishing</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After doing a bit of product validation and finding out what other fishermen would like to see in the app. I sketched out the features I was going to include in version 1 of the app.</p><p>One of the features was to allow the user to upload photos to the app, linking them to a fishing trip.</p><p>Having never done anything like this before, it was a learning curve, to say the least. I decided to use the “progress over perfection” mantra by making sure the uploading, editing, removing, and retrieving of the photos, from a functionality point of view, was “perfect”</p><p>However, the way the user uploaded the photos and then viewing them was shocking, “perfect” was just a dot on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I went with it as I wanted to get the app published on both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1519992229">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.phhdigital.baitcamp">Google Play</a> as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>5 months after the initial idea came to me, I had published the app on both platforms. WAHOO!</p><p>After feedback from people testing version 1. And the fact I wasn’t happy with the photo upload/viewing features. I have been able to start work on version 1.1 to sort this problem out.</p><p>Another day or two and I will have a slick way of managing the photos. Be able to release an update very quickly. As well as ironing out a few bugs that have come to light.</p><p>I genuinely believe if I had kept on working on the app until I was entirely happy with the photo functionality, I wouldn’t have it published or have people downloading the app and using it.</p><p>The key here was “progress over perfection” to get something live that was usable, then go from there.</p><h2 id="h-side-hustling-and-what-you-need-to-learn"><span id="Side_Hustling_and_What_You_Need_To_Learn"></span>Side Hustling and What You Need To Learn<span></span></h2><p>When it comes to other aspects of side hustling, I’m still “newborn” in a lot of the skills you need.&nbsp;</p><p>Writing blog posts, writing social media posts, copywriting, creating nice-looking webpages, building sales funnels, creating ads, shooting walkthroughs for YouTube, recording video sales letters, editing videos, coming up with offers, researching, scheming and plotting, creating eBooks, creating eBook covers, creating eBook mock-ups, recording podcasts, editing podcasts.</p><p>How did I come up with that list of things to do? I looked at my planner at what tasks I wanted to achieve over the last 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s on top of coding 3 software products by myself. Working 8-4 Monday through Thursday. And, having a life, like spending time with my wife, playing guitar, and going fishing.</p><p>It can be very overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>You see how great other people are at all these other things and want your stuff to be as “perfect” as theirs</p><p>That’s why this new mantra has been a bit of a breakthrough for me.</p><h2 id="h-progress-over-perfection-and-switching-your-mindset"><span id="Progress_Over_Perfection_and_Switching_Your_Mindset"></span>Progress Over Perfection and Switching Your Mindset<span></span></h2><p>As I’ve touched upon. For certain aspects of my day to day I would apply “progress over perfection”. Not all aspects though.</p><p>Hearing this really got me thinking about what I wanted to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing it also did was remove some fear I had around things.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, I had started digging deep into the concept of creating online sales funnels to promote my products and reach my “golden goose” of 350 paying customers.</p><p>My dream is to work for myself running a software product. After a bit of number crunching, I worked out I would need 350 monthly subscribers for me to realize my dream.&nbsp;</p><p>Sales funnels could help me achieve this.</p><h3 id="h-sales-funnel-progress-over-perfection"><span id="Sales_Funnel_Progress_Over_Perfection"></span>Sales Funnel Progress Over Perfection<span></span></h3><p>This is where the fear kicked in. I was worried that I would create a sales funnel, it would completely bomb, and I would feel like a failure.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted my sales funnels to be successful as soon as I start driving traffic to it. If this were a software product, I wouldn’t think like that. I know they will be some bugs and users would probably want something different than what I had built.</p><p>After consuming a lot of content around the sales funnel process and how even the most experienced “funnel hackers” can’t get their funnel to work out of the gate.&nbsp;</p><p>I decided that I just need to get it out there and see what “feedback” I get.</p><p>So, I continued to put it together as best I could, giving myself a time constraint that it must be done by the end of that week. Then the week after I could drive some paid traffic to it.</p><p>I got the opt-in page up and running, where someone could submit their details and in return get a free eBook user guide.</p><p>Next, I spent most of my time working on the sales page and putting together an offer and pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, I added a “One Time Offer” that the person would be shown if they subscribed to the product I was promoting on the sales page.</p><p>Finally, I put together an email sequence that would be sent to anyone who opted in for the free eBook, as a follow up to get them to revisit my funnel.</p><p>The next week I created a Facebook ad campaign and got loads of people into the funnel. Guess how many sales I made?</p><p>ZERO.</p><h3 id="h-analyzing-the-results"><span id="Analyzing_the_Results"></span>Analyzing the Results<span></span></h3><p>Sounds terrible right? It was, but I wasn’t downhearted.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking into the stats, the opt-in page was working. I was getting almost 45% of the visitors to put in their email address and request a copy of the eBook.</p><p>Yes, no one bought from me. I knew that part of my sales funnel did work. However, I was building an email list of people that I could keep in contact with, which I hadn’t be able to do before.</p><p>“Progress over perfection”.</p><p>I ended up scrapping this funnel as I still didn’t ‘convert’ after a few attempts at rewriting parts of the sales page.</p><p>Taking the learnings from the opt-in success, I created a brand-new funnel. This targeted a different group of people. Again, this funnel wasn’t the success I wanted. My opt-in rate was still high, 35% and I got my first ever paying customer.</p><p>Someone signed up and subscribed to <a href="https://outflash.xyz/">my software product called Outflash</a>. They even took my up one-time offer.</p><p>I was blown away. Yes, it wasn’t the riches you pray for, but I had made progress on this skill.</p><p>Progress! Progress towards what I deem successful.</p><h2 id="h-podcasting-and-getting-yourself-out-there"><span id="Podcasting_and_Getting_Yourself_Out_There"></span>Podcasting and Getting Yourself Out There<span></span></h2><p>A problem with being a developer, is you think it will be like the movie Field of Dreams. “Build it and they will come”. With a software product, this NEVER happens.</p><p>Someone said if you want to get yourself out there to promote your products and services. Use a platform or media that you enjoy yourself. For me this was podcasting.</p><p>I’m an avid podcast listener. Whether it be working out, going for a run, listening while coding. I even put a podcast on while cooking a Sunday Dinner.</p><p>Starting a podcast can be scary though. What do I talk about? Do I have enough content to get past the first 10 episodes? How do I even publish a podcast? Which platforms do I publish to?</p><h3 id="h-excuses-excuses-just-do-it"><span id="Excuses,_Excuses,_Just_Do_It"></span>Excuses, Excuses, Just Do It<span></span></h3><p>Having mild success with the sales funnels gave me a lot of belief in the saying “Just Do It”.</p><p>One of the podcasts I listen to is by two guys that have launched their own podcasting hosting and publishing platform. I know, a bit Inception right!</p><p>So, I decided to use their platform to publish and host <a href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/podcast/">my podcast</a>. Which platforms to publish to? Their service had guides on how to publish to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/find-your-side-hustle/id1523991465">Apple</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy50cmFuc2lzdG9yLmZtL2ZpbmQteW91ci1zaWRlLWh1c3RsZQ?sa=X&amp;ved=0CBUQ27cFahcKEwiIrMe2-eLqAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ">Google podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/19pwsqTl75RSGrhhrsFIWW">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/find-your-side-hustle">Stitcher</a>. I didn’t overthink it, I registered with those 4 providers first and thought, “progress over perfection”, I can publish to more platforms later.</p><p>People also think they need a mass of equipment to record and edit a podcast. I was on a roll; nothing was stopping me from getting my first episode out to the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Quickly opening Amazon and searching for “cheap podcast mic”.
