<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Content sites are great, low barrier to entry businesses that (when done right) can generate a sustainable source of cash. </p><p>Not only that, but they’re also fun. Using the method I’m going to outline below, you can pick a topic that really interests you — learn more about it — and make money in the process.</p><p>I started two of my own content sites a few years ago. They were my first foray into internet businesses and affiliate marketing. When I started the first one (about running — Let’s Go Run), I had no idea what I was doing, and no money to do it. </p><p>I scrounged around the internet finding resources about SEO, keyword planning and blogging. I went through about three SemRush trial’s (sorry SemRush!) with different emails trying to come up with a keyword plan, and figure out why the hell my blog posts weren’t coming up on Google! Then, after about 4 months of working on it and putting out content religiously, I started ranking for one of my main keywords. </p><p>I made it to the front page of Google! I’ll never forget the excitement.</p><p>That got me hooked. I spent the next few years growing out that site, and creating another one with my mom (who loves golf). </p><p>I got them to the small-medium level (each had traffic of about 10k monthly visits) and then sold them online. I needed the cash to start what I thought was a ‘real’ business. </p><p>The thing is, I sold them way before I had monetized each of them properly. I just didn’t know what I was doing! And the buyer knew it. All the income was from affiliate earnings, and they were running off the same account (so I don’t have specific figures for each website), earning around about $80 to $100 mark per month combined.</p><p>Knowing what I do now about niche content sites, and their ability to generate a sustainable cash flow, I would have never sold those sites. </p><p>This is my approach to building content sites that are monetized effectively, and how you can too.</p><h2>Background</h2><h3>What Are They?</h3><p>A niche content site is just a website where people wanting to know about something in a certain niche go to find that out.</p><p>If you take any subreddit, and create content specifically tailored to that audience, it would be a niche content site.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52457e66346b8d05835d_0*gL3fHRm-e86x0tgu.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Swim University is the perfect example of a niche site: Everything you need to know about keeping a pool clean.</p><h3>How Do They Work?</h3><p>The fundamentals of it are as follows:</p><ol role="list"><li>Pick a specific niche.</li><li>Create content around that niche, and post it on the website.</li><li>Drive readers to that website.</li><li>Build an audience of readers.</li><li>Monetize that audience.</li></ol><h3>A Modified Approach</h3><p>The approach I’m going to give you here uses the framework above, but modifies the Monetization step slightly.</p><p>The goal is simple: <strong>Get to revenue as fast as possible.</strong></p><p>We’ll go into monetization further below, but the gist of it is this:</p><ul role="list"><li>Traditional niche site model requires a ton of traffic to make decent money (especially today).</li><li>My model requires a few thousand views a month with high intent and in a specific niche.</li></ul><h3>Examples</h3><p><strong>SwimUniversity.com</strong> (above) — Pool care</p><p><strong>GearLab.com</strong> — Outdoor gear reviews</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524647ea4173bd1d6c06_0*d8YHEXfmp62TptgH.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>ApartmentTherapy.com — </strong>Kit out and care for your trendy apartment</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524669ed957a4dbc995f_0*9KPXKzA3bD2Qt04E.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Fatherly.com</strong> — A site for dad’s</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a5245e566339d3104c7a4_0*kZ2EoL3V_m9I3aZ7.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Before you continue, understand your motivation for wanting to do this.</p><p>Here’s mine: <strong>Cash</strong>. Niche sites are great cash generators if you can get them right. As long as you have a steady flow of traffic, they can bring in a (mostly) reliable income every single month.</p><p>For me, that means not having to worry about rent as an expense.</p><p>For you, it might mean an additional income to fund your startup.</p><p>Get clear on your motivation to do this so that when things aren’t going so well, you know whether to knuckle down and commit, or bail out because it’s taking too much time and energy to achieve what you want.</p><p>These aren’t sexy businesses, but they work if you do ’em right.</p><h2>🚵 Pick A Niche</h2><p><strong>And validate it, too.</strong></p><p>This is my unconventional advice: <strong>Start with your interests</strong>.</p><p>The thesis behind that is: If you’re not interested in it, you’re not going to want to create content about it.</p><p>One thing I do know is that for this to be successful you have to commit to creating enough content.</p><p>There are a few things you need to consider when picking a niche, though.</p><h3><strong>Audience size</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>You need a big enough audience to make this viable. <em>Golf</em> = too broad and too competitive. <em>Left-Handed Blind Golfers</em> = too niche. You get the point.</li><li>I would define niche as SwimUniversity.com (above).</li><li>I would define micro-niche as SwimUniversity.com but for glass fibre pools only.</li><li>As a guide — though this is very dependent on your audience and monetization method — your monthly search volume shouldn’t be lower than 30k visits (or 1k visitors a day).</li></ul><h3><strong>Can you monetize it?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>Does this audience typically spend money on this interest? Either directly or indirectly. If yes, then the answer will almost always be continue.</li></ul><p>or…</p><ul role="list"><li>Can you generate a ton of search traffic (100k monthly +), which you’d be able to monetize through Display Ads? This would require large search volume for your search keywords, as well as low domain authority for the competing sites. This is generally only available in completely unexplored niches (of which there are very few around).</li></ul><h3><strong>How does that audience consume most of their content?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>And can you create that content. If your niche consumes mainly blog posts, great. Low barrier. If they mostly consume well produced video content, and you have no experience doing that = bit higher barrier.</li></ul><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Write down all your interests, and then some. Aim for 50 ideas.</li><li>Rank them in order of how ‘niche’ they are. Ie: How many other people are there who share this interest in the world.</li><li>Then rank them in order of your interest in each of them.</li><li>Choose the top 5 combined ranking.</li><li>Sign up for a keyword volume research tool (Most of them offer free trials). I use <a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/#a5dca93d6feebf8609c185b05" target="_blank">Mangools</a>. It’s a lot cheaper (and a bit less powerful) than <a href="https://www.semrush.com/lp/all-in-one-marketing-toolkit/en/?ref=3487429516&amp;refer_source=15-business-ideas-blog-post&amp;utm_source=berush&amp;utm_medium=promo&amp;utm_campaign=link_landing_page:_all-in-one_marketing_toolkit" target="_blank">SEMrush </a>or Ahrefs, but it suits my needs perfectly.</li><li>Do a search for your topic and start collating and creating keywords with monthly search volume &gt; 500 and keyword difficulty &lt; 30. Go after long-tail keywords if you can’t find any.</li><li>If you’re new to this, I haven’t found a better resource than <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/keyword-research/?ref=SimonBlogs" target="_blank">Neil Patel’s guide to keyword research.</a></li><li>When you’re done, you should have a good idea of the amount of monthly traffic you can generate (remember, you’re going to have to rank on the first page for those search terms to get a <em>portion </em>of that traffic!).</li><li>Giving hard and fast rules about traffic volume and keyword difficulty targets is difficult.</li><li>Andrew Boscini put it well to me on Twitter the other day:</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52453067ff4556a6074b_1*hPVtmGrOkuYQX1g7uGPTmQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you going for a ton of traffic that converts in the low % range, or are you going more niche, with very high search intent?</p><p>I’d also recommend snooping around the following forums/places to get a sense for the community you’re diving into and what the pain points are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Reddit </strong>(Find all the applicable sub-reddits)</li><li><strong>Quora </strong>(What questions are people asking)</li><li><strong>Websites</strong>/<strong>Forums </strong>(Who are you competing with)</li><li><strong>Wikipedia </strong>(What information can I give on this niche)</li><li><strong>Twitter </strong>(Do a search and see who the top authorities in the space are)</li><li><strong>Facebook Groups </strong>(How many are they, are they engaged or spammy?)</li></ul><p>As you pick up on areas of discussion, do a search for them as they relate to your niche in the keyword finder and add all those keywords to your list too.</p><h2>✍🏽 Content</h2><p>That’s the fun part done.</p><p>Now that you’ve got your keyword list defined, you need to start writing content. Religiously.</p><p>This is where most people fail on niche sites. They write a few (maybe 5 or 6) articles, and then they get bored and move on. That’s why I said earlier you need to pick a niche that you’re interested in.</p><p>As a guideline, you’re likely going to need to write 100-odd pieces of content in a year.</p><p>If you think that’s unachievable in the niche you’ve selected (because you’ll get bored or otherwise) you have two choices:</p><ol role="list"><li>Go back to the step above and choose a different niche that you’re going to be interested enough in.</li><li>Hire writers (money required).</li></ol><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Once you’ve decided on your niche, start writing. Open a Google Doc and begin on your first piece of content. Aim to put out 2 or 3 pieces for 3 or 4 days back to back.</li><li>You should be going after your most valuable keyword’s (high search, low keyword difficulty) first.</li><li>After 3 or 4 days, you’ll have a good idea for the tone/style of your content and you’ll be better positioned to register a domain and setup a home for your content.</li><li>Try and follow the theme of the example domains I showed above. Preferably including one of the main keywords which describes your niche in the url.</li><li>Don’t get hung up if the ideal .com domain isn’t available. There are other options:</li></ol><ul role="list"><li>Your country’s domain extension (only do this if you’re looking to only attract an audience in your own country)</li><li>.co is a great option</li><li>.io is well recognized in the tech-space</li></ul><p>Your domain name is not the be-all and end-all. A nice one is nice to have, but it’s not essential.</p><p>6. Without a doubt, Wordpress is the best option for a quick and easy setup.</p><p>Your domain/hosting provider will likely have some sort of installer for Wordpress available in the backend (Softaculous, usually) which will do it for you.</p><p>7. Install a theme. I get mine from <a href="https://creativemarket.com/themes/wordpress/blog?u=simonpurdon10" target="_blank">Creative Market.</a></p><p>Again, don’t get hung up on the details. You’ll be surprised by how little people care about the nitty-gritty things that seem to be a big deal to the website-owner.</p><p>If your site works well, looks reasonably good, loads quickly, with great content — that’ll do.</p><p>8. Post your content. Add images. Add external links (more on this later).</p><p>9. Add a method of collecting email addresses! Don’t just have a generic “Join our newsletter” either. No one wants to join just another newsletter.</p><p>Give your readers an actual incentive for signing up: “Join our newsletter for exclusive access to subscriber-only content”.</p><p>10. Remember to install:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank">Yoast SEO plugin</a> (for on-site SEO help)</li><li>Google Analytics</li><li>Facebook Pixel</li></ul><h2>🖱️ Traffic</h2><p>Now for the most important (but also the most tedious, for me) part: <strong>Driving traffic.</strong></p><p>Putting up content and hoping …</p></div></div>

<br></div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The American technology giant
Apple has taken legal action against a small company called Prepear, which is
an application and service that makes it easier for people to plan their meals
and find new recipes. The cause of action: Prepear chose to use a pear-shaped
fruit as its logo, which is too similar to Apple's logo, according to a message
posted on Instagram by the company's founders. The message describes Apple's
action as "a blow to Prepear," and indicates the intention to keep
the original logo and "send a message to large technology companies that
intimidation of small businesses has consequences.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

I know there are a lot of heavy things going on in the world right now, and this is nothing in comparison, but I need your help in a situation that is affecting me, my family, and my coworkers. Please help! Many of you know that I started a business called Prepear almost 5 years ago. It is an app that you can store all your recipes in one place, plan your meals, make grocery lists, and get your groceries delivered all in one place. Recently @apple yes, The trillion dollar Apple, has decided to oppose and go after our small business’ trademark saying our pear logo is too close to their apple logo and supposedly hurts their brand? This is a big blow to us at Prepear. To fight this it will cost tens of thousands of dollars. The CRAZY thing is that Apple has done this to dozens of other other small business fruit logo companies, and many have chosen to abandon their logo, or close doors. While the rest of the world is going out of their way to help small businesses during this pandemic, Apple has chosen to go after our small business. I’m not trying to get anyone to stop using or buying Apple products. I feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple's aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.

<span lang="EN-US">The Prepear company has been in
existence for 5 years. It is an application that allows users to store all
their recipes in one place, plan their meals, make shopping lists and have
their groceries delivered to the same place. The application is a derivative of
Super Healthy Kids, which offers recipes and feeding strategies and shares tips
and organizational tools for parents. The founders say they are facing
litigation from Apple. Apple is said to disagree with the Prepear logo, arguing
that its attributes are too similar to its own logo.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"Apple opposed
the trademark application for our small company, Prepear, requiring us to
change our logo, which is obviously pear-shaped, used to represent our brand in
recipe management and meal planning,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> wrote the founders
of Prepear in a post on Instagram asking for help. Prepear is a small company
with only five employees, and the founders say legal fees have already cost
them "several thousand dollars", plus the dismissal of one team
member, in their legal battle against the iPhone manufacturer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Prepear is asking users to sign to ask Apple to drop its opposition to the
Prepear logo and "help prevent large technology companies from abusing
their position of power by attacking small companies that are already
struggling because of the effects of Covid-19. <o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Prepear also points out that
before "<i>attacking us, Apple opposed dozens of other trademark
applications filed by small companies with fruit-related logos.</i> According
to Prepear, many of these small companies have had to change their logos or
even give up and shut down, as the limited means of most of them did not allow
them to fight the iPhone manufacturer in a lawsuit costing tens of thousands of
dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"It's a very
terrifying experience to be legally attacked by one of the world's largest
companies, even though we clearly haven't done anything wrong, and we
understand why most companies just give in and change their logos</span></i><span lang="EN-US">," the Prepear
founders' message on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard" target="_blank">Change.org</a> says.

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Sending a message
against the bullying of small businesses by the largest technology companies</span></span></b></h2>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear, Apple has
opposed small businesses with fruit-related logos by launching costly lawsuits,
even when these logos do not resemble the Apple logo at all or are not in the
same industry as Apple. <i>"We're defending ourselves against Apple not
only to keep our logo, but also to send a message to large technology companies
that intimidation of small businesses has consequences,"</i> said the
company's founders.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">The iPhone In Canada website says
it received, on Sunday, more details on the trademark application for the
pear-shaped logo of Prepear, a free application available for download on iOS
and Android. In an email sent to the website, chief operating officer Russ
Monson says Prepear has been registering its trademark for the logo since
January 2017 and that the U.S. trademark office finally told it "<i>that
it was not in conflict with other registered trademarks and that it would
publish it for opposition.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Everything seemed to
be coming to an end when, on the</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> "<i>last day of the
opposition period for the trademark, we were informed that Apple had requested
an extension of the opposition period, and then requested further extensions,
which placed our trademark in a legal limbo for a long period of time".<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<div>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear's email,
Apple filed its effective opposition on the last day it was legally entitled to
do so. According to Monson, the additional extensions filed resulted in
additional legal costs for the small company, and to him, these extensions
"seemed to have been designed by their legal team to be as long, difficult
and expensive as possible for us.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Monson goes on to explain that
Prepear was "naive enough" to think that they could discuss the issue
with Apple in a rational manner, as the two logos are different. But this was
not the case and the opposition has now reached the "discovery
phase", which, according to the COO, "will be the most expensive part
of this case for us". However, Prepear decided to move on to this phase at
Apple's request.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"We believe that
this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple's
position on this issue, Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than
let the public see how it is clearly hurting us for no apparent justifiable
reason,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> said Monson in his email to iPhone In Canada.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Other companies have
already changed their logos as a result of Apple's lawsuits.</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Some companies whose logos
(below) were attacked by Apple under the same conditions have given up. But the
founders of Prepear say they are lucky enough to attract enough media attention
"to expose this practice by Apple.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Other logos have also been the
source of legal actions brought by Apple in the past, such as the case against
a Norwegian political party and a German bicycle path. The logo of the
political party in question depicts a red apple with a stem, a green leaf and
has the letter F in white on the front. Apple wrote a letter to the Norwegian

<span lang="EN-US">In 2009, Apple also attacked
Woolworths, an Australian supermarket chain, which had just changed its logo.
Woolworths insisted at the time that its logo is nothing more or less than a
stylized "W", but Apple claimed it was an apple and therefore asked
them to stop using it! Hans Hulsbosch, the creator of the logo, said at the
time that the protection of the Apple logo was "taken to extremes".
"Based on this logic, they should attack all fruit sellers.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Prepear says they are not asking
for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone manufacturer to
"stop attacking small businesses in frivolous affairs that seem designed
to make them spend so much money and time thinking about the business instead
of focusing on how to grow business and ensure to survive the current economic
crisis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The petition on Change.org has
now received 20,000 signatures, and Prepear hopes that Apple will drop the case
before moving on to more costly discovery and trial phases. Otherwise, small
businesses should give up using fruit as a logo for their brand.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

August 9, 2020 | https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My friend Juan Paucar directed me to a paper from the magnificent <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030171834">Programming Languages and Systems
28th European Symposium on Programming, ESOP 2019</a>, related to Codata. I have been very interested in codata, mainly because it relates to data in a category-theory way, but, as usual, I didn't understand many of the words involved. This paper helped me understand a lot, and also helped me understand and shape my mind on how to connect the worlds of FP and OOP. But, before that, we must go on tour over a bit of theory.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Data, better understood as Haskell's <code>data</code> declaration, is nothing more than a type and a bunch of ways (functions) to create values of that type. I'm going to use the GADT syntax just because it makes the functions visible. Here is an example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the folks that don't grasp GADTs yet, the above is equivalent to:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>Foo1</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Foo2</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But with the GADT syntax we can see the functions. <code>Foo1</code> is a constructor, but also a function. <code>Foo1</code> receives an Int and a String, and constructs a value of type <code>Foo</code>. Exactly the same happens with <code>Foo2</code>.</p>
<p>We just talked about constructors: a constructor is nothing more than a function that manufactures a value out of other values. But that pretty much defines every function as a constructor, which isn't helpful. We'll go a bit further: a constructor is a "primitive" function that makes a value of type T, and is not build out of other functions that make a value of type T. Also, a constructor is the function you define when you write a <code>data</code> declaration.</p>
<p>If there are constructors, there should be something that dismantles data, because data seems to be constructed by aggregating values. This thing that deconstructs data is called "eliminators". The universal eliminator in Haskell is the <code>case</code> statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>case</code> statement accepts a parameter (what you put between the <code>case</code> and the <code>of</code>) and returns a value of some type. That's why all the branches in a <code>case</code> statement must have the same type, because when you write a <code>case</code> statement, you are writing a function like <code>mycase :: Foo -&gt; X</code>, but with a nicer syntax.</p>
<p>This means eliminators are not always in the shape of <code>case</code> statements. In reality, eliminators are just functions, and Haskell provides special syntax for these functions to be written in a better way. But, if we go to Lisp, for example, we also have constructors and eliminators.</p>
<p>In Lisp you can manufacture a list with a new head by using the constructor <code>cons</code> (this is why these data structure is called a <code>cons-cell</code>). <code>cons</code> is just another function with two parameters: the head and the tail of the list to be constructed, and returns the list. To destructure a cons-list, you have two eliminators: <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. <code>car</code> takes a list and returns the head, <code>cdr</code> takes the list and returns the tail.</p>
<p>Haskell also offers eliminators, but everyone frowns at you if you use them too much: when you declare a record datatype, Haskell helpfully creates functions to access each of the fields:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>=</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fooField1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>fooField2</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>}</span>




</code></pre></div>
<p>Everyone frowns at you when you use these accessors because if <code>FooRecord</code> has more than a single constructor, and you use an eliminator for the other constructor, your program blows up in flames. This is no different to how <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> blow up in flames when you pass as parameter an empty list.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is that <code>data</code> is a declaration that offers a bunch of different ways to create a value, and your program chooses which one interests you for the current case.</p>
<h2>Category Theory</h2>
<p>Category Theory is a branch of Mathematics mainly used by haskellers to annoy everyone else. But, believe it or not, it's also useful to reason about programs. In Category Theory we have objects and we have arrows that interconnect the objects. For something to be a Category, its objects and arrows have to obey some rules.</p>
<p>One of the constructs of Category Theory is the co-category. A co-category is a category where the arrows have been reversed. If in category X, an arrow goes from A to B, in the category co-X, the arrow goes from B to A.</p>
<p>At this point, "codata" should be suspicious to you. It totally looks like "co-data", the co-category of "data". But, how does it actually look the category of "data"?</p>
<h3>The Category of data</h3>
<p>The "data" category is revealed to us as the <code>data</code> declaration. Let's have another look at the <code>Foo</code> example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case (but not in all categories) the types are the objects and the functions are the arrows. If we massage a little bit the code above, by using uncurrying, we can get to a data format that is a bit less arrow-ish and easier for our purposes:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now <code>Foo1</code> takes a pair of Int and String and returns a <code>Foo</code>, and <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Bool</code> and returns a <code>Foo</code>. This is pretty much what every haskeller already knows: you don't have a <code>Foo</code> via <code>Foo1</code> until you provide both the <code>Int</code> and the <code>String</code>, no matter how many arrows are in the middle.</p>
<p>And now, the case statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's massage it a little bit to turn it into a function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>fooEliminator</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Foo</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>fooEliminator</span> <span>(</span><span>myfoo</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have converted <code>case</code> into a plain old function, we don't need to do hand-waiving and magic because everything is now plain old function composition and application. Also, all the uncurrying that all the haskellers are about to complain is just going to help us.</p>
<h3>The co-Category of data: co-data</h3>
<p>I massaged all these expressions and uncurried them because, otherwise it is confusing. I mean, a co-category is a category with the arrows flipped. Which poses the question: which arrows? All of them? Some of them? Everything is easier if there is a single arrow: it means we don't have to go figuring out which one.</p>
<p>So let's flip the arrow of the <code>Foo</code> data declaration, and let's see what comes out.</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>
<span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I happily renamed <code>data</code> to <code>codata</code>, and flipped the single arrow in each line. Let's massage it a little bit more by flipping the order of the arguments so that the arrow points to the right, because we are accustomed to see the arrow functions that way:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What does this mean? Well, a lot of things at the same time, but let's go one by one.</p>
<p>We have two functions related to the <code>codata Foo</code>. The first, called <code>Foo1</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a pair of Int and String. The second, called <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a <code>Bool</code>. We have two functions that take what seems to be a composite value <code>Foo</code> and extract simple values from it of types <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code> and <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>The same way that we could call any of the two functions in the <code>data Foo</code> declaration, we can call any of the two functions in the <code>codata Foo</code>, and get an <code>(Int, String)</code> for the first case, and a <code>Bool</code> for the second. Nothing forces us to call both, and we can just call any one of them.</p>
<p>If we have a <code>Foo</code>, and by calling <code>Foo1</code> we get simple values from it, this looks a lot like a eliminator. But we can also call <code>Foo2</code>, which looks like another eliminator.</p>
<p>Trying to make sense of all of this, we reach a deep insight:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data</code> is about how we can call any of the many different constructors of a composite value.</li>
<li><code>codata</code> is about how we can call any of the many different eliminators of a composite value.</li>
</ul>
<p>From it, we can derive further insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codata looks a lot like objects and methods, where the codata value is the object, and the eliminators are the methods. There is probably some theorem out there that maps codata as a category to objects in OO programs.</li>
<li>It's not that Functional Programming is superior to Object Oriented Programming. But, the usual Functional Programmer has been an Object Oriented Programmer before. Because of this, he is likely to know <code>codata</code> from OO, and now is starting to understand <code>data</code> from FP. As a result of this, he is better armed than an Object Oriented Programmer because an Object Oriented Programmer only knows <code>codata</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further philosophical details can be extracted from the duality data-codata:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we were to find a pure FP programmer, and a pure OO programmer, they would probably have a similar level of skill, but in totally different dimensions. This would make very hard to actually figure out who is the most skilled, because their skill-sets wouldn't be comparable! How do you compare skill-set in <code>data</code> with skill-set in <code>codata</code>?</li>
<li>Data (and Functional Programming) deals on how we can construct complex datatypes from simple ones by using constructors. Codata (and Object Oriented Programming) deals on how we can extract the components from an object by calling its methods.</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem">Expression Problem</a> states that you should be able to add new cases and new functions to a datatype without losing type safety and without having to recompile.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an OO language, you can add a new case by creating another subclass and implementing the methods. But, if you want to add a new function to a datatype, you have to add it to the superclass and implement it on all the existing subclasses, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
<li>In a FP language you can add a new function to an existing datatype just by adding a function. But, if you want to add a new case, you have to add the constructor and modify all the functions that use the datatype, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turns out, with our new data-codata knowledge, that we have a deeper insight into the Expression Problem, and …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<p>Developing enterprise-grade web apps from scratch using open-source front-end and backend frameworks takes a long time. Nowadays, customers are looking for quick and cost-effective solutions and are gravitating towards using no-code and low-code app development platforms. How can full-stack developers thrive in this new world of no-code and low-code platforms?</p>



<h2><strong>No-code and Low-code Platforms</strong></h2>



<p>One purpose of these platforms is to increase the pool of available web app developers by tapping into the broader workforce of non-technical and semi-technical employees. Vendors have developed no-code platforms to be used by non-technical employees to build simple applications, and low-code platforms to be used by employees with basic technical skills (ex: SQL, JavaScript) to develop more complex enterprise applications. Secondly, these platforms can reduce web app development time by over 50% compared to the traditional web app development method.</p>



<p>Currently, there are a large number of vendors competing in the no-code and low-code market segments. No-code platform vendors include AppSheet (Google), Betty Blocks, QuickBase, Airtable, Bubble, and Microsoft PowerApps. Low-code platform vendors include Microsoft PowerApps, OutSystems, Mendix, Salesforce Lightning Platform, Nintex, Appian, and Pegasystems.</p>



<p>We won’t discuss no-code platforms because they cater to non-technical employees and are used for developing simple apps. It’s unlikely that you, as a web developer, will be asked to work on the no-code platform to build web apps.</p>



<p>Low-code platforms, on the other hand, are used to develop more complex apps. Working on developing a web app using these low-code platforms has several disadvantages for a professional web developer who is used to developing apps using open technologies such as front-end and back-end frameworks. Here is a<a href="https://medium.com/@michaelhenderson/why-outsystems-ruined-my-dev-job-3119828fd051"> blog post</a> from a professional web developer about his experiences working on one of these low-code platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Problem-1</strong>: No control over source code</p>



<p>Low-code platforms provide a visual metaphor to develop web apps. Even the app’s business logic is implemented by dragging and dropping code control statements such as if/then/else. Therefore, developers working on these platforms have little control over source code. Not having control over source code creates at least two issues: (a) It’s challenging to develop domain-driven apps with complex business logic, (b) debugging problems can be very difficult and frustrating.</p>



<p><strong>Problem-2</strong>: Career Limiting</p>



<p>Working full-time on a low-code platform can be career-limiting for professional web developers. They would lose their current technical skills in open programming languages and frameworks and gain skills in a proprietary low-code platform. Suppose this proprietary low-code platform is not widely adopted across employers, which is currently the case for any specific low-code platform. In that case, the developer’s low-code platform skills can only be used at another employer who has also adopted the same low-code platform. This severely limits the career mobility of the developer.</p>



<p>Is there a better option? Yes. Why not build a low-code platform for professional web app developers that satisfies both the employers’ need for speed and developers’ needs for control and career mobility? How do we achieve this? Read on …</p>



<h2><strong>Automate Boilerplate Code Generation</strong></h2>



<p>When developing web applications, there is quite a bit of cut/paste/modify work.</p>



<p>Most of the applications I have developed have used an N-layered architecture. In this architecture, to provide a ReST API for the CRUD operations on a database table (entity), we need to develop code for the entity, the DAO (Data Access Object) layer, the services layer, and the ReST controller layer. Similarly, to create UI screens to allow end-users to perform CRUD operations, we need to develop UI components and a front-end services layer that interacts with the back-end ReST API. Once this work is completed for a single database table (entity), similar work must be repeated for each table of the database schema. Imagine having to do this for 50 database tables – this is tedious and error-prone work.</p>



<p>A better approach would be to automate the generation of boilerplate code. To automate, we can develop an application generator that reads the database schema and generates the back-end and front-end code to allow end-users to perform CRUD operations on database tables (entities).</p>



<h2><strong>Provide Add-ons for Functional Cross-cutting Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>Over time, I have noticed that web applications have many functional cross-cutting concerns that repeat across applications. Examples of functional cross-cutting concerns include Authentication &amp; Authorization, Document management, Transactional Emails, Jobs Scheduler, User Registration, and Embedded Reporting. Almost every web application I have been involved in developing required each of these capabilities. In each case, my development team reinvented the wheel and built these cross-cutting concerns from scratch because we never thought about building generic and customizable functional cross-cutting concerns that can be used across web apps- what a waste of effort &amp; time!</p>



<p>If the base code for such functional cross-cutting concerns was already built and available, we could have re-used it and customized it as needed for each web application.</p>



<h2><strong>Provide Visual Development Tools</strong></h2>



<p>Developing enterprise applications involves developing custom functionality such as designing a database schema or domain model, building custom screens for non-CRUD operations, building enterprise-specific themes (colors, fonts), and developing integrations with external systems.</p>



<p>Professional development teams can further reduce the application development time &amp; cost by using visual development tools that accelerate the development of these custom functionality artifacts.</p>



<h2><strong>Support Development Team’s Preferred Stack</strong></h2>



<p>When developing enterprise applications, professional development teams have specific preferences over open technologies used, such as front-end and back-end frameworks, Object-relational mapping tools, UI Component frameworks, and dependency management systems. Specific technologies are preferred by teams either because they are the enterprise architecture standard or because most team members have experience using these technologies.</p>



<p>By supporting the specific technologies chosen by development teams, open low-code platforms for professional developers can help and not reduce the acceleration of application development.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The approach mentioned above allows development teams to reduce the time to develop a web app by over 50%, similar to proprietary low-code platforms. Additionally, developers have full control over the source code, eliminating their inability to develop domain-driven apps with complex business logic and easily debug issues. Finally, developers use open technologies when developing web apps, eliminating the problem of limited career mobility.</p>



<p>In summary, a low-code platform built for professional web app developers eliminates the disadvantages of proprietary low-code platforms while preserving their advantage of rapid app development.</p>

<p>The images posted on Facebook, <a href="https://monetize.info/telegram-bots/">Telegram groups</a> and Twitter by independent journalists in Belarus show huge crowds of people in Minsk, but also in other cities of the country – Gomel, Brest or Baranovichi. In the latter two reportedly, police withdrew from the central area in front of thousands of protesters.</p>

<p>On the same evening, according to exit polls, <strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko</strong> would have won the election again by 79.7%, while opposition candidate <strong>Svetlana Tihanovskaia</strong> would have won only 6.8% of the suffrages.</p>
<p>The country’s authoritarian leader has previously said that everything will remain “under control”. However, independent journalists in Belarus say that citizens are angry and convinced that the elections have been rigged.</p>
<p>Opposition candidate Svetlana Tihanovskaia’s spokeswoman claimed her victory based on “real” results from 20 polling stations. The official asked the Central Election Commission to declare the correct results on Monday. Tihanovskaia herself urged police not to forget “that it is part of the nation.” “I know that citizens will wake up tomorrow in a new country and I hope that tomorrow will bring good news. Stop the violence. officers, I know you can do it,” the opposition candidate said. Several polling station presidents came out in front of citizens to announce what they call the “real” results of the vote. In the clip below, Tihanovskaia is announced winning by 90%.</p>

<p><strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko is in his sixth term as president of Soviet-state Belarus and has ruled the country since 1994.</strong> He is in office for the longest time of all European heads of state (except monarchs). In Belarusian society, the “Old Man” is unofficially called.</p>

		<p>tl;dr: Use advanced Google Search to find any webpage, emails, info, or secrets</p>
<p>cost: $0</p>
<p>time: 2 minutes</p>

<p>Software engineers have long joked about how much of their job is <a href="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/">simply Googling things</a>.</p>
<p>Now you can do the same, but for free.</p>
<p>Below, I'll cover <code>dorking</code>, the use of search engines to find very specific data:</p>
<p>For each example, you can paste it directly into Google to see the result.</p>
<h2>table of contents:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#webpages">webpages</a></li>
<li><a href="#emails">emails</a></li>
<li><a href="#files">files</a></li>
<li><a href="#seo">SEO</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="webpages">webpages</h3>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/Contextify1/status/1255202725551202304">this Twitter exchange</a> with Gumroad CEO Sahil Lavingia, the next few examples will cover Gumroad and Sahil.</p>
<p>find specific pages within a website (ex: for DynamoDB e-books)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:gumroad.com dynamodb
</pre></div>


<p>find specific pages that must include a phrase in the Title text</p>
<div><pre><span></span>allintitle:"support this" site:gumroad.com
</pre></div>


<p>find similar sites (Google only)</p>



<p>you can chain operators together (ex: looking for bug bounties with either security or bug-bounty in the URL)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>(inurl:security OR inurl:bug-bounty OR site:hackerone.com) + "gumroad"
</pre></div>


<p>you can restrict to certain top-level domains (ex: lists of teachers)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:.edu filetype:xls inurl:"email.xls"
</pre></div>



<h3 id="emails">emails</h3>

<p>find Gmail accounts</p>
<div><pre><span></span>sahil lavingia "@gmail.com"
</pre></div>


<p>find work accounts (you'll need to find their domain first)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>sahil lavingia "@gumroad.com"
</pre></div>


<p>not finding what you're looking for with either of those? Try to guess the  format of the email (try going to <a href="https://www.email-format.com/d/shopify.com/#">this site</a>, search the domain, and click <code>Identified Name Formats</code>))</p>



<p>you can always find every page with emails on it (and then use the next snippet below)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:gumroad.com intext:"@gumroad.com"
</pre></div>


<p>find every email on a web page that you're on. The big kahuna - this works for every website. Inject it into a site with Chrome DevTools (<a href="https://www.alec.fyi/how-to-scrape.html">more here</a>)</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>elems</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>getElementsByTagName</span><span>(</span><span>"*"</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>re</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span><span>(</span><span>"(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>elems</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>re</span><span>.</span><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>elems</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>innerHTML</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>elems</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>innerHTML</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>this will log every email found, without you having to scan through the whole page.</p>

<h3 id="files">files</h3>

<p>find spreadsheets</p>
<div><pre><span></span>filetype:csv OR filetype:xlsx OR filetype:xls OR filetype:xltx OR filetype:xlt OR inurl:airtable.com/universe/
</pre></div>


<p>find Google Docs and Google Sheets</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:docs.google.com "gumroad"
</pre></div>


<p>find where your competitor's logo is (ex: partners or customers' websites)</p>



<p>find your competitors' sales pitches and whitepapers</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:intercom.com (filetype:pdf OR filetype:ppt)
</pre></div>


<p>find case studies written about competitors</p>
<div><pre><span></span>inurl:hubspot-case-study -site:http://hubspot.com
</pre></div>



<h3 id="seo">SEO</h3>

<p>find sites with specific keywords in the anchor text</p>
<div><pre><span></span>inanchor:"cyber security"
</pre></div>


<p>research blog posts with specific keywords in their title</p>



<p>find backlinks (ex: other sites that link to a particular blog post). note: the <code>link</code> operator is now deprecated</p>
<div><pre><span></span>intext:intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference
</pre></div>


<p>find keyword permutations with the <code>wildcard</code> operator</p>



<p>find companies using a given widget</p>
<div><pre><span></span>intext:"Powered by Intercom" -site:intercom.com
</pre></div>



<h3 id="coupons">coupons!</h3>

<p>search the site itself for codes</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:curology.com ("coupon" | "referral code" | "affiliate code" | "discount code" | "VIP")
</pre></div>


<p>next, try twitter</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:twitter.com + "meundies" + ("coupon" | "referral code" | "affiliate code" | "discount code" | "VIP")
</pre></div>


<p>next, try Mailchimp emails</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:campaign-archive.com + "blueapron" + ("coupon" | "referral code" | "affiliate code" | "discount code" | "VIP")
</pre></div>



<h3 id="secrets">secrets</h3>

<p>cybersecurity experts use dorking, as one tool among many, to find potential vulnerabilities in a company. I will not be covering any such queries, out of concern for their potential for misuse.</p>

<h3 id="review">operator review</h3>

<p><code>operators</code> are components of a search query that narrow the results down. You can combine as many as you want in one query. The most useful ones you'll want to know are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>operator</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>"phrase"</td>
<td>results must include "phrase"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-phrase</td>
<td>exclude results with phrase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>phrase1 AND phrase2 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>phrase1 and phrase2 must both be included</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>phrase1 OR phrase2</td>
<td>one of phrase1 and phrase2 must be included (or both)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>site:example.com</td>
<td>results must be on domain example.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>filetype:jpg</td>
<td>results must be of type <code>.jpg</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>AND/OR logic can be used to combine distinct queries</p>
<div><pre><span></span>"phrase1" OR "phrase 2" AND "phrase3"
# equivalent to these two searches
&gt;&gt; "phrase1"
&gt;&gt; "phrase 2" AND "phrase3"
</pre></div>

They found that cepafungin I bound to not one but two places on the proteasome, enacting a powerful result. Their report appears in the journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-chemical-biology%2Ffulltext%2FS2451-9456%2820%2930285-3%3F_returnURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%252Fretrieve%252Fpii%252FS2451945620302853%253Fshowall%253Dtrue&amp;t=NTQ2NDZjNDlmMGJlOGI2MjZkMmE5NTlhM2IyN2QzMGZkMTBlNzYzNSxSOHk5NUxheg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625997758414929920%2Fsynthesizing-cepafungin&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597235086"><i>Cell Chemical Biology</i></a>.</p><p>“Because cepafungin I is able to engage the proteasome in two ways, it allows for amplification of its effect,” Renata says. “We showed that this compound elicits many similar downstream biological responses as the FDA-approved chemotherapy bortezomib, while also having certain qualities that may translate into fewer unwanted side effects for patients.”</p><h2><b>Recreating nature</b></h2><p>Cepafungin I first intrigued researchers because of its usefulness as an antifungal substance, and later as a promising anti-cancer agent. It kills cells by acting on the proteasome, which is responsible for clearing away the “garbage” produced by cells. When the proteasome’s function is blocked, cells are overcome with their waste and die.</p><p>But making enough of the compound to be able to study its activity or enable its eventual use a medication has proven challenging, due largely to its complex molecular structure. In the field of chemistry, scientists seek to create the desired structure in as few steps as possible, which leads to cost and time savings. But with complex compounds, that isn’t an easy task. &nbsp;</p><p>The Scripps Research team was able to overcome these challenges and synthesize the compound in just nine steps.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Everyone knows how to track which processes run on Linux, but almost no-one tracks them accurately. In fact, <strong>all</strong> of the methods listed in this post have some deficiency or another. Lets define requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>All processes should be logged including short-lived processes</li>
<li>We should know the full executable path of every process that runs</li>
<li>Within reason, we shouldn’t need to modify or recompile our code for different kernel versions</li>
<li>Bonus: If the host is a Kubernetes node or runs docker than we should be able to determine which pod/container a process belongs to. To do so, it is often sufficient to know a process’ cgroup ID. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Lets looks at common Linux APIs that can solve this problem. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on detecting <code>execve</code> syscalls. A full solution will also need to monitor <code>fork</code>/<code>clone</code> syscalls and their variants as well <code>execveat</code>.</p>

<h3 id="simple-usermode-solutions">Simple Usermode Solutions</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Poll <code>/proc</code></strong>. This is no good because it will miss short-lived processes.</li>
<li><strong>Use the netlink process connector</strong>. The connector will deliver notifications for short-lived processes but the notifications only include numerical data like the process’ <code>pid</code> without data like the executable path. Therefore, you’re back to reading data from <code>/proc</code> and have the same race condition for short-lived processes.</li>
<li><strong>Use the Linux audit API.</strong> This is the best solution out there. The audit API exists in all modern kernels, provides full executable paths, and won’t miss short-lived processes. There are only two disadvantages. First of all, only one usermode program can communicate with the kernel audit API at a time. This is a pain if you are developing an enterprise security solution and have customers who use the audit API themselves via <code>auditd</code> or <code>osquery</code>.<sup id="fnref:audit"><a href="#fn:audit">2</a></sup> Second of all, the audit API isn’t container aware, despite years of kernel mailing list discussions on fixing the issue.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="simple-kernel-debugging-solutions">Simple Kernel Debugging Solutions</h3>

<p>These solutions all involve a single kernel probe of various types.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use tracepoints<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> .</strong> The kernel contains several relevant tracepoints which execute at different points in the <code>execve</code> syscall. They are: <em>sched_process_exec</em>, <em>open_exec</em>, <em>sys_enter_execve</em>, <em>sys_exit_execve</em>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup> These tracepoints are better than the previous solutions because they will track short-lived processes, but none of these tracepoints provide an executable’s full path when the parameter to <code>exec</code> is a relative path. In other words, if the user runs <code>cd /bin &amp;&amp; ./ls</code> then the path will be reported as <code>./ls</code> and not <code>/bin/ls</code>. Here is a simple demonstration:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code># enable the sched_process_exec tracepoint
sudo -s
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
echo 1 &gt; events/sched/sched_process_exec/enable

# run ls via a relative path
cd /bin &amp;&amp; ./ls

# fetch data from the sched_process_exec tracepoint
# note that we don't see the full path
cd -
cat trace | grep ls

# disable the tracepoint
echo 0 &gt; events/sched/sched_process_exec/enable
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use kprobes/kretprobes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">5</a></sup>.</strong> Unlike tracepoints, there are many, many possible functions where you can insert a kprobe which will be hit during an <code>execve</code> syscall. However, I can’t find a single function in <code>execve</code>’s callgraph which has as function parameters both the process’ PID and the full path of the executable. Therefore we have the same issue with relative paths as the tracepoint solution. There are some clever hacks you can do here - after all, kprobes can read data from the kernel’s callstack - but these solutions wont be stable across kernel versions so I’m ruling them out.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Use eBPF programs with tracepoints/kprobes/kretprobes</strong><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">6</a></sup>. This opens up some new options. Now we can run arbitrary code in the kernel every time that the <code>execve</code> syscall runs. In theory, this should let us extract any information we want from kernel and send it to usermode. There are two ways of obtaining such data and neither meets our requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read data from kernel structs like <code>task_struct</code> or <code>linux_binprm</code>. We can indeed fetch the executable’s full path this way<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">7</a></sup> but reading from kernel structs will make us dependent on kernel versions. Our eBPF program needs to know the offsets of struct members so it has to be compiled with kernel headers for each kernel version. This is typically solved by compiling the eBPF program at runtime, but that brings it’s own issues like a requirement that you have kernel headers available on every machine.</li>
<li>Use eBPF helper functions to fetch data from the kernel. This is compatible across all kernel versions that contain the helper you use. In this method you never access kernel structs directly - rather you use helper APIs to fetch data. There is only one problem: there is no eBPF helper function which can obtain the executable’s full path. (However, in recent kernel versions, there <em>is</em> an eBPF helper function to get the cgroup ID which is useful for mapping processes to containers.)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hackish-solutions">Hackish Solutions:</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on every running executable and hook <code>exec</code> calls in libc</strong>. Seriously, don’t do this. It won’t work for statically compiled executables, is easy for malicious code to bypass, and is fairly intrusive.</li>
<li><strong>Use tracepoints on <code>execve</code>, <code>fork</code>/<code>clone</code>, and <code>chdir</code> to track not only the creation of all processes but also their current working directory.</strong> For each <code>execve</code> lookup the process’ working directory and combine that with <code>execve</code>’s parameter to obtain a full path. If you do this, make sure you use eBPF maps and put all the logic into your eBPF programs to avoid race conditions where events arrive in usermode in the wrong order.</li>
<li><strong>Use ptrace based solutions</strong>. These are too intrusive for production code. However, if you do go this route then  use ptrace + seccomp and the <code>SECCOMP_RET_TRACE</code> flag. Then seccomp can intercept all <code>execve</code> syscalls in the kernel and pass them to a usermode debugger which can log the <code>execve</code> call before telling seccomp to continue with the <code>execve</code> as usual.</li>
<li><strong>Use AppArmor.</strong> You can write an AppArmor profile which forbids a process from executing any other executables. If you put that profile in complain mode then AppArmor wont actually prevent process execution - it will only issue alerts when the profile is violated. If we attach our profile to every running process then we will have a working but very ugly and hackish solution. You probably shouldn’t do this.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="3rd-party-tools">3rd Party Tools</h3>

<p>None of these solutions satisfy our requirements, but here they are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use <code>ps</code></strong> - this just polls from <code>/proc</code> and therefore has the usual race conditions</li>
<li><strong>Use the eBPF-based <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/execsnoop.py">execsnoop</a></strong> - this is just a kprobe/kretprobe based solution so it has the same dependency on kernel versions discussed above. Besides, execsnoop doesn’t even expand relative paths so we have gained nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Use the old non-eBPF version of execsnoop</strong> - this won’t work either. It is just a simple kprobe.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="future-solutions">Future Solutions:</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use the eBPF helper function <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/patch/7464919bd9c15f2496ca29dceb6a4048b3199774.1576629200.git.ethercflow@gmail.com/">get_fd_path</a></strong> - this doesn’t yet exist, but once it is added to the kernel it will somewhat help. You’ll still have to get the executable’s FD in a way that doesn’t involve reading from kernel structs.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h3>

<p>None of the APIs covered here are perfect. Here are my recommendations for which solution you should use and when:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you can, use the audit API via <code>auditd</code> or <a href="https://github.com/slackhq/go-audit">go-audit</a>. This will log all processes, including short-lived processes, and you’ll get full executable paths without any effort. This solution wont work if someone is already using the audit API via a different usermode tool than you. In that case, read on.</li>
<li>If you don’t care about full-paths and you want a quick, ready-made solution that doesn’t involve writing any code then use <code>execsnoop</code>. This has the disadvantage of requiring kernel headers at runtime.</li>
<li>If you don’t care about full-paths and you’re willing to go the extra mile to avoid requiring kernel headers then use one of the tracepoints mentioned above. There are multiple ways that you can connect to those tracepoints and transfer their data to usermode - whether it is via the filesystem interface shown above, via an eBPF program with eBPF maps, or via <code>perf</code> tools. I’ll cover these options in another post. The main thing to remember is this: if you use an eBPF program make sure it can be statically compiled so that you don’t have the same dependency on kernel headers that you’re trying to avoid. This means you can’t access kernel structs and you can’t use frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">BCC</a> which compile eBPF programs at runtime.</li>
<li>If you don’t care about short-lived processes and the previous solutions don’t fit your use-case then use the netlink process connector in conjunction with <code>/proc</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Have I forgotten an obvious solution? Message me! I haven’t yet setup a commenting system on this website, but you can message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natanyellin/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Despite using a FTTH internet connection since 2014, aside from the one fiber
uplink, I had always used network gear with 1 Gbit/s links over regular old rj45
cat5(e) cables.</p>

<hr>

<p>I liked the simplicity and uniformity of that setup, but decided it’s time to
add at least one fiber connection, to <strong>get rid of a temporary ethernet cable</strong>
that connected my kitchen with the rest of my network that is largely in the
living room and office.</p>

<p>The temporary ethernet cable was an experiment to verify that running a server
or two in my kitchen actually works (it does!). I used a <a href="https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/hama-cat-6-flach-we-1000cm-netzwerkkabel-7465292">flat ethernet
cable</a>,
which is great for test setups like that, as you can often tape it onto the
walls and still close the doors.</p>

<p>So, we will replace one ethernet cable with one fiber cable and converters at
each end:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="216" alt="0.9mm thin fiber cables"></a></p>

<p>Why is it good to switch from copper ethernet cables to fiber in this case?
Fiber cables are <strong>smaller and hence easier to fit</strong> into existing cable
ducts. While regular ethernet cable is way too thick to fit into any of the
existing ducts in my flat, I was hoping that fiber might fit!</p>

<p>When I actually received the cables, I was surprised <strong>how much thinner</strong> fiber
cables actually can be: there are 0.9mm cables, which are so thin, they can be
hidden in plain sight! I had only ever seen 2mm fiber cables before, and the
0.9mm cables are incredibly light, flexible and thin! Even pasta is typically
thicker:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.thumb.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="0.9mm thin fiber cables"></a></p>

<p><small><em>Preparing a delicious pot of glass noodles ;)</em></small></p>

<hr>

<p>The cable shown above comes from <a href="https://www.fs.com/company/about_us.html">the fiber store
FS.COM</a>, which different people have
praised on multiple occasions, so naturally I was curious to give them a shot
myself.</p>

<p>Also, for the longest time, it was my understanding that fiber connectors can
only be put onto fiber cables using expensive (≫2000 CHF) machines. A while ago
I heard about <strong>field assembly connectors</strong> so I wanted to verify that those
indeed work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Aside from practical reasons, playing around with fiber networking also makes
for a good hobby during a pandemic :)</p>

<h2 id="hardware-selection">Hardware Selection</h2>

<p>I ordered all my fiber equipment at <a href="https://www.fs.com/">FS.COM</a>: everything
they have is very affordable, and products in stock at their German warehouse

week.</p>

<p>If you are in the luxurious position to have enough physical space and agility
to pull through an entire fiber cable, <strong>without having to remove any
connectors</strong>, you can make a new network connection with just a few parts:</p>

<p>I recommend buying an extra fiber cable or two so that you can accidentally
damage a cable and still have enough spares.</p>

<p>Total cost thus far: just under 100 CHF. If you have existing switches with a
free SFP slot, you can use those instead of the media converters and save most
of the cost.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you need to <strong>temporarily remove</strong> one or both of the fiber cable connector(s),
you also need field assembly connectors and a few tools in addition:</p>

<p>I recommend buying twice the number of field assembly connectors, for practicing.</p>

<p>Personally, I screwed up two connectors before figuring out <a href="#field-assembly-connectors">how the process
goes</a>.</p>

<p>Total cost: about 160 CHF for the field assembly equipment, so 260 CHF in total.</p>

<p>With the visual fault locator, you can shine a light through your fiber. You can
verify correct connector assembly by looking at how the light comes out of the
connector.</p>

<p>The fiber cleaning swabs are good to have in general, but for the field assembly
connector, you need to use alcohol-soaked wipes anyway (which FS.COM does not
stock).</p>

<p>The total cost for everything is just under 300 CHF.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-selection-process">Hardware Selection Process</h3>

<p>The large selection at FS.COM can be overwhelming to navigate at first. My
selection process went something like this:</p>

<p>My first constraint is using bi-directional (BiDi) fiber optics modules so that
I only need to lay a single fiber cable, as opposed to two fiber cables.</p>

<p>The second constraint is to use field assembly connectors.</p>

<p>If possible, I wanted to use <a href="https://community.fs.com/blog/why-not-use-bend-insensitive-fiber-optic-cable-to-reduce-bend-radius.html">bend-insensitive
fiber</a>
so that I wouldn’t need to pay so much attention to the bend radius and have
more flexibility in where and how I can lay fiber.</p>

<p>With these constraints, there aren’t too many products left to combine. An
obvious and good choice are 0.9mm fiber cable using LC/UPC connectors.</p>

<h3 id="fs-com-details">FS.COM details</h3>

<p>As of 2020-08-05, FS.COM states they have 5 warehouses in 4 locations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delaware (US)</li>
<li>Munich (Germany)</li>
<li>Melbourne (Australia)</li>
<li>Shenzhen (China)</li>
</ul>

<p>They recently built another, bigger (7 km²) warehouse in Shenzhen, and now
produce inventory for the whole year.</p>

<p>By 2019, FS.COM had over 300,000 registered corporate customers, reaching nearly
200 million USD yearly sales.</p>

<h2 id="delivery-times">Delivery times</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, delivery times are quick when the products are in stock at
FS.COM’s German warehouse.</p>

<p>In my case, I put in my order on 2020-Jun-26.</p>

<p>The items that shipped from the German warehouse arrived on 2020-Jul-01.</p>

<p>Some items had to be manufactured and/or shipped from Asia. Those items arrived
after 3 more weeks, on 2020-Jul-24.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, FS.COM doesn’t stock any 0.9mm fiber cables in their German
warehouse right now, so be prepared for a few weeks of waiting time.</p>

<h2 id="laying-the-fiber">Laying The Fiber</h2>

<p>Use a cable puller to pull the fiber through existing cable ducts where
possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In general, buy the thinnest one you can find. I have <a href="https://www.distrelec.ch/en/cable-pull-strap-10m-tools-495005/p/18092626">this 4mm diameter cable
puller</a>,
but a 3mm or even 2mm one would work in more situations.</p></li>

<li><p>I found it worthwhile to buy a brand one. It is distinctly better to handle
(less stiff, i.e. more flexible) than the cheap one I got, and thinner, too,
which is always good.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In my experience, it generally did not work well to <strong>push</strong> the fiber into an
existing duct or alongside an existing cable. I really needed a cable
<strong>puller</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky and have enough space in your duct(s), you can leave the
existing connectors on the fiber. I have successfully just used a piece of tape
to fix the fiber connector on the cable puller, pushing down the nose
temporarily:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable taped to cable puller"></a></p>

<p>Where there are no existing ducts, you may need to lay the fiber on top of the
wall. Obviously, this is tricky as soon as you need to make a connection going
through a wall: whereas copper ethernet cables can be bent and squeezed into
door frames, you quickly risk breaking fiber cables.</p>

<p>Luckily, the fiber is very light, so it’s very easy to fix to the wall with a
piece of tape:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cables on the wall"></a></p>

<p>You can see the upstream internet fiber in the top right corner, which is rather
thick in comparison to my 0.9mm yellow fiber that’s barely visible in the middle
of the picture.</p>

<p>Note how the fiber entirely disappears behind the existing duct atop the
door!</p>

<p>Above, you can see the flat ethernet cable I have been using as a temporary
experiment.</p>

<hr>

<p>Where there is an existing cable that you can temporarily remove, it might be
possible to remove it, put the fiber in, and put the old cable back in,
too. This is possible because the 0.9mm fiber cable is so thin!</p>

<p>I’m using this technique to cross another wall where the existing cable duct is
too full, but there is a cable that can be removed and put back after pulling
the fiber through:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing cable"></a></p>

<p>…and on the other side of the wall:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing socket"></a></p>

<p>Note how the fiber is thin enough to fit between the socket and duct!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> despite measuring how long a fiber cable I would need, my cable turned
out too short! While the cable was just as long as I had measured, with
distances exceeding 10m, it is a good idea to <strong>add a few meters spare</strong> on each
side of the connection.</p>

<h2 id="field-assembly-connectors">Field assembly connectors</h2>

<p>To give you an overview, these are the required steps at a high level:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the fiber with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/14346.html">Fibre Optic Kevlar Cutter</a></li>
<li>Strip the fiber with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/72812.html">Fibre Optical Stripper</a></li>
<li>Put the field assembly <em>jacket</em> onto the fiber</li>
<li>Cut the stripped fiber cleanly with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/14341.html">High Precision Fibre Optic Cleaver FS-08C</a></li>
<li>Put the field assembly <em>connector</em> onto the fiber</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>I thought the following resources were useful:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pictograms: <a href="https://img-en.fs.com/file/user_manual/lc-field-assembly-connector-quick-start-guide-v1.0.pdf">PDF: FS.COM LC UPC field assembley connectors quick start

<li>Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epTzemeJjAw">YouTube: Terminate Fiber in 5
Minutes</a>: this video shows a
different product, but I found it helpful to see any field assembly connector
on video, and this is one of the better videos I could find.</li>
</ol>

<!-- TODO: include a link to my own video once published -->

<hr>

<p><strong>Beware:</strong> the little paper booklet that comes with the field assembly
connector contains measurements which are <strong>not to scale</strong>. I have suggested to
FS.COM that they fix this, but until then, you’ll need to use e.g. a tape
measure.</p>

<hr>

<p>For establishing an intuition of their different sizes, here are the different connectors:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing socket"></a></p>

<p>From left to right:</p>

<ul>
<li>2.0mm fiber cable</li>
<li>cat6 ethernet cable</li>
<li>0.9mm fiber cable (LC/UPC factory)</li>
<li>0.9mm fiber cable (LC/UPC field assembly connector)</li>
</ul>

<p>The 0.9mm fiber cables come with smaller connectors than the 2.0mm fiber cables,
and that alone might be a reason to prefer them in some situations.</p>

<p>The field assembly connectors are pretty bulky in comparison, but since you can
attach them yourself after pulling only the cable through the walls and/or
ducts, you usually don’t care too …</p></div></div>

    <p>A hypothetical 5-year-old asks "I'm told the Sun is a big hot ball!  Awesome!  What color is the ball?".  Anecdotally, most astronomy graduate students will get this wrong.  And some professors.  So at least some science education misconceptions - basic, simple, significant, and easily falsifiable - are not restricted to introductory classes.  They persist into the profession, where they compromise textbooks, despite collaboration.  And survive for decades, despite awareness efforts.  Being largely ignored, it's an open question how typical this is,  and how much educational content might be improved by addressing it.  But for now, for correct crayon choice, ask a spectroscopist.</p>

          Are you tired of seeing wonderful insights in research talks, and knowing they won't reach introductory content for years?  I suggest the importance of direct research expertise, in creating accessible and powerful introductory content, is pervasively underestimated.

      <p><b><a href="http://www.clarifyscience.info/part/Atv6U">"What color is the Sun?" - <i>your</i> answer?</a></b>
    </p></div>
    <div>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The last decade of science education research surprised the education community. Student understanding turned out to be poorly integrated, non-transferable, and riddled with misconceptions. But an assumption exists, that student understanding eventually gets fixed.  That over the course of undergraduate and graduate work, ramshackle novice understanding becomes a qualitatively different expert understanding.  At least within the field studied.</p>
      <p>Here is one misconception that persists.  I suggest it illustrates a larger problem, with implications for curriculum and content creation.  And that we need to reassess who has sufficient expertise to create accessible and insightful content.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>A 5-year-old comes up to you and asks "I'm told the Sun is a big hot ball!  Awesome!  What color is the ball?"</p>
      <p>Take a moment, and say an answer.</p>
      <p>Anecdotally, most astronomy graduate students will get this wrong.  And at least some astronomy faculty.  For correct crayon choice, it appears the 5-year-old should ask a spectroscopist.</p>
      <p>Why?  In textbooks, the question isn't a focus, and its treatment is usually ambiguous.  The underlying problem I'll describe later.  The issue is known, with years of folks pointing out confused students and colleagues.  But awareness remains low, and little changes.</p>
      <p>The intriguing question is, how much better might content become, if more and better experts were used.  If a spectroscopist, rather than confused faculty, were asked "What color is the Sun?"  If K picture books, and graduate astronomy texts, both got the crayon color right.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Asking the question</h2>
      <p>
        'A hypothetical 5-year-old asks
        "I'm told the Sun is a big hot ball.  Awesome!  What color is the ball?"'
        I've asked this, conversationally, for several years.
        Small n, some tens, mostly MIT and Harvard graduate students.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting it wrong</h2>
      <p>
        I see five common answers, plus a few outliers.
        </p><ul>
          <li><i>yellow</i></li>
          <li><i>orange</i> and yellow and red</li>
          <li><i>rainbow</i>: "it doesn't have a color"; "it's lots of different colors"; "it's rainbow color"</li>
          <li><i>white</i></li>
          <li><i>5700 K</i></li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>
        The answer I expect depends on the person.
        </p><ul>
          <li>From the public, I expect <i>orange</i> or <i>yellow</i>.</li>
          <li>From astronomy students, undergraduate and graduate, I expect <i>yellow</i>, with a small minority of <i>white</i>.</li>
          <li>From astronomy post-docs, I've seen <i>white</i> and <i>yellow</i>.</li>
          <li>From non-astronomy graduate students in physical sciences, I expect <i>rainbow</i> or <i>yellow</i>, but also see the others.  I've seen <i>rainbow</i> from post-docs in several fields.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>
        <i>Yellow</i> is the most common answer.  A follow-up question of "what color is sunlight?" almost always results in recognition that something is wrong.
        <i>White</i> is an infrequent answer in all groups, except for astronomy post-docs, for whom I can't say.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>White</i> is unambiguously the correct answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is going on?
        "The Sun ball is white" is a concept accessible to 5-year-olds.
        So why do astronomy graduate students not know what color the Sun is?
        Why do physical-sciences graduate students not even know what <i>color</i> is?
        What implications might these have for science education content creation?
      </p>
      <h2>Implications</h2>
      <p>
        This failure mode is at least arguably atypical.  But it's existence has implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A misconception can... persist into graduate school.</b>
        While this is a single example, there is literature on ramshackle understanding persisting into professions.
        At least some of the perception that "misconceptions resolve" appears similar to the familiar "our teaching simply <i>must</i> be working" fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A misconception can... be an artifact of the field, not just of pedagogy.</b>
        With a feedback loop between misconception and poor content, stable for decades.
        In the current case, the field is unable to bring its collective understanding to bear on creating content.
        Diffusion of knowledge within the field, and textbooks' "hundreds of collaborators", are here not sufficient.
        Even in this field with a singular emphasis on terminal introductory courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Creating content requires better experts.  And more of them.</b>
        Not merely random faculty, whose expertise outside of their specific research area, unsurprisingly looks much like a graduate student.  For example.  An MIT microbiology professor writes a nifty children's' picture book on photosynthesis.  With such concern for correctness, that it has an errata page... which doesn't (yet) mention, the book's yellow Sun(s). This shouldn't surprise you now - an astronomy consult was needed for correct <span>crayon</span> paint choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Understanding can be poorly integrated and exercised.</b>
        "Sunlight is white" and "the Sun is yellow", don't make sense together.  Yet many astronomy graduate students believe both.   This undetected conflict among conceptions, demonstrates the existence of poorly integrated knowledge.  But they also instantly recognize them as inconsistent, when both are mentioned in these conversations.  Suggesting a long-term failure to exercise knowledge - that in all their years of study, these two concepts haven't collided before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Content could be better.  Much.</b>
        Consider integrated and transferable knowledge.  Well shaped and chosen building blocks, exercised to knock off misconceptions, fit and fused together as foundation and scaffolding.
        If you believe "the Sun is yellow", that misshaped block interferes with others.  Many related concepts don't make sense:
        blackbodies; star color; blue sky; how color works; and others.
        Making them in turn harder to learn.  And discouraging exercise, over this broken pavement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get it right, get it insightful, get it understood without misconceptions.  Even if failures to achieve these were rare, their impact could still be large.  And instead of rare, they are pervasive.  Suggesting the improvements in content over the coming decades, will not be a thing of refinement and decoration.  But something much more profound.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        How common is astronomy graduate students not knowing what color the Sun is?  And astronomy professors?  We don't know.  These anecdotes don't stretch that far.  I look forward to someone testing it.

        What is clear, is that at least some graduate students are confused.  In ways that surprise people.  And which suggest content needs to be better.  And can be.

      <h2>Methods - Question design</h2>
      <p>
        The core question is "What color is the Sun?".  The rest is there to constrain people's answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "ball" helps clarify intent - 'object, viewed from space', not 'eyeball observation made through atmosphere'.  It works well, but not always.  Some "red or orange" responses remain.  And it creates guarded "well, under &lt;some eyeball condition&gt;, it looks &lt;color&gt;" responses.  These can be fixed with a reply like "yes, and viewed through rock it's black - but what is it itself?".  Cone saturation almost never comes up.
        </p><p>
          The "5-year-old" is better way of saying "one-word common color name".  Getting such names from people is <i>hard</i>.  As is creating recognition that not providing one constitutes failing to answer the question.  Without the 5-year-old, puzzled people start rifting through everything they vaguely remember that might be related, and finally end with a "did I get it?".  Some responses of "5700 Kelvin" remain, but can be fixed by replying "5-year-old!", or "the 5-year-old looks puzzled".  The 5-year-old also makes the conversation more upbeat - 'helping a child', instead of 'suffering a quiz'.  And it reduces the frequency of "well, does it really matter what color the Sun is?".
        </p>
        <p>
          The "What color is sunlight?" follow-up is an easy way to demonstrate that some answer was wrong.  The "sunlight is white" meme is widespread, and its recitation so reflexive, that the response almost always precedes the "oh, then that doesn't make sense, does it?" moment.  It also provides a nice illustration of knowledge being poorly …</p></div></div></div>

August 9, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/how-i-got-my-japanese-pr.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/how-i-got-my-japanese-pr.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2018 I applied for and received Permanent Residency in Japan. The process I
used is relatively new and unknown so I wanted to document it in case it might
come in handy for someone else.</p>
<h2 id="my-background"> My Background</h2>
<p>In 2011 I graduated with a Master's degree from Brown University and then moved
to Japan and got a job as a software engineer. I am not married. I am fluent in
Japanese but would not be mistaken for a native speaker. I am a citizen of the
United States.</p>
<h2 id="highly-skilled-foreign-professional"> Highly Skilled Foreign Professional</h2>
<p>There are three main ways to qualify for Permanent Residency in Japan.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can be a resident for 10 years or more on a work visa, or a smaller number of years on a marriage visa.</li>
<li>You can make a significant contribution to Japan (<a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/nyuukokukanri/kouhou/nyukan_nyukan36.html">我が国への貢献</a>), such as personally contributing to an Olympic victory by coaching, winning a similarly prestigious prize, or getting a medal from the Emperor.</li>
<li>You can use the Highly Skilled Foreign Professional visa system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Highly Skilled Foreign Professional visa is a points-based visa system
introduced in 2012. It seems to have been modeled on points-based visa systems
introduced in Australia. The basic idea is that based on things like income,
educational history, and language ability you get points, and if you have
enough points you can apply for a special visa. In 2017, on average 352 people
a month were accepted in the visa program. (see graph 1-3-3 on page 27
<a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000627735.pdf">here</a>)</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the HSFP visa is a fast track to Permanent Residency.
When it was first introduced you could apply for a PR after five years on the
HSFP visa, as opposed to ten years on a normal work visa. Over time the fast
track became even faster, and in 2018 you could apply after three years or even
just one year if you had enough points. What changed in 2017 was that if you
could demonstrate that you had the points historically you could apply for a PR
without ever having the HSFP visa. That's the process I used.</p>
<h2 id="the-points"> The Points</h2>
<p>The way points calculation works is you calculate your points at the start of
the term (so one or three years ago) and at the time of your application for a
PR, and submit a separate point sheet for each of those times.</p>
<p>There are three categories of HSFP visa: academic, specialist/technical, and
business management. I was in the specialist/technical category, which covers
more than 80% of applicants. Some point sources are shared between all three
categories, but they do have significant differences in where most points come
from. For example, if you apply with the academic category, published papers
become an important criteria for points.</p>
<p>Excluding salary, here's my point breakdown. Note that this uses the rules at
the time of my application in 2018, and they have changed slightly since then,
and are likely to continue to change over time. You can view the current points
sheet as an Excel file at the <a href="http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_3/en/evaluate/index.html">Immigration Bureau site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Master's Degree: 20 points</li>
<li>5-7 years of work experience: 10 points</li>
<li>Age less than 30: 15 points</li>
<li>JLPT N1: 15 points</li>
<li>Highly ranked school bonus: 10 points</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a total of 70 points at the time of my application (again, excluding
salary). 70 points is already enough to qualify for the three-year fast track.
A year before my application I only had the JLPT N2 (10 points) for a slightly
lower total of 65. That means that with a salary of five million yen a year or
more (roughly 50,000USD, worth 15 points) I would be eligible for the one-year
fast track.</p>
<p>There are a number of other bonuses I didn't qualify for, or may have qualified
for but didn't investigate because I already had enough points. When the system
was introduced it was relatively hard to get enough points to qualify, but over
time it's gotten easier. For example, initially only the JLPT N1 was worth
points, but later the N2 was added as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-reason-letter"> The Reason Letter</h2>
<p>Most of the paperwork required for the PR application is unremarkable. One
major exception is the 理由書 or "reason letter". The reason letter is required
when applying for a PR from a work visa, but the <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/IMMIGRATION/ZAIRYU_EIJYU/zairyu_eijyu03.html#content:~:text=%E6%B0%B8%E4%BD%8F%E8%A8%B1%E5%8F%AF%E3%82%92%E5%BF%85%E8%A6%81%E3%81%A8%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E7%90%86%E7%94%B1%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%EF%BC%8C%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E3%81%AA%E5%BD%A2%E5%BC%8F%E3%81%A7%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E4%B8%8B%E3%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%80%82">only guidance</a> is
that there is no fixed format. What on earth are you supposed to write in it?</p>
<p>By looking at websites run by immigration lawyers and blog posts from various
people, it seems the conventional wisdom is that you should briefly state your
educational history and how you came to Japan. You also need to explain your
reason for seeking the PR, but "I want to keep living in Japan" is not
appropriate.</p>
<p>Typical reasons to use here are an intention to raise a family or needing a PR
in order to get a loan. (Anyone can own property in Japan, but it's difficult
to get a mortgage if you don't have a PR.) Neither of those applied to me so I
struggled with what to put in the letter. Eventually I settled on describing
several reasons I was invested in staying in Japan, with supporting documentation.</p>
<p>Besides discussing my day job, one point was my work on Japanese NLP projects.
At the time of my application I was working on adding Japanese support to
<a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>, and as part of implementing Universal Dependencies I needed to
contact <a href="https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/">NINJAL</a>, who were incredibly kind in responding to a request from a
random Internet person. I described this as part of an ongoing personal effort
to make Japanese NLP easier, which continues now that I maintain a
popular <a href="https://github.com/SamuraiT/mecab-python3">Python tokenizer for Japanese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/polm">other projects</a>.</p>
<p>Another point was my work with <a href="https://www.tokyoindies.com/">Tokyo Indies</a>, the largest monthly game
development gathering in Tokyo, where I'm on staff. Tokyo Indies had media
coverage from a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/matome/f2books/indies01.html">Famitsu subsidiary</a> and the <a href="https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/mv/wbs/archive?date=2017-10-03">WBS television program</a>,
which made good supporting documents showing both the importance of the event
and my involvement in it.</p>
<p>A third point, different from the first two, was using the reason letter to
explain issues with my other supporting documentation. One of the required
documents for a PR application is a bank statement showing financial
independence in the form of savings or steady income. A few months before my PR
application I broke my leg, and I was unable to walk without crutches for three
months, two of which I was on unpaid leave. The reason letter gave me a place
to explain the situation (and attach X-rays).</p>
<h2 id="the-application-and-the-wait"> The Application and the Wait</h2>
<p>I actually composed my PR application during the considerable downtime I had
after breaking my leg, and went to Immigration on crutches towards the end of
my recovery process. When handing over my documents the person at the counter
was impressed by their tidyness, though all I'd done was use the <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/IMMIGRATION/16-4.html#content:~:text=%E7%94%B3%E8%AB%8B%E6%9B%B8%E6%A7%98%E5%BC%8F">officially
provided Excel template</a> to fill it out.</p>
<p>One thing I was told at the counter was that I could provide a copy of my N2
certificate instead of the original. Official instructions say all supporting
documents generally have to be original, but I was told it was OK to copy my
US-issued N2 cert because it was hard to get it replaced. (Looking at <a href="https://www.aatj.org/jlpt-old-scores">current
re-issuance instructions</a> it doesn't look that bad, perhaps the
process has changed since my application.)</p>
<p>I also asked about whether I needed to submit a copy of my degree. I assumed I
didn't since I'd submitted one with my initial visa application years before
and figured it was still on file. I was told it was probably fine without it.
(It wasn't, but I'll get to that later.)</p>
<p>I applied in late January 2018 and was told that it would take a year to
process my application. This was a bit of a surprise, as Immigration's site
said it usually takes 4-6 months. Apparently the recent change in requirements
for PR applications had increased both the number of applicants and the amount
of time required per application as Immigration got used to the new rules.</p>
<p>In late September I got a letter from Immigration about an issue with my
documents. It turned out they needed a copy of my degree, submitted by mail
within two weeks. I had not expected this and it was nearly a problem - my
degrees were at my parents' house in America, and they don't use the Internet,
let alone a scanner. It took a nervous few days but my brother who lives nearby
managed to get the degrees and send me scans of them.</p>
<p>That presented another problem - I had forgotten, but my degree was in Latin.
All documents submitted as part of an application have to be translated into
Japanese, and I don't speak Latin. (Maybe they wouldn't really care about a
degree, but I didn't want to take any chances.) Luckily Brown has <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/http%3A/www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/academic-records/replacement-diplomas/english-tra">an English
translation</a> of their degrees, but that presented another problem - the
text of the degree reads like magical language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TO ALL WHO ARE ABOUT TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, EVERLASTING GREETINGS IN THE LORD.</p>
<p>BE IT KNOWN TO YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE AUTHORITY
ENTRUSTED TO HER/HIM BY THE BOARD OF FELLOWS HAS BESTOWED IN PUBLIC ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>AND TO HIM/HER HAS GIVEN TO ENJOY ALL THE PRIVILEGES AND RIGHTS AND HONORS AND
SYMBOLS PERTAINING TO THOSE ADVANCED TO THIS DEGREE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ended up writing a sheet explaining the degree was mostly formulaic language
including "appeals to God etc." and just translating the gist of it as "A
Degree in X is bestowed on Y". On the copy of the degree I circled the
important parts ("SCIENTIA COMPUTATORIA" is "Computer Science") and translated
them. I mailed the degree in time.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>In late November the small postcard that implies acceptance came, and I took a
day off to go and get my new Residence Card. The process was short and
unremarkable. Since I had spare time and no plans I ended up going by my ward
office to update my My Number Card, deeply confusing the staff with a freshly
issued card not yet reflected in some databases and an unusual procedure, but
that got sorted too. (I did end up having to fill out a Change of Address form
with no Change of Address, but such is paperwork.)</p>
<p>In total it took ten months from application to acceptance, which while long
was less than the year I was quoted. Looking at posts by immigration lawyers
online it looks like the fastest applications around this time took eight
months. I …</p></div></div>

        <div>
          <p>Have you ever "gone the other way", by which I mean where most people use product A then usually "grow up" or "evolve" and use product B, and you went the other way! B to A. A made up example of B to A would be ridesharing apps -&gt; calling a taxi service on the phone.</p>
<p>In the software world, when you go the other way you notice how all the blog posts, online help is not really helpful at all. They assume you'd only ever go A -&gt; B.</p>
<p>Examples of this I have found are: moving from AWS to Heroku for hosting or from Ledger-CLI to YNAB4 for budgeting. </p>
<p>I'll cover the first of those examples in this article. I will talk about going from AWS to Heroku for the tryjobalerts.com site hosting and data processing.</p>
<h2 id="william-shock-yes-bill-shock">William Shock. Yes... Bill Shock.</h2>
<p>I'm guessing many of you have tried the generous free year of AWS services, and then got your first bill on the 13th month and said "errr. OK". That happened to me and prompted me to cull or move out a load of stuff running in AWS. On the flip side, I was amazed at how cheap SES is - I think my bill was $0.10, and how expensive Elastic Search is, where my bill was $50 for a hardly used cluster. I would have not been suprised to see those numbers reversed.</p>
<p>However before the bill, I had started off moving EC2 servers to Heroku. The reason wasn't cost - Heroku is typically a little more expensive as it provides additional wrapping and services over cloud infrastructre. I moved for the obvious reason that I'm lazy. Which is a codeword for good time prioritisation. I don't want to manage a operating system, server or CI pipeline. Instead I want an expert to take care of that for me for an extra $5 a month. </p>
<p>The point where I switched from EC2 to Heroku wasn't a well thought out logical decision, based on sitting on a leather couch, musing about software architecture. It was an emotional decision based on my node app crashing, and all my services for tryjobalerts.com being out of action for 5 minutes and counting. What if someone tries to edit their settings and they get an error page? how embarassing. Although not that unusual these days, I didn't want to be the one.</p>
<p>What to do next? Well, in the time honoured solution of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn2FB1P_Mn8">"turning it off and on again"</a>, I restarted the EC2 instance and BaaM! the node app crashed again. Whatever it did, it took out the machine in such a way I couldn't connect to it via SSH to fix the problem. By this point I rashly decided to move to Heroku. I just didn't have the heart to fix this shit when I wanted to be coding. And I knew this would likely happen again and again, and I'd probably end up on the slow march towards Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Was that a hasty decision? Well maybe it was, but it had been a subconcious thought for quite a while. Setting up nginx, let's encyrpt, PM2 etc. etc. was mildly intersting but feels like a distraction from what I am really trying to do. I am happy for someone else to deal with that, and if everything dies, build them up again. I'll concentrate on the code, thank you very much.</p>
<p>I gave Heroku a try. I thought, let's just see how easy it is. If it "just works" I'll switch over. Otherwise I'm downloading k8s (joking!). I was working on this while the site was out like a light, no one could access their settings, sign up or receive an email - so no pressure.</p>
<p>Moving to Heroku was redicuously easy. I just had to create a file called Procfile with this in it:</p>
<pre><code>web: node distjs/node/index.js
worker: node distjs/bot/index.js</code></pre><p>And set up a few things in the Heroku UI - secrets and such like. I also had to change the port express run on from a fixed port 3001 to the number Heroku provides as an environment variable. Within 15 minutes I say I had it working, sans DNS entries.</p>
<p>I kept SES and PSQL on AWS, and everything worked lovely.</p>
<p>I kept things this way for a few weeks. I then got that bigger than expected bill from AWS, including a fair amount for the PSQL. Nothing too catastophic but it didn't seem like good value for money. </p>
<h2 id="heroku-has-a-weird-limit-for-psql-hobby-basic">Heroku has a weird limit for PSQL Hobby Basic</h2>
<p>I noticed Heroku offers a "Hobby Basic" $9/month PSQL with up to 10M rows. It turns out I use a decent amount of space in TEXT fields, but not too many rows. So I migrated to that. Yes unbelievably I am migrating something from AWS to Heroku to save money.</p>
<p>The limit is weird, being based on number of rows rather than storage size. I wonder how much excellent data you can store as blobs in 10M rows - maybe I should keep quiet as the Heroku Product Owner could be reading.</p>
<p>I searched online for the best way to move the data over. I like Stack Overflow because if someone has had a war story you hear about it instead of experiencing it first hand. However most of the advice online is how to get your data out of Heroku into AWS. Going the other way. </p>
<p>Therefore I tried a couple of ways. It turned out it was easy enough to use psql command line tools <code>pg_dump</code> and <code>pg_restore</code>. It worked first time and took about 30 minutes to do - most of the time was me doing housework while waiting for <code>pg_restore</code> to do it's work.</p>
<p>(Incase it's helpful to anyone, the tip here is don't use the Heroku CLI, get the connection details from the Heroku portal, and use the psql standard tools.)</p>
<p>It is quite amazing to me that Heroku turns out to be cheaper on the PSQL database. It might be because they don't offer as much power as RDS, although they are using AWS in some capacity - perhaps they manage the VM themselves. </p>
<p>It could be that Heroku is happy to lose a bit of money on that Hobby Basic tier, or they more aggressively share resources than AWS does in RDS, so under load it would crack sooner.</p>
<p>Heroku's Hobby Basic PSQL doesn't offer rollbacks, and that could be another reason it's cheap. It means I need to take care of backups myself, however this can be automated quite easily with a periodic dump of the DB.</p>
<h2 id="dont-be-too-cheap-though">Don't be too cheap though</h2>
<p>The big mistake I made when moving to Heroku was to try and use the free dynos. Only do this for non-production MVPs. By using the free ones, I had to do a lot of work setting up SSL with Cloudflare, and I never quite got it to work. </p>
<p>I then realised I needed the paid dynos anyway because the free ones cannot be restarted (!) without a deployment. So I upgraded, and then the SSL was sorted. No Cloudflare needed. Had I done that in the first place I'd have saved a couple of hours of frustrating DNS hacking.</p>
<p>It's always a fine line. I mean you try to save money where you can, but sometimes you don't know in advance what the free-tier traps are. Maybe Heroku could make this more obvious, but they did warn that free dynos are mainly for hobby use, so fair enough.</p>
<h2 id="herokus-herokus-£2-a-lb">Herokus! Herokus! £2 a lb!</h2>
<p>I sound like a Heroku salesman at this point. There are other "Platform as a Service" offerings out there. I had just used Heroku before in 2014, and liked that it still existed, so I used that. However there could be better options for you, check them out. Or maybe a regular old cloud like AWS is what you needed all along.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's OK to go the other way, choose whatever makes sense for the project you are doing.</p>

                    <p>There is nothing like a good rant!&nbsp; It may not

					<span lang="en-gb">fix the issue that initiated the </span>rant, but it feels so <em>good </em>afterwards.</p>

                    <p>This rant is about the suggestion that the use of a
                    ‘z’ in words like nationalization is somehow
                    wrong, or American. It must be admitted that there are
                    words with a ‘z’ in them that are purely
                    American, like advertize, or maybe just wrong, like
                    surmize. Sometimes it is simply error — a word whose
                    spelling is not known, and whose correct spelling is not
                    sought, is arbitrarily given a ‘z’ in the
                    honest but mistaken belief it is correct. Sometimes words
                    with a z-form in American represent an older (perhaps
                    Elizabethan) form of English that made its way to the USA
                    before the language was standardized in England. More
                    likely, the American ‘z’ is one of Noah
                    Webster’s attempts to ‘standardize’ or
                    ‘improve’ American usage of English when he
                    produced his famous dictionary in 1828, in which his
                    decision to make deliberate and extensive revisions of
                    spelling was implemented — he has been described as a great
                    spelling reformer (I also had a go at reforming spelling
                    when I was at school but it wasn’t appreciated).
                    Webster evidently decided to use a ‘z’ wherever
                    he considered the pronunciation called for it. This was a 
					highly unusual example of a dictionary leading the written 
					language rather than attempting to reflect it.</p>

                    <p>This polemic is nothing to do with the Americans. If we
                    overlook the various words that the Americans deliberately
                    choose to spell differently, the majority of words that take a
                    ‘z’, or an ‘s’ that is pronounced
                    like a ‘z’, seem to fall very clearly into
                    those that must take an ‘s’ (like
                    <em>compromise</em>, where the derivation is
                    –misser), those that must take a ‘z’,
                    (like <em>prize</em>), and the rest, about which
                    controversy apparently rages (if only here).</p>

                    <p>I have been to a great deal of trouble to look into
                    this, looking not only at various text books and style manuals,
                    but also at a range of literature over the years to see
                    which spelling was preferred. I refer only to cases of the 
					third type given above where writers <span lang="en-gb">or 
					their publishers </span>have come to regard the 
					use of 's' as an acceptable alternative to the 'z' (we are 
					all agreed that misuse of the two other types would be an 
					error).</p>

                    <p>It seems to me that in books printed in England the use
                    of the ‘z’ overwhelmingly predominated until
                    the Second World War, though on a far smaller scale the
                    ‘s’ can be found used by some printing houses,
                    even in Victorian times. Textbooks set out the correctness
                    of using ‘z’, some of them setting out in
                    considerable detail the rationale for use of
                    ‘s’ or ‘z’ depending on origin.
                    After the Second World War the ‘s’ alternative
                    is more frequently offered as a possibility and some house
                    style manuals (though not Oxford’s) indicate a
                    preference for ‘s’ — not because of any
                    suggestion that ‘z’ is wrong, mark you, but
                    because ‘s’ had come to be tolerated and it avoided
                    having to remember which usage is which. Recent manuals and
                    dictionaries seem to have given up on the prescriptive use
                    of a ‘z’, though it is usually offered as an
                    alternative where correct.</p>

                    <p>It seems to me, summarizing, and using a ‘z’
                    correctly and non-Americanly, that:</p>
					

                    <p>For myself, I am very happy to keep using a
                    ‘z’ where it is appropriate, and I do try hard
                    to get it right but must admit to being inconsistent
                    sometimes. <span lang="en-gb">Using the ‘z’ form</span>, of course, invites people to pick me up on
                    it, whence I refer them to the Oxford English Dictionary
                    (the big one) and that generally ends the matter. On the 
					whole it is not a book to pick a fight with.</p>

                    <p>I suppose even after being presented with the facts
                    there will be people who will persist with the
                    ‘s’ option, and that’s up to them —
                    nothing more I can do. All I ask is that people determined
                    to use the ‘s’ do not regard those using the
                    ‘z’ as using Americanisms!!!</p>

                    <p>Many of the great publishing houses are happy with ‘
                    <em>-ize</em>’ etc endings, and large, influential
                    organizations such as London Transport invariably used the
                    ‘- <em>ize’ </em>form in posters and other public
                    communications, though their modern PC-originated material
                    leaves much to be desired.</p>

                    <p>I attach below <span lang="en-gb">(actually it is in the 
					next column) </span>various references that shed more light
                    on the matter. Note that some house style guidance which
                    has opted for the '- <em>ise</em>' form refers to
                    alleged controversy about the more correct spelling about
                    which 'the authorities differ'. House style guides
                    are not authorities of themselves, although they may rely
                    on them and refer to them. Of the ‘authorities’ I
                    have sought, they all indicate '- <em>ize</em>' as
                    etymologically correct and I have not yet found any
                    'authority' that explains how '-
                    <em>ise</em>' can be correct; if any reader knows of
                    one I'd be glad to hear of it and will be happy to
                    quote it below.</p>

                    <p>And do I feel better? Well as a matter of fact, I rather
                    think I do.</p>

                    should be used where both spellings are in use. Generally,
                    <em>-ize</em> is a suffix applied to the stems of nouns

                    transistor&nbsp;− transistorize</p>

                    <p>The ending -ise is correct when the
                    noun has <em>–is ­</em>as part of the stem, e.g.
                    in the syllables <em>-vis­</em> (seeing), -cis-

August 9, 2020 | https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-orge37fcf2">
<p> The C++ standard does not specify how virtual functions should be implemented. In practice, however, compilers generate a virtual function table and place a pointer to it as the first member of a class. Multiple inheritance complicates things, but let’s not jump into that rabbit hole for now. Instead, consider the following C++ class: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>class</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>virtual</span> ~<span>A</span>();
  <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>);
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Since the structure of the virtual function table is not standardized, compilers may use different layouts. The layout used by the GCC compiler is this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>A_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>; <span>// </span><span>Pointer to type information</span>
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>A</span>*); <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);    <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Virtual function pointers are laid out in declaration order. The <code>A_vtable</code> structure reveals another C++ secret: member functions are just obfuscated versions of normal functions that get <code>this</code> as the first argument. That’s it. If you know Python, D or Nim, this won’t surprise you a bit. </p>
<p> The fact that C++ has a dedicated syntax for member functions leads to numerous problems which I’m not going to detail here. Fixes have been proposed since at least 2004, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/705855444049399808">to no avail</a>. The <code>std::function</code> class however had to do it the right way, so we ended up with a language that has one syntax as a language feature and another as a standard library feature. </p>
<p> OK, enough whining. Back to our original track. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler actually generates</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A_func</span>(<span>A</span>* <span>this</span>, <span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p> Generated member function names are actually much more complicated due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C++">name mangling</a>. </p>
<p> There is one virtual table that is shared by all instances of <code>class A</code>, and the compiler will statically initialize it for you by placing the addresses of <code>A</code>‘s member functions and the generated type info into it. About like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>const</span> <span>A_vtable</span> <span>A_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;A_type_info,  <span>// </span><span>We'll skip this now</span>
  &amp;A_destructor, <span>// </span><span>Pointer to an ordinary function</span>
  &amp;A_func        <span>// </span><span>Ditto</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Now, whenever you create an instance of <code>class A</code>, you actually instantiate a structure like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>class_A</span>
{
  <span>A_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> The compiler will initialize the <code>vtable</code> pointer for you. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>A</span> <span>a</span>;

<span>// </span><span>What actually happens</span>
<span>class_A</span> <span>a</span>;
a.vtable = &amp;A_vtable_instance;
</pre>
</div>
<p> If you derive <code>B</code> from <code>A</code>, this is what happens (conceptually): </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>class</span> <span>B</span> : <span>public</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>override</span>;
  <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>func2</span>() <span>const</span>; <span>// </span><span>A new virtual function</span>
};

<span>int</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) {}

<span>void</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func2</span>() <span>const</span> {}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler generates</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>B_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>;
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>B</span>*);
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);
  <span>void</span> (*<span>func2</span>)(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*);
};

<span>// </span><span>Auto-generated default destructor.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_destructor</span>(<span>B</span>* <span>b</span>)
{
  A_destructor((<span>A</span>*)b);
}

<span>int</span> <span>B_func</span>(<span>B</span>*, <span>int</span>) {}

<span>// </span><span>Member function qualifiers are actually qualifiers</span>
<span>// </span><span>of the this pointer.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_func2</span>(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*) {}

<span>// </span><span>Note that the first three members have the same</span>
<span>// </span><span>layout as A_vtable, which means we can safely access</span>
<span>// </span><span>a B_vtable pointer as an A_vtable pointer.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>B_vtable</span> <span>B_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;B_type_info,
  &amp;B_destructor,
  &amp;B_func,
  &amp;B_func2
};

<span>struct</span> <span>class_B</span>
{
  <span>B_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Whenever your code calls a virtual function in <code>A</code>, the compiler looks up the actual function to call through the virtual function table: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>B</span> <span>b</span>;
<span>A</span>* <span>a</span> = &amp;b;
a-&gt;func(1);

<span>// </span><span>You get</span>
<span>class_B</span> <span>b</span>;
b.vtable = &amp;B_vtable_instance;
<span>class_A</span>* <span>a</span> = &amp;b;
a-&gt;vtable-&gt;func(a, 1);
</pre>
</div>
</div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>For a long time, business software was clunky. Consumer software continued to radically innovate on user experience, staying ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Palm to iPhone. Styluses to capacitive touch. Taxis to Ubers. Torrents to Netflix. MP3s to Spotify, etc. We’ve lived through this story of how innovation in consumer software radically improved our lives in the last decade.</p>
<p>At one point, business software had no choice but to stop being clunky and terrible to use, because nobody wanted to walk into work to use shitty software. And as teams got more power to pick the software they wanted, business software had no choice but to be simple enough for anyone to try and buy.</p>
<p>If a business application wasn’t easy to use, people just abandoned it and start trialing something else.&nbsp;Apps that had the best user experience started winning more often at work than the ones that didn’t.</p>
<p>Everyone called this trend ‘consumerization of business software/IT’. Dropbox, Google Drive, Docs and Sheets, etc led this era. But despite all efforts by business apps to keep things simple, consumer software continued to set the gold standard in user experience. Business software just followed the direction already set by consumer software products.</p>
<p>However, I think the scene is changing.</p>

<p>Look at Slack. Zoom. Typeform. They’ve gone above and beyond what we’d have expected of business software some years ago. They’re trendsetters in providing delightful user experiences, and they come out far ahead of similar consumer products in this space.</p>
<p>Can you think of another mainstream video calling software that’s as good as Zoom, for consumers? I can’t. About four weeks ago, my friends and I wanted to talk over WhatsApp but the app capped video call participants at 4. The quality of WhatsApp calls isn’t that great either (remember the “Reconnecting…” flashes?).</p>
<p><span> Zoom was top of mind for me because we use it at work every day. We switched to Zoom and everything worked just fine – there were no hiccups during the call, no onboarding problems, nothing at all. Seven people discovered Zoom that day, and all of them loved their first call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know several other folks who are defaulting to Zoom to stay in touch with their friends during this work-from-home season, despite WhatsApp, etc. being a tap away on their phones. That is saying <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> about how ahead of the pack Zoom is when it comes to group video/audio calling. Far ahead of consumer software in this space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I’m going to unpack what’s happening here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, <strong>a product that we use at work, nailed the calling experience.</strong> That’s a stark contrast from how sucky business software used to be, a decade ago.</li>
<li>Zoom enjoys <strong>fantastic brand recall</strong> – people spend hours on Zoom meetings every week (if not every day) so it’s on top of our minds when we’re thinking about calling our friends or family (ahead of consumer products that live in our phones.)</li>
<li>WhatsApp, <strong>a consumer product, didn’t impress us</strong> with the one job it was supposed to do (arbitrary limits be damned). Wasn’t consumer software supposed to be the gold standard in terms of user experience?</li>
<li>Seven of us <strong>switched to Zoom instantly</strong> and many of us went back to work to convince our closest teams to start using Zoom (network effects!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Business software like Zoom, etc. are so good that they’re winning against consumer software! If you said that to the person who had to deal with on-premise software and implementations ten or fifteen years ago, they’d certainly not believe it.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of products go from consumer to enterprise – Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. launched versions for work after they succeeded in the consumer space. But with us relying on work apps day in and day out and realizing that they’re so delightfully built, we are naturally taking them outside of our work lives and introducing them to our friends and family.</p>
<p>This is a massive opportunity that I think organizations are slowly realizing they need to chase – Microsoft, for instance, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/30/introducing-new-microsoft-365-personal-family-subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just launched</a> personal and family subscriptions for Office 365. Lots of people <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already use</a> Asana (and even Slack!) to organize their personal lives.</p>
<p>Even if revenue from consumers doesn’t significantly add to the bottom line for companies like Zoom etc., getting regular users to vouch about your product is definitely going to help take the brand mainstream (think about how well Skype is recognized even today, only because it was available for consumers for so long!).</p>
<p>That’s only going to lead to a cycle of more people discovering these products back at work – helping improve adoption for the business version.</p>
<p>And that’s something nobody will refuse wanting!</p>

<p>
  This is a demo of compiling and running <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> assembly in JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  Press the button to see it compile and run a tiny "hello world" program. You can also try modifying the LLVM assembly and pressing the button again - note though that <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM assembly</a> is typed, so if you add characters to the string for example, you will need to adjust its length, both where it is defined and where it is used (otherwise you will get errors, which will show up in the output area).
</p>



<hr>

<br>





<hr>
<p>
  This demo works by using parts of the LLVM toolchain (llvm-dis and llvm-as), compiled by <a href="http://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a> from C++ to JavaScript, to check the assembly for errors and pretty-print it. Then the emscripten compiler (originally written in JavaScript, but ported from the normal batch/shell mode to the browser environment) is run on the output, and the code executed directly.
</p>
<p>
  This demo was done as a fun hacking project over a holiday vacation, so there are some caveats: The generated code is not optimized at all, so benchmarking is pointless; if you want to benchmark, run emscripten normally with <code>-O2</code>. Compilation speed has also not been optimized at all. Also, this demo has hardly been tested and glues together several codebases in ways they were not originally intended, there might be things that do not work.

It is also one of the poorest, with an annual&nbsp;per capita income of $870 US (<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD">at purchasing power parity</a>).</p>   <p>"When you are in Malawi and someone asks you, 'Where do you go to church?' and you say you don't pray, it's an awkward thing, like you're a weird person," says Teresa Chirwa, a journalist from Malawi who is spending an academic year at the University of Toronto.</p>   <p>The majority of Malawians belong to one of several Christian denominations (including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian and the African Independent Churches),&nbsp;while another 15 to 20 per cent are Muslim. Much of the population also practices traditional African religions.</p>   <p>In recent years, new Pentecostal churches have begun to take hold, and the younger generation has started making its own choices about which churches to attend&nbsp;— rather than following&nbsp; their parents' beliefs, said Chirwa.</p>   <p>"Kids are revolting," she said. "They are leaving the traditional churches and going to the new churches that are emerging."</p>   <p>The country now also has its&nbsp;first atheist organization, although so far, except for its leader, the names of all its members remain secret.</p>   <p>"They're being ridiculed by the society," said Chirwa. "They're being discriminated against for those beliefs."</p>  </div>  <p>Gregory Paul doesn't think it can. After constructing a "Successful Societies Scale" that compared 25 socioeconomic indicators against statistics on religious belief and practice in 17 developed nations, the Baltimore-based paleontologist concluded in a&nbsp;2009 study&nbsp;that "religion is most able to thrive in seriously dysfunctional societies."</p>  <p>Paul, who is a freelance researcher not affiliated with any institution, compiled data on everything from homicide rates and income inequality&nbsp;to infant mortality and teenage pregnancies and found that the societies that scored&nbsp;the best&nbsp;on socioeconomic indicators were also the most secular.</p>  <p>"The correlation between religiosity and successful societies is somewhere around 0.7. Zero&nbsp;is no correlation and&nbsp;one is a perfect correlation, so it's a really good correlation, and it's not just an accident," he told CBC News.</p>  <p>"There's no situation where you have a really highly religious nation that's highly successful socially."</p>  <p>Paul's intention in creating the scale was to&nbsp;challenge the idea that religion is universal and innate to the human condition, and to show that societies that don't believe in God are not doomed, as some religious conservatives would have people believe.</p>  <p>"Religion is highly variable, and therefore we need to ask why is it sometimes popular and why it isn't,"&nbsp;Paul said. "One thing we do know is that it's only popular in societies that&nbsp;… have enough rate of dysfunction that people are anxious about their daily lives, so they're looking to the gods for help in their daily lives.</p>  <p>"It's not fear of death that drives people to be religious, and it's not a God gene or a God module in the brain or some sort of connection with the gods; it's basically a psychological coping mechanism."</p>  <h3>Religion on decline in West</h3>  <p>Belief in God and participation in religious services have been on the decline in recent decades in most First World nations but have remained high in developing countries. Between 1947 and 2001, belief in God declined by 33.6 per cent in Sweden, 19.9 per cent in Australia and 7.2 per cent in Canada, according to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Articles/Articles%20published%20in%20journals_files/ppr2006%20norris.pdf">analysis</a>&nbsp;of social science surveys done by Harvard sociologist Pippa Norris and University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart.</p>  <p>Data for&nbsp;developing countries does not go back as far, but recent&nbsp;opinion polls&nbsp;suggest religiosity has remained high. The 10 most religious countries on the&nbsp;2012 WIN-Gallup International Religiosity and Atheism Index&nbsp;all had 85 per cent or more of respondents identifying as "a religious person," and all were countries with a per capita income&nbsp;of less than &nbsp;$14,100 US.</p>    <p>When Norris and Inglehart&nbsp;pooled 20 years of results from the World Values Survey, which regularly polls dozens of countries on social science questions, they found that in agrarian societies, 44 per cent of people said they attended church at least once a week compared to 25 per cent in industrial and 20 per cent in postindustrial societies. They also found that nations&nbsp;that scored&nbsp;low on the&nbsp;<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/">Human Development Index</a>, which measures health, education and living standards,&nbsp;tended to be those&nbsp;with the highest rates of participation in religious services and prayer.</p>  <div>   <h2>Religion, faith and belief</h2>   <p>This story launches a CBC News series looking at religion, faith and belief in our world.</p>  </div>  <p>More recent polls have found similar divisions between rich and poor nations. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx">2009 Gallup Inc. religion survey</a>, which sampled about 1,000 people in each of 114 countries, found that among nations with a per capita income of less than $2,000, 95 per cent of respondents, in the median, answered "Yes" to the question: "Is religion an important part of your daily life?"</p>  <p>In countries with per capita income of more than $25,000, 47 per cent of respondents answered "Yes." In Canada, 42 per cent of respondents said religion was important.</p>  <p>Bangladesh, Niger, Malawi and Yemen had some of the strongest&nbsp;positive responses (99 per cent) while Sweden (17 per cent), Denmark (19 per cent), Japan (24 per cent) and Estonia (16 per cent)&nbsp;— where religion was suppressed under the former Soviet regime&nbsp;— had some of the weakest.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>People walk past the Great Mosque in the ancient desert city of Agadez, Niger.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>There is a number of online “alternative lifestyle” movements that have been gaining steam among millennials. They are appealing in their leanness: do more with less. At first, they seem cute and liberating. Scores of Instagram influencers and bloggers romanticize these lifestyles, and their subreddits are buzzing with zealots. Key examples below:</p> <p><strong>FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</strong>: live frugally now to save money as quickly as possible, then buy a place in a low cost-of-living area and live (mostly) off your savings.</p> <p><strong>Van Life</strong>: Buy a van, trick it out with a beautiful bed and a kitchen. Live lightly, travel the world, work remotely.</p> <p><strong>Tiny Houses</strong>: Nobody needs 5,000 square feet. Why not play with constraints, and build a full house with the square feet of a studio?</p> <p><strong>Remote Work</strong>: work your high-paying-job from a low-cost-of-living area, save up money, and save on commuting.</p> <p>While these lifestyles are marketed as all about freedom, they come with major restrictions: they are overwhelmingly for the single and childless. Having children is very expensive, so it’s hard to make that work with FIRE. On the other hand, van life and tiny houses are logistically prohibitive to having children. By going down these routes, their adherents will delay having kids, likely by years. That’s usually a bad trade.</p> <p>Not only do these lifestyles constrain, they also reflect a severe already-existing capital constraint. Broadly, <em>all</em> of these movements are reactions to poverty. Living in a van, tiny house, or remotely all stem from one factor: real estate in your preferred area (perhaps the place you call “home”) is too expensive. You can’t afford to buy or rent a real place there, so you move into an Instagrammable shed, or you move away altogether. These lifestyles are solutions to problems of poverty – but in making those solutions fashionable, they hide the ugly reality underneath.</p> <p>Ultimately, these movements romanticize and hide the true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials#In_the_United_States">generational poverty of millennials</a>. This is a generation of people who will never retire, who may never even buy real estate of their own. In terms of intergenerational wealth, these people are screwed. And I would like to see that point raised and addressed, instead of making do with solutions of desperation.</p> <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<h2>ImageMagick Examples - Introductory Notes</h2>

<h3>What is ImageMagick?  A No-Holds-Barred Summary</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> is
designed for batch processing of images.  That is, it allow you to combine
image processing operations in a script (shell, DOS, Perl, PHP, etc.) so
the operations can be applied to many images, or as
a sub-system of some other tool, such as a Web application, video
processing tool, panorama generator, etc.  <i>It is not a GUI image
editor</i>. </p><p>

ImageMagick is, first of all, an image-to-image converter. That is what it was
originally designed to do.  That is, it will convert an image in just about
any image format (tell us if it can't) to any other image format.  </p><p>

But it is also a library of <i>image processing algorithms</i>.  These can be
access via the command line and shell/DOS scripts (which these example pages
demonstrate), or via a large number of programming languages, such as C, C++,
Perl, Ruby, PHP, etc.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/api.php">ImageMagick APIs</a>. </p><p>

Speed was never a major feature of IM, which places more emphasis on the
quality of the images it generates.  That is not to say that it can't
transform images in a reasonable amount of time. It's just not blindingly
fast.  Because of this, IM can be slow to perform certain processing
operations, especially when attempting to compress images into image formats
that have limited capabilities. </p><p>

ImageMagick concerns itself mainly with images in the form of a <i>rectangular
array of pixels</i>, commonly called a "raster."  It will handle "vector"
image formats like Postscript or PDF, but at the cost of converting those
images into a raster when loading them, and generating a vector image wrapper
around the raster when saving it.  As a result, vector images are often
processed badly when using the default settings.  However, specific options
can be used to improve this situation.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/formats/#vector">A word about vector image formats</a>.  </p>


<h3>About These Examples of ImageMagick Usage</h3><p>

These pages were developed from, and are a continuation of, my <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/info/graphics/imagemagick.hints">Collection of ImageMagick Hints and Tips</a> page I first started in 1993,
and placed on the new fangled world-wide-web making its appearance around the
same time.  Information on many aspects of IM, and notes not included in these
pages, are still present in that document.  However, while the present pages
were designed for you to look at, the hints and tips document was only for my
own edification.  So, it may be vague or chaotic in places.  You are welcome
to look at it, learn, and make comments on it.  </p><p>

Other examples were grabbed or developed from answers to users' questions on
he <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1">IM
Forums</a>, or contributed to me as solutions to various problems. </p><p>

I look forward to suggestions and e-mail from other IM users.  Such e-mail
generally results in improvements and expansions to these example pages.
</p>

<h3>Command Line Environments</h3><p>

All examples are written for use on UNIX, and specifically GNU/Linux systems,
using BASH scripting.  As a consequence, some examples use shell 'for-do'
loops. Most examples use a backslash '<code>\</code>' at the end of a line to
continue that command on the next line.  The longer commands are broken into
separate lines to try to further highlight the steps being applied. </p><p>

However, you can still use these examples from <b>PC Windows batch
scripts</b>, with some changes to the handling of certain characters.  With
some slight adaptation, the examples can also be run directly from
'<code>system</code>' calls in <b>PHP scripts</b>.  </p><p>

See <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/windows/">Windows Usage</a> and <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/api/index.html">APIs
and Scripting</a> for more information on using the ImageMagick commands in
these alternative environments. Contributions and test examples are welcome.
</p>


<h3>PerlMagick, and Other APIs</h3><p>

It should also be possible to adapt any of these examples to use the IM API
from languages such as Perl, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, and so on.  I recommend trying
things out on the command line first, until you get them right, and then
converting the operations to the specific API you are using. </p><p>

Although the situation has improved enormously with IM version 6, the command
line really only deals with a single image sequence at any one time. However,
APIs do not have this limitation, and allow you to manipulate multiple image
sequences, separately or together, to perform more complex operations.  This
ability makes it simpler to implement these examples using the IM API, and
removes the need to save images as temporary files, as many of the command
line examples require. When using an API, only permanent and semi-permanent
images need be saved to disk. </p><p>

Basically, let the example pages give you a start, to let you see what
is possible with ImageMagick.  Then, formulate what you want to do on
the command line, before coding the operations in scripts and API
code, where it is harder to make extensive changes. </p><p>

I also recommend that you comment your API code, <b>heavily</b>, adding the
command line equivalents to what you are trying to do, if possible. That way,
you can check and compare the results against those using the command line.
This lets you debug problems that you may come across later, especially as
improvements are made to image processing in the Core ImageMagick Library.
</p>

<h3>Downloading Input Images and Results</h3><p>

As much as possible, I try to use images built-into IM (such as
"<code>logo:</code>" or "<code>rose:</code>") as input images for IM example
commands, or to generate input images using IM commands.  I also often re-use
the output of previous commands in later examples.  Because of this, you
usually don't need to download any 'test' images in order to try out the
examples yourself. </p><p>

However, such generated or built-in images are not always convenient.  So,
when I do use an external image, I tend to re-use that input image, or the
results of previous examples, for later examples in that section. </p><p>

Sometimes the original source image will be displayed or for larger images
a link to the source image is provided. More commonly only the final resulting
image will be shown, as the input is well known or obvious. </p><p>

Almost all the IM example commands shown are executed in the same web
directory in which they appear.  That is, the command you see is the command
that was actually used to generate the image. Because of this you can modify
the page's URL to download or view the input image(s) used by an example.
Extra copies of the external source images have also been placed in the "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/">images</a>" and "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/">img_photos</a>"
sub-directories.  See also the example of a <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/INDEX.html">Fancy Photo Index</a> of those images. </p><p>


If text output or image information is produced by an example, it is saved to
a text file, and an image of it is generated for display on the Web page.
Selecting the text output image will link you to a copy of the actual text
output by the command.  </p><p>

In all these examples, selecting the output image should let you download the
image which was actually created by the example command. But be warned, not
all browsers understand all image formats used. </p>

<h3>External Image Sources</h3><p>

By the way, most of the source images used in these examples come from <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/">Anthony's Icon
Library</a>, particularly the  <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/desc/cl-bgnd/Icons.html">background tiles</a>, <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/large/Icons.html">large
clip-art</a>, and <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/dragons/Icons.html">dragons</a> sections of the library. (I like dragons!).  ASIDE: these pages
may be offline as the web site slowly moves to a new server.  </p><p>

This library actually predates the WWW. I created it in 1991, due to the lack
of good, clean iconic images for use on the X Window System.  The advent of
the WWW has of course changed this, but my original library still exists and
remains available as a source of images, even though it is not actively
growing.  </p><p>

Some specific images, and larger images, are contributed by the authors of
specific examples.  The authors of such examples are listed in the contributed
section, or at the bottom of the page. </p><p>

If you are looking for a specific image, I recommend using <a href="http://images.google.com/imghp">Google Image Search</a> (or similar) to
find something appropriate. You can, of course, convert or resize such images
using IM for your own purposes.  However, you should be careful about
copyright if you plan to use such images commercially. </p>


<h3>PNG Images on Web Pages</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>

In many examples, I use an image in PNG format, such as that shown to the
right of this text.  The PNG image format supports images with
semi-transparent pixels, a feature few other image formats provide.  It is
also a very well-understood image format and, as such, is usable by most of
today's image programs and Web browsers.  </p><p>

Some Web browsers, however, do NOT handle transparent PNG images correctly
(most notably Microsoft Internet Explorer v6).  Because of this, I generally
use the JPEG and GIF formats for images on the Web, and only use the PNG
format when generating images with semi-transparent pixels, or when exact
colors are needed for later examples. </p><p>

To allow IE v6 browsers to display PNG images, I use a special 'style sheet'
using complex JavaScript.  For information on this, see <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/wwwlab/pngtest/">PNG with
transparency for IE</a>. Technically, this is only problem with IE, not
ImageMagick. </p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>

<a name="display"></a>
<h3>Displaying Images on Your Screen</h3>

Display problems can also occur when displaying images on-screen.  Because of
this, I recommend using a command like the following to tile
a '<code>checkerboard</code>' pattern underneath the image, to highlight any
transparent or semi-transparent pixels in it.

<div><pre><code do_not_execute="">
    composite  -compose Dst_Over -tile pattern:checkerboard image.png x:
</code></pre></div>
</td><td>
   <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>

The image displayed in the above example is a special PNG-format <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png">test image</a>, which was generated using the shell
script "<code><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/scripts/generate_test">generate_test</a></code>".
Normally, the command would output the results to your display, not onto a Web
page like this.  </p><p>

If you look carefully, you can see the checkerboard pattern though the
semi-transparent colors. However, the image, as a whole, is fully opaque.  So,
this technique should work on all displays, Web browsers, and image viewers.
</p><p>

As of IM v6.0.2, the "<code>display</code>" program performs something like
this automatically.  However, it does not seem to handle images using color
tables (i.e., GIF) in this way. Using the "<code>x:</code>" output image format
(as above) causes an …</p></div></div>
