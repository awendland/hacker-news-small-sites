                <p><strong>T</strong><span>here is no one in American government — or perhaps any government — quite like Dr. Anthony Fauci. His position, with its mixture of informal power and public visibility, scientific authority and beltway influence, is sui generis. Few other unconfirmed civil servants have access to as many rooms in the executive interagency; no public official commands as much respect in the world of science and medicine. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984, he has advised six presidents (and now a seventh) on domestic and global health issues — HIV/AIDS, SARS, Ebola, Zika, and MERS — and overseen decades of research on infectious disease, pandemics, and virology. Under his stewardship, NIAID’s mission has been reshaped around his personage: its priorities are </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> priorities, its research agenda is </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> research agenda. And that agenda has borne fruit: breakthrough treatments for HIV and other deadly diseases and now, a vaccine for Covid-19. As Stanford microbiologist David Relman told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April, “Tony has essentially become the embodiment of the biomedical and public-health research enterprise in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although Fauci has no statutory authority to preside over a public health crisis, he has become the nation’s de facto Doctor-in-Chief during this pandemic. His face — elven and expressive — is the face of the medical establishment’s response to the novel coronavirus. I doubt most Americans can name the (</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/20/biden-surgeon-general-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>outgoing</span></a><span>) U.S. Surgeon General, CDC Director, or Fauci’s nominal boss, the director of the National Institutes of Health (Jerome Adams, Robert Redfield, and Francis Collins, respectively), but everyone knows Dr. Fauci. His plaintive but never pessimistic patter and disarming outer-borough rasp are soothing sonic features of our daily dirge of death, doom, and statistics. I was relieved when I first saw Fauci on TV — sometime in March 2020 — thinking dimly to myself, for the millionth time, “Ah, an adult in the room.” Amid a ceaseless current of chaos and grief, Fauci’s egoless display of competence, his grandfatherly warmth and irony, were ports in a storm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But a comforting bedside manner has done little to mitigate catastrophe. Over 400,000 Americans are dead, twice as many as any other country. Infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are currently at record highs. And although we have a vaccine, the rollout has already been stymied by a dearth of resources and coordination. As one public health expert told <em>The </em></span><i><span>New York Times </span></i><span>on January 17</span><i><span>,</span></i><span> our pandemic response has been “a colossal failure at every level of government.” And herein lies a paradox. America is suffering from a disease outbreak whose morbid scope is the consequence of world-historic negligence. We are desperately and needlessly sick. And yet, the man known as “America’s Doctor,” the undisputed personification of public health research and pandemic preparedness, faces no reputational consequences. On the contrary, Dr. Fauci remains one of our most beloved public figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What explains this? Liberals, who otherwise harshly condemn the federal government’s pandemic response, are especially besotted with the diminutive virologist. For fans of the #Resistance, a well-timed </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dr-anthony-fauci-did-a-facepalm-during-trumps-coronavirus-briefing-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>facepalm</span></a><span> during one of the Mad King’s early soliloquies guaranteed Fauci’s place on a Mount Rushmore of replacement patriarchs, alongside James Comey and Robert Mueller. (Fauci later insisted the gesture was innocuous; he was merely obscuring his face to dislodge a lozenge from his throat.) Still, Democrats’ devotion has never waned. They see in Fauci a lonely champion of “truth” and “facts” in a White House otherwise hostile to “science.” Brad Pitt earned an Emmy nomination for portraying the 80-year-old physician on Saturday Night Live. One Hamilton-inspired TikTok (“My name is Dr. Anthony Fau-CHEE…”) went viral. Just since the beginning of the “third wave” of Covid infections in October, Fauci has received leadership awards from the National Academy of Medicine, the FBI Agents Association, the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, and the Boy Scouts of America. Joe Biden has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/anthony-fauci-biden-transition/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>asked</span></a><span> Fauci to stay on at NIAID and serve in his administration as a chief medical advisor. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proclaimed “Anthony S. Fauci Day” on December 24.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fauci’s celebrity, however, cannot obscure empirical reality. As America’s Doctor would surely agree, the numbers don’t lie: 2,824 Americans died of Covid-19 on Anthony S. Fauci Day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anthony Fauci is no doubt a dedicated public servant, respected by his colleagues, beloved by many Americans. But the puzzle remains: why has the man most closely associated with the public health response to the pandemic entirely avoided accountability for its failure?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>F</strong><span>irst, the most straightforward defense: it wasn’t his fault. He did the best he could, but Fauci’s better instincts were thwarted by Trump and his coterie of idiots. Of course, there’s truth in this. The uneasy peace between Trump and his medical advisors started to unravel almost before it began. By the end of March, Trump was sweating the stocks and tweeting that the “cure” must not be worse “than the problem itself.” He clashed with Fauci throughout the spring — over masks, hydroxychloroquine, school openings, and Easter. By summer, Trump was publicly lambasting the good doctor, leaking anti-Fauci talking points to the press and sidelining him in task force meetings, which were themselves increasingly rare. Scott Atlas, the libertarian radiologist and herd-immunity advocate whom Trump hired based on his Fox News appearances, was calling the shots.</span></p>
<p><span>But Fauci seldom contradicted the president’s lies outright, opting for tact and de-escalation instead. “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Fauci </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/dr-fauci-press-conference-white-house-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>said</span></a><span> in late March. “OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.” On July 4, Trump said 99 percent of Covid cases were “harmless.” Fauci characterized this as a misinterpretation. (“I’m trying to figure out where the president got that number…” he said.) Though Fauci has a reputation for bluntness, as the </span><i><span>Financial Times</span></i><span>’s Hannah Kuchler </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57834c2c-a078-4736-9173-8fb32cfbbf4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>observed</span></a><span>, “he clearly also tries to hold back, believing he will make a bigger difference to the course of the pandemic if he keeps his job.”</span></p>
<p><span>This logic pervades the most common defense of Fauci’s record. “Tony is unique, in that he has such credibility with politicians that he’s been able to insert hard facts into the conversation,” Nobel laureate biologist David Baltimore told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April. “That has been wonderful for our country and the world.” In this view, Fauci was </span><i><span>handling</span></i><span> Trump, just as he handled previous presidents, including a reluctant Ronald Reagan during the AIDS epidemic. When he pulls his punches, it’s always for the greater good; namely, the cause of remaining in the room. Stepping too far out of line, contradicting Trump with too much vigor, would have imperiled his standing. “The argument for Fauci saying more,” </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/16/anthony-fauci-built-truce-trump-is-destroying-it/?arc404=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>wrote</span></a><span> Molly Roberts in <em>The</em> </span><i><span>Washington Post</span></i><span>, “… is also an argument for self-exile.” And then what? Truth and facts would have had no advocate inside the White House. As Fauci himself </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/health/fauci-trump-covid.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> the </span><i><span>Times</span></i><span> on Sunday, “I felt that if I stepped down, that would leave a void. Someone’s got to not be afraid to speak out the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span>At a briefing in July, Trump </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/politics/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-approval-rating/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>mused</span></a><span>, “It’s interesting: [Fauci’s] got a very good approval rating. And I like that, it’s good. Because remember, he’s working for this administration. He’s working with us.” Winding his way to his point, Trump said, “So why don’t I have a high approval rating… with respect to the virus?” After a pause, he deadpanned, “It can only be my personality, that’s all.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As is often the case with Trump, he had a point, just not the one he meant. The liberal apologia for Fauci </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> internally contradictory. As one scientist said to me, “We can’t deify Fauci’s response to the pandemic as fantastic while simultaneously condemning Trump, when for months, the two were hand in hand.” Indeed, Fauci is only blameless if he was utterly powerless to stop the administration’s disastrous plans. And if he </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> powerless, he should’ve resigned and communicated the truth bluntly to the public long ago. Otherwise, he knowingly lent credibility to an abject failure he couldn’t control.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To put an even finer point on it, the precise conditions that would maximally exonerate Fauci — i.e., Trump is solely at fault; Fauci had no influence — are conditions under which Fauci </span><i><span>absolutely </span></i><span>should have bolted. The more aberrant Trump’s behavior, the more he diverged from the medically prudent course of action, the greater Fauci’s responsibility to leave and blow the whistle. If Fauci knew better but didn’t say, what use was he inside the room? If he </span><i><span>didn’t</span></i><span> know better, then he shares the blame.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In recent days, Fauci and Covid task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx — another veteran AIDS researcher who’s received slightly </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/biden-coronavirus-team-deborah-birx-437923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>less deferential</span></a><span> treatment from the media than her male counterpart — have undertaken a goodwill tour. Birx </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FaceTheNation/status/1353332977560735744?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> CBS that denialists in the White House “derailed” the pandemic response, putting out information she knew to be false. Fauci joked with Rachel Maddow that Trump had </span><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/fauci-to-maddow-i-ve-been-wanting-to-come-on-your-show-for-months-and-months-99905093921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>forbidden</span></a><span>&nbsp;him from coming on her show and </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/21/anthony-fauci-speaking-covid-liberating-under-biden-vs-trump/4244169001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> the White House press corps, “The idea that you can get up here and… let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling.” Meanwhile, liberal pundits like Ezra Klein have </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/opinion/biden-covid-19-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>praised</span></a><span> Biden’s “maddeningly obvious” Covid plans, describing their simplicity as a “damning indictment” of Trump’s negligence. But if Biden’s life-saving interventions are so straightforward and crucial, why weren’t Fauci and Birx loudly demanding them months ago?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“To keep their jobs” should not be a satisfying answer — not for the living or for the dead.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="content">
<p>Recently I have become curious about <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">the Gemini
Project</a> and the content that people have
made available to be retrieved over the gemini:// protocol.  I’m not convinced
by the arguments for not just using http, and mostly it’s just that I
typically find more things that I am interested in casually reading through on
people’s gemlogs than I would on, say, reddit, and similar aggregators.  But
presumably advocates of gemini:// and the text/gemini format would argue that
it’s various respects in which it differs from the web that makes geminispace
conducive to the production of the sort of content you find there.  So I’m
remaining open minded about the possibility that having a completely separate
protocol is important, and not just an annoyance because rss2email doesn’t
work and I had to spend time writing
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/gmi2email">gmi2email</a>.</p>

<p>I now have a games console at home for the first time in some years, which I
bought in response to the ongoing pandemic, and one thing that I have noticed
is that using it feels like being offline in a way that playing games on a
regular computer never would.  It has a WiFi connection but it doesn’t have a
web browser, and I am glad that using it provides an opportunity to be
disconnected from the usual streams of information.  And perhaps something
similar ought to be said in favour of how the Gemini project does not just use
http.  There is, perhaps, a positive psychological effect induced by making
the boundary between text/gemini and the web as hard as it is made by using
gemini:// rather than http.</p>

<p>Something about which I find myself much more sceptical is how the
specification for gemini:// and text/gemini is not extensible.  Advocates of
Gemini have this idea that they can’t include, say, a version number in the
protocol, because the extensibility of the web is what has led to the problems
they think it has, so they want to make it impossible.  Now on the one hand
perhaps the people behind Gemini are in the best position that anyone is in to
come up with a spec which they will finalise and render effectively
unchangeable, because a lot of them have been using Gopher for decades, and so
they have enough experience to be able to say exactly what Gopher is missing,
and be confident that they’ve not missed anything.  But on the other hand,
Gemini is one technological piece in attempts to make a version of the
Internet which is healthier for humans – the so-called “small Internet”
movement – and maybe there will be new ideas about how the small Internet
should be which would benefit from a new version of the Gemini specification.
So it seems risky to lock-in to one version.</p>

<center><b>Counterfeiting Stock 2.0</b></center>

<p>
Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.
</p>
<p>
<span>Why is This Important?</span> This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.
</p>
<p>
The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.
</p>
<p>
The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed—the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span>A Glossary of Illogical Terms</span> — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Broker Dealer or Prime Broker</b> — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker.
</li>
<li><b>Hedge Funds</b> — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.
</li>
<li><b>Market Maker</b> — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.
</li>
<li><b>Short Seller</b> — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.”
</li>
<li><b>The Securities and Exchange Commission</b> — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.
</li>
<li><b>Depository Trust Clearing Corp</b> — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.
</li>
<li><b>Short Sale</b> — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.
<p>This relatively simple process is perfectly legal—so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.
</p></li>
<li><b>Disclosed Short</b> — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing. 
</li>
<li><b>Naked Short</b> — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud. 
<p>
Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.
</p></li>
<li><b>Fails–to–Deliver</b> — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.
<p>
Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).
</p></li>
<li><b>Options</b> — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). Options are an integral part of short manipulations, the result of SEC promulgated loopholes in Reg SHO. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.
</li>
<li><b>Naked call</b> — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list. A share of stock that has a naked call as its borrowed shares is marked as a disclosed short when it is sold, even though nobody in the transaction actually owns a share.

<p>In a previous <a href="https://onurgumus.github.io/2020/12/26/Functional-Programming.html">post</a> I have explained my motivations for functional programming.
It’s no secret I love F# because F# makes me sleep better. In this post, I would like to discuss some different aspects of F#.</p>

<h2 id="f-is-gaining-independence-from-net">F# is gaining independence from .NET</h2>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/platform.png" alt="F# platforms"></p>

<!--more-->

<p>F# is mostly known to the developer community as the small ignored brother of C# running on the .NET platform. However, what is less known about F# is that it
has come to a level to be .NET independent. Thanks to <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, today F# can be considered as a complete replacement of TypeScript. Yes,
people do write full-blown SPA, React, Svelte applications by using F# instead of TypeScript. If you think Fable is just a transpiler, think again:  https://github.com/kunjee17/awesome-fable . I would say Fable is on the way being an ecosystem by itself.</p>

<p>There is also a new prototype target for Fable that allows F# code to transpile to Python developed by Dag Brattli.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/python2.gif" alt="Python"></p>

<p>F# also works as on WebAssembly with <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a> which is still based on .NET. And not to forget another F# web platform called <a href="https://websharper.com/">WebSharper</a> from the same people who developed Bolero.</p>

<p>Just like JavaScript people were using NodeJs to bring the front-end devs to the backend zone, F# also can be used to bring the backend-devs to the front-end realm. I am a living example myself. By using F# in the font-end you can practically share the code between your .NET/Node backend and the browser, giving you an isomorphic development experience.</p>

<p>This somewhat puts F# in an interesting position as historically most dotnet has been languages are managed by Microsoft. But Fable simply liberates
F# from Microsoft and .NET.</p>

<h2 id="the-f-fanboys">The F# fanboys</h2>

<p>You might have heard “one of those guys” like me who is talking about how great functional programming and/or F# is. And from that point, it looks like below</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/music.png" alt="music"></p>

<p>I know it’s annoying, however, let’s look at it from the side and this is how an F# developer feels when he or she is suggesting you using F#:
<img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/wheel.png" alt="wheels"></p>

<h2 id="microsofts-and-communitys-stance">Microsoft’s and community’s stance</h2>

<p>From Microsoft’s point of view, F# is actively supported and maintained. There are Microsoft developers actively fixing things and adding new features however as a general Microsoft’s point of view .NET == C# and that is that. From .NET developer community’s
point of view, things are even worse. Since all Microsoft docs and tools geared towards C#, adding up unfamiliarity with the functional paradigm, most people follow C# way and completely ignore its little brother F#. I still think this is a missed 
opportunity for the .NET community. For example, let’s look at the excellent server side F# web framework <a href="https://giraffe.wiki/">Giraffe</a>. 
While C# and asp.net developers are busy memorizing the Microsoft way of handling requests, learning what attributes to decorate their
classes and members, the F# developers who use giraffe, simply rely on functional composition:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>route</span> <span>"/"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setHttpHeader</span> <span>"X-Foo"</span> <span>"Bar"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setStatusCode</span> <span>200</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setBodyFromString</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As HTTP processing is usually treated as a pipeline by itself on the server-side, it’s an excellent target for functional programming. Just like lego, plug-in your pipes, and you are good to go.</p>

<p>Furthermore, most developers worry about if they could find an F# job whereas companies who consider making the switch worry if they could find an F# developer.
As of today on linked in there are approximately 700 F# jobs and even most of these are not F# specific rather than they are like “C# or F# developers wanted”.</p>

<p>And most non-.NET people are not willing to touch anything related to Microsoft even with a 10 foot pole. (Of course, the major exceptions to this are TypeScript and Visual Studio Code which both are widely popular). The  Functional programmers’ camp also dismisses F# at sight blaming it’s not like Haskell as in for example F# does not support type classes.</p>

<h2 id="couple-of-unique-features-of-f">Couple of unique features of F#</h2>

<p>I am not going to talk about the features of F# but just wanted to highlight a couple of them.</p>

<p>The first one is the file order. Please look at the below photo:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/files.png" alt="file-order"></p>

<p>In F# the order of the files matter. It is somewhat a disliked feature by the newcomers, but it makes the dependencies immediately visible.
So the code in the top file has no dependency on any others below and the 2nd file from the top only depends on the first. When you open a project which you are not 
familiar, file ordering helps to find your way.</p>

<p>The second one is Type Providers:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/sqlprovider.gif" alt="type-providers"></p>

<p>Type providers are somewhat code generators but they do that non-intrusively. Very roughly similar to LISP style macros they expand at compile time. Type providers make it very easy to discover HTML or JSON documents read database rows, file system, and discover DDL and rows within the coding screen without leaving your editor. And everything becomes so type-safe.</p>

<h2 id="develop-fantastic-ui-apps-with-f-and-elmish">Develop fantastic UI apps with F# and Elmish</h2>

<p>Well they say seeing is believing, so let’s see how well F# handles UI development. While React devs on Facebook trying to solve the state problem over and over again by using hooks and perhaps new experimental
recoil and contexts IMHO, all are horrible options as they encourage rendering code inter-mix with business code reminding me asp.net web forms times where you could write your SQL statements right into the page itself.</p>

<p>F# developers have ported elm architecture to something called elmish and it flourished well among F# community.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of things you can do with Elmish as you can write your business code once and port it to any UI platform below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>React: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/react">Elmish React</a></li>
  <li>Windows Desktop: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF">Elmish WPF</a></li>
  <li>Gaming: <a href="https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/Xelmish">Xelmish</a></li>
  <li>Cross platform UI: <a href="https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Avalonia.FuncUI">Avalonia.FuncUI</a></li>
  <li>Mobile development: <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous">Fabulous</a></li>
  <li>Terminal: <a href="https://github.com/DieselMeister/Terminal.Gui.Elmish">Terminal.Gui.Elmish</a></li>
  <li>Web Assembly: <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They all share the same single architecture: Elmish. So you can write your code for one and port it to another.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-and-some-resources">Getting started and some resources</h2>

<p>If you want to get started to F#, the first place you should check out is <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F# Software Foundation</a></p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/fsf2.png" alt="fsharp-foundation"></p>

<p>As you can see FSharp Software Foundation offers mentorship programs periodically, which means you can have a free weekly 1 on 1 session with an experienced F# developer! As of today the program is open for people who want to have an F# mentor or want to be
an F# mentor. You can apply from <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKgZaAcjf7ZxVqBZzyZcBi609BOc0etBnV5XhR6BMihdyYRw/viewform">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are sold with F# there is one important point to highlight. Do not treat F#, just another language with different syntax especially if you are familiar
with Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, etc. You have to embrace functional programming as a paradigm. F# is a functional-first programming language. In other words,
although F# has OOP syntax as well, it mostly makes sense to use F# when you want to get benefit from functional programming concepts. If you try to program
F# the same way you program other imperative languages you won’t get much benefit.</p>

<p>If you are a C# develeoper and you want to start functional programming with F# this is the go-to book:
<em>Disclaimer: I do not know the author nor I am affiliated with the publisher by any way</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp">Functional programming in C#</a></p>

<p>Although the book is mostly about C#, it will show you how painful to do functional programming with C# and only perhaps then you can develop
some love for F#. Having that said it will also help you to understand some more new coming but confusing features of C# 9 like Records and Pattern matching.
If you think  C# records are for immutability, no they are not. They are for Value semantics and <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/what-is-referential-transparency/#:~:text=In%20functional%20programming%2C%20referential%20transparency,the%20result%20of%20the%20program.">referential transparency</a>.</p>

<p>To try F# right away you may use the following links:</p>

<p>https://try.fsharp.org/</p>

<p>https://fable.io/repl/</p>

<p>https://tryfsharp.fsbolero.io/</p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>When you are unfamiliar with F# syntax, it might look a bit cryptic. And I have seen some people complained that it is very verbose. On the contrary, I would make a bold claim that F# beats most other languages when it comes to conciseness. You don’t believe me? see it your self (make sure you check all implementations)</p>

<p><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:F_Sharp">F# problems on Rosetta Code</a></p>

<h2 id="a-couple-of-toy-projects-of-mine">A couple of toy projects of mine</h2>

<p>I have developed commercial applications with F#, but as public stuff here are a couple of projects I have built. One is a full blazor/web assembly project:</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/FBlazorShop</p>

<p>And the actual app for the 3D bin packing problem, in which items of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of a fixed given volume in a way that minimizes the number of bins used.</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/BinDrake</p>

<p>http://bindrake.com/</p>

<p>Trying and learning F# really requires you to dismiss your prejudices and be patient. But in the end, once you master the functional paradigm,
it makes you sleep better as a developer.</p>

<p>Hey, folks. Sorry it's been a while, but it's been a busy time. Let's start with the bad news first.</p>

<h2>Bad news</h2>

<p>As you know, SuperDuper 3.3.1 cannot copy a volume with Big Sur on it. We're currently blocked on some issues I don't have direct control over, and as such I don't have a new version for you that <strong>fully</strong> supports Big Sur, nor a timeframe for when that will be released.</p>

<p>Right now, as many of you know, v3.3.1 <strong>will</strong> work with non-boot volumes, but it <strong>won't</strong> work with volumes that have macOS on them, because it will try to do some of the things that no longer work in macOS 11.</p>

<p>I know that's been a disappointment, but that's where we are with v3.3.1.</p>

<h2>Good news!</h2>

<p>However, after wracking my brain for <strong>far</strong> too long, I've come up with a <strong>workaround</strong> that will let you make the backups you need to save your files, and to supplement your Time Machine backup. And for that, we need to go Back...to the Future!</p>

<h2>Huh?</h2>

<p>Let me try to explain.</p>

<p>In Catalina, as I explain in <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/breaking_the_tape/">Breaking the Tape</a>, Apple split the startup volume into two parts: the System volume and the Data volume. We did a ton of work that year to support this new setup in a way that was transparent to the user; SuperDuper automatically creates the proper volumes, converts the drives to APFS as needed, etc.</p>

<p>Worked great.</p>

<p>In macOS 10.15.5, though, <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/black_boxes_and_bugs/">Apple broke 3rd party copy tools</a> in a way that couldn't be worked around without the use of <code>asr</code>, a low-level drive copy tool that has its own issues. They fixed that in 10.15.6...but it was a rather ominous sign for the future.</p>

<p>That ominous sign became terrifying reality in macOS 11. Due to the new Sealed System Volume, use of <code>asr</code> became mandatory if you wanted to make a copy that was bootable. And even <strong>that</strong> didn't work <strong>at all</strong> until <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/big_sur/">November 5th</a> of last year—just before Big Sur's official release.</p>

<p>Even now, as of the time of this writing, <code>asr</code> won't make a bootable copy of an M1-based Mac.</p>

<p>So, as of Big Sur, 3rd party tools like SuperDuper can no longer make bootable copies on their own. For that, it's <code>asr</code> or nothing.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2007/06/13/a-very-sweet-solution/">a <em>very</em> <strong>sweet solution</strong></a>.</p>

<p>But, 3.3.1 doesn't know that. It tries to do all the special stuff that we had to do for Catalina, and those things no longer work. And so, as you've seen, that copy generates errors or seems to hang right at the start (because it's thrown exceptions that stop the copy).</p>

<h2>Didn't You Say "Good News"?</h2>

<p>I'm getting there.</p>

<p>SuperDuper! 3.3.1's magic was all about dealing with the split startup volume. It built on the APFS support and scheduling fixes we put into the previous version...and added new things for compatibility with Catalina.</p>

<p>But...what if it <strong>didn't</strong> do that? What if SuperDuper was...<strong>stupider</strong>?</p>

<h2>Wonderfully Awful</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oUUdW2bTa3Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I've been testing this out for a while in-house. and I've come up with a weird-sounding workaround that...works!</p>

<p>Basically, you can use SuperDuper to copy the Data volume of the volume group. The result contains all <strong>your</strong> data and applications, can be restored in a few different ways...and can even be made bootable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that, as I indicated above, M1 Macs <strong>can't readily boot from external drives</strong>. There are things you can do, if you have an external Thunderbolt 3 drive (USB-C isn't sufficient), but even that won't work if the internal drive is dead. Unless things change, bootable backups are basically a thing of the past on M1-based Macs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>It's actually easy. To accomplish this, use an old version of SuperDuper—<a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/downloads/SuperDuper!+3.2.5.dmg">specifically, v3.2.5</a>—to copy the Data volume, which is shown in the older version!</p>

<p>v3.2.5 is well tested, having been on the market for quite some time, and is reliable. So we don't have to worry about doing a broad beta test of a partially complete new release. It's already tested, and I've been busy doing the additional testing necessary to prove it works on Big Sur.</p>

<p>Again, this will make a copy of the data that you need to preserve <strong>your</strong> stuff, both Applications and Data, while leaving the Sealed System Volume alone.</p>

<p>And it's a valid source for "restore" during a clean install or migration! So restoration is <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>fast</strong> should it become necessary.</p>

<h2>Neat!</h2>

<p>Yeah, I wish I had thought of this earlier.</p>

<p>So, if you're on Big Sur, and you want to copy a startup drive, here's what to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have your license information handy. You can retrieve it from SuperDuper's Register... page should you need to.</li>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/downloads/SuperDuper!+3.2.5.dmg">SuperDuper! v3.2.5 from here</a>.</li>
<li>Remove SuperDuper! from the Security &amp; Privacy preference pane and restart your Mac. This is important, and works around an Apple bug triggered by the change of SuperDuper!'s bundle ID.</li>
<li>Run SuperDuper and follow the steps to add it back into Security &amp; Privacy.</li>
<li>If your license is missing, re-enter it from your license email. </li>
<li>Turn off "Check for Updates" in our Preferences so we don't nag you about v3.3.1.</li>
<li>Select the "Data" volume in the source pop-up, and a <strong>new</strong> APFS backup volume in the destination pop-up, along with "Backup - all files" (or whatever script you want).
&gt; If you already have a backup volume, you can use Disk Utility to delete <strong>just</strong> the System volume, rather than create a new one. After doing this, you may need to repair it with Disk First Aid before it will show up in SuperDuper.</li>
<li>Make your copy as normal, set up your schedule as needed, etc. Your regular Smart Updates will work as expected.</li>
</ol>

<p>To fully restore, it's easiest to boot to recovery, erase the internal drive you want to restore to, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904">reinstall the OS from Recovery mode</a>, and then, when prompted to restore during the first boot of the fresh copy of macOS, point at the backup. All your data and applications will be brought in automatically.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to make the backup bootable and have an Intel Mac, boot to Recovery (Cmd+R during power on) and install Big Sur to the backup drive. You can then start up from the backup. Note, though, that once made bootable, you can no longer copy <strong>to</strong> the backup until you delete the system volume as above. So <strong>don't</strong> do this unless you need to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Forward-Looking Statements</h2>

<p>It seems clear that the future of bootable backups is unclear.</p>

<p>M1 Macs <strong>can't</strong> be copied in a way that makes them bootable. Bare metal recovery on an M1 Mac isn't possible, since they depend on the contents of their internal drive even when booting externally. And the tools required to make bootable copies of Intel Macs are limited, often fail, and produce inscrutable and undocumented diagnostics when they do.</p>

<p>Everything's a tradeoff, and with the M1 Macs, Apple has given us an amazing new platform, while taking away some of the things that made macOS such a joy to work with. And one of those things is bootable backups.</p>

<p>I have <strong>no idea</strong> if this is going to change for the better in whatever the next macOS version brings, and have no insight into Apple's future plans.</p>

<p>But I <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/practices_make_perfect_backups/">continue to advise multiple backup strategies</a>, including Time Machine (to an APFS volume under Big Sur), SuperDuper! (for a simple copy of your data and applications) and an online backup program (as a last resort).</p>

<p>With that, back to plugging away at a new version.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and for using SuperDuper.</p>

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>WhatsApp wasn’t the first instant messenger of its kind, and probably won’t be the last. I simply chose to focus on WhatsApp since its recent privacy issues have made it a hot topic.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform many regions. I’m stunned at its ubiquity every time I visit my extended family in India; I’m frequently greeted by looks of confusion when I remind them that I don’t use WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>

	<img width="600" src="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.png" alt="WhatsApp ad describing data not collected">
</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially …</p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>As someone who frequents the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php">PHP tag on StackOverflow</a> I pretty often see questions about how to parse some
particular aspect of HTML using regular expressions. A common reply to such a question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot parse HTML with regular expressions, because HTML isn’t regular. Use an XML parser instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement - in the context of the question - is somewhere between very misleading and outright wrong. What I’ll try
to demonstrate in this article is how powerful modern regular expressions <em>really</em> are.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-regular-actually-mean">What does “regular” actually mean?</h2>

<p>In the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">formal language theory</a>, something is called “regular” when it has a grammar where all production
rules have one of the following forms:</p>



<p>You can read those <code>-&gt;</code> rules as “The left hand side can be replaced with the right hand side”. So the first rule would
be “B can be replaced with a”, the second one “B can be replaced with aC” and the third one “B can be replaced with the
empty string” (<code>ε</code> is the symbol for the empty string).</p>

<p>So what are <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>a</code>? By convention, uppercase characters denote so called “non-terminals” - symbols which <em>can</em>
be broken down further - and lowercase characters denote “terminals” - symbols which <em>cannot</em> be broken down any
further.</p>

<p>All that probably sounds a bit abstract, so let’s look at an example: Defining the natural numbers as a grammar.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>N -&gt; 0
N -&gt; 1
N -&gt; 2
N -&gt; 3
N -&gt; 4
N -&gt; 5
N -&gt; 6
N -&gt; 7
N -&gt; 8
N -&gt; 9
N -&gt; 0N
N -&gt; 1N
N -&gt; 2N
N -&gt; 3N
N -&gt; 4N
N -&gt; 5N
N -&gt; 6N
N -&gt; 7N
N -&gt; 8N
N -&gt; 9N
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What this grammar says is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A natural number (N) is
... one of the digits 0 to 9
or
... one of the digits 0 to 9 followed by another natural number (N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example the digits 0 to 9 would be terminals (as they can’t be broken down any further) and <code>N</code> would be the
only non-terminal (as it can be and is broken down further).</p>

<p>If you have another look at the rules and compare them to the definition of a regular grammar from above, you’ll see
that they meet the criteria: The first ten rules are of the form <code>B -&gt; a</code> and the second ten rules follow the form
<code>B -&gt; aC</code>. Thus the grammar defining the natural numbers is <em>regular</em>.</p>

<p>Another thing you might notice is that even though the above grammar defines such a simple thing, it is already quite
bloated. Wouldn’t it be better if we could express the same concept in a more concise manner?</p>

<p>And that’s where regular expressions come in: The above grammar is equivalent to the regex <code>[0-9]+</code> (which is a hell lot
simpler). And this kind of transformation can be done with <em>any</em> regular grammar: Every regular grammar has a
corresponding regular expression which defines all its valid strings.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-regular-expressions-match">What can regular expressions match?</h2>

<p>Thus the question arises: Can regular expressions match only regular grammars, or can they also match more? The answer
to this is both yes <em>and</em> no:</p>

<p>Regular expressions in the formal grammar sense can (pretty much by definition) only parse regular grammars and nothing
more.</p>

<p>But when programmers talk about “regular expressions” they aren’t talking about formal grammars. They are talking about
the regular expression <em>derivative</em> which their language implements. And those regex implementations are only very
slightly related to the original notion of regularity.</p>

<p>Any modern regex flavor can match a <em>lot</em> more than just regular languages. How much exactly, that’s what the rest of
the article is about.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, I’ll focus on the PCRE regex implementation in the following, simply because I know it best (as
it’s used by PHP). Most other regex implementations are quite similar though, so most stuff should apply to them too.</p>

<h2 id="the-language-hierarchy">The language hierarchy</h2>

<p>In order to analyze what regular expressions can and cannot match, we first have to look at what other types of
languages there are. A good starting point for this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">Chomsky hierarchy</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Chomsky hierarchy:

<p>As you can see the Chomsky hierarchy divides formal languages into four types:</p>

<p>Regular languages (Type 3) are the least-powerful, followed by the context-free languages (Type 2), the
context-sensitive languages (Type 1) and at last the all-mighty recursively enumerable languages (Type 0).</p>

<p>The Chomsky hierarchy is a containment hierarchy, so the smaller boxes in the above image are fully contained in the
larger boxes. For example every regular language is also a context-free language (but <em>not</em> the other way around!)</p>

<p>So, let’s move one step up in that hierarchy: We already know that regular expressions can match any regular language.
But can they also match context-free languages?</p>

<p>(Reminder: When I say “regular expression” here I obviously mean it in the programmer sense, not the formal language
theory sense.)</p>

<h2 id="matching-context-free-languages">Matching context-free languages</h2>

<p>The answer to this is <em>yes</em>, they can!</p>

<p>Let’s take the classical example of a context-free language, namely <code>{a^n b^n, n&gt;0}</code>, which means “A number of <code>a</code>
characters followed by the <em>same</em> number of <code>b</code> characters”. The (PCRE) regex for this language is:</p>



<p>The regular expression is very simple: <code>(?1)</code> is a reference to the first subpattern, namely <code>(a(?1)?b)</code>. So basically
you could replace the <code>(?1)</code> by that subpattern, thus forming a recursive dependency:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/^(a(?1)?b)$/
/^(a(a(?1)?b)?b)$/
/^(a(a(a(?1)?b)?b)?b)$/
/^(a(a(a(a(?1)?b)?b)?b)?b)$/
# and so on
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From the above expansions it should be clear that this expression can match any string with the same number of <code>a</code>s and
<code>b</code>s.</p>

<p>Thus regular expressions can match at least some non-regular, context-free grammars. But can they match all? To answer
that, we first have to look at how context-free grammars are defined.</p>

<p>In a context-free grammar all production rules take the following form:</p>



<p>Here <code>A</code> once again is a non-terminal symbol and <code>β</code> is an arbitrary string of terminals and non-terminals. Thus every
production rule of a context-free grammar has a non-terminal on the left hand side and an arbitrary symbol string on
the right hand side.</p>

<p>As an example, have a look at the following grammar:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function_declaration -&gt; T_FUNCTION is_ref T_STRING '(' parameter_list ')' '{' inner_statement_list '}'

is_ref -&gt; '&amp;'
is_ref -&gt; ε

parameter_list -&gt; non_empty_parameter_list
parameter_list -&gt; ε

non_empty_parameter_list -&gt; parameter
non_empty_parameter_list -&gt; non_empty_parameter_list ',' parameter

// ... ... ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What you see there is an excerpt from the PHP grammar (just a few sample rules). The syntax is slightly different from
what we used before, but should be easy to understand. One aspect worth mentioning is that the uppercase <code>T_SOMETHING</code>
names here also are terminal symbols. These symbols which are usually called <em>tokens</em> encode more abstract concepts.
E.g. <code>T_FUNCTION</code> represents the <code>function</code> keyword and <code>T_STRING</code> is a label token (like <code>getUserById</code> or
<code>some_other_name</code>).</p>

<p>I’m using this example to show one thing: Context-free grammars are already powerful enough to encode quite complex
languages. That’s why pretty much all programming languages have a context-free grammar. In particular this also
includes well-formed HTML.</p>

<p>Now, back to the actual question: Can regular expressions match all context-free grammars? Once again, the answer is
<em>yes</em>!</p>

<p>This is pretty easy to prove as regular expressions (at least PCRE and similar) provide a syntax very similar to the
above for constructing grammars:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/

Google banned Element late Friday night, a ban thatÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355465650114846720">Element said</a> "is due to abusive content somewhere on Matrix." Matrix has millions of users, and as a federated chat protocol, Element does not control the content on Matrix, so this is a bit like banning a Web browser for displaying Web content. Element says it is working with Google to "explain how Element works and get the situation resolved."</p>
<p>Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/google-bans-parler-from-android-app-store/">been cracking down</a> on apps that display hateful content, but Element says that it shouldn't be part of the crackdown. "We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce," Element said. "We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content."</p>
<p>Element says it has a full-time team dedicated to handling abuse reports.</p>
<p>Element (which was formerly called Riot.im) is <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now">often cited</a> as one of the best Matrix clients. It looks a lot likeâ€”and is actually <a href="https://element.io/blog/slack-bridging/">interoperable with</a>â€”Slack and Discord. Element says it is used by "the French, German, UK and US governments, countless universities, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world." The app has recently seen <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">an influx of new users</a> after WhatsApp's announcement about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/">Facebook data sharing</a>, so maybe that triggered deeper scrutiny from Google. At press time, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=matrix%20chat&amp;c=apps">many other Matrix apps</a>â€”which by definition show the same content as Elementâ€”are still active on the Play Store.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Google takes a 30 percent cut of all Play Store transactions, which is supposed to pay for the cost of running the Store, but the company doesn't hire humans to primarily review apps the way Apple does, choosing instead to let the bots handle it. Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/apple-lowers-its-cut-of-app-store-revenues-for-some-developers/">recently cut</a> its App Store tax from 30 percent to 15 percent, so Apple actually charges developers less than Google while also offering better human support.
</p><p>Element's <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355595359582638080">latest update</a> on the situation as of this writing said it has been waiting more than eight hours for an email response. Element says it was not notified of the takedown, which has now passed the 24-hour mark.</p>
<p>The bots' interpretation of Google's rules often make no sense, and as a result Google regularly bans random small apps from the Play Store because they can display content from the Internet. We've seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/96kpsf/more_issues_with_google_play_suspended_for_hate/">Reddit apps,</a> <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/19/podcast-addict-pulled-play-store-allegedly-violating-coronavirus-policy/">podcast apps</a>, and other apps that display third-party Web content all "win" the Google Play ban-of-the-week lottery, just because they can be made to display third-party content. The same is true of Google Search, Chrome, Gmail, all of Google's chat apps, YouTube, Google Drive, and Google Podcasts, but those apps never get banned. Earlier this week Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/googles-bots-decide-ass-subtitle-support-is-too-risque-for-the-play-store/">banned a video app</a> because it listed support for the standard ".ass" subtitle filetype in its description.</p>
<p>The one benefit of the Play Store is that you don't have to use it, since Android supports sideloading. Element is also up <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">on F-Droid</a>, an all-open source repository of Android apps, though the version offered there is a month out of date. A more up-to-date version is on <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/vector-creations-limited/riot-im-communicate-your-way/riot-im-communicate-your-way-1-0-14-release/">APKmirror</a>, the Android hacking community's biggest app store.</p>
<p>These bans are almost always temporary mistakes that are rectified after a few hours or days, but that gives little solace to app developers who can suddenly have their businesses ripped out from under them because of an enforcement mistake. Element says, "we can only apologize for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this."</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Element got in touch with a person at Google and says the app should be back up soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update: we just got a call from a Google VP who explained the suspension was triggered by a report of extremely abusive content accessible on the <a href="https://t.co/g01j4u6O2e">https://t.co/g01j4u6O2e</a> server. Our trust &amp; safety team had already acted on it, and the app should be reinstated shortly.</p>

        <h2 id="github-should-start-an-app-store">GitHub Should Start An App Store</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Google suspended Elements - matrix chat app - from play store <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25965443">without any reasonable explanation</a>. I think this was an automated removal triggered by user reports or some other factors. The matrix team tried to reach out to them for explanation to no avail. We have seen this pattern in many cases now. Either it’s getting overwhelming for Google to monitor apps in its store or they don’t want apps like Elements which is decentralized to be on their store. The later mostly seems like a conspiracy theory and I think former is more true. In any case, it doesn’t make any sense for a single entity to govern what gets installed and not on billions of devices. A decentralized app store whould be best to fight this sort of suspensions but it’s far from reality at the moment. The alternative? GitHub App Store.</p>
<h3 id="but-why-github">But Why GitHub?</h3>
<p>Few reasons why I think GitHub is our best bet:</p>
<ol>
<li>They already host source code of millions of apps. Release integration should be trivial to implement.</li>
<li>Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">youtube-dl</a> debacle.</li>
<li>Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.</li>
<li>They could finally give the desktop the app store it deserves</li>
<li>This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.</li>
</ol>
<p>They will have to create app store applications for major platforms along with provision to host closed source applications on their store and they should be good to go. Honestly I can not imagine any other player being more successful in app stores than GitHub.</p>

        <p>There's been enough time for the dust to settle and for Robinhood's actual reason for halting trades to come out. But the question of why only buys and not sells has not really been answered in detail, and that's mainly because it's a pain-in-the-ass and delves deep into how the deposit requirements are calculated by the DTCC for brokers. </p>
<h2>First, what happened</h2>
<p>On that fateful day, Gamestop stock had massive volatility, and given the cries of "Buy!" and "Hold!" from /r/WSBs, I'd assume on Robinhood, a broker targeted at retail investors, it'd be heavily imbalanced towards buy trades.</p>
<p>As volatility increased, the DTCC (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation) increased the deposit requirements for brokers. Basically, when you submit a trade on a broker, the exchange of money for stock doesn't actually happen until 2 days later, and the firm that handles that exchange is called a clearing firm. Before then, Robinhood just sends records: John bought 2 GME for $600, Mary sold 1 GME for $290. If that's all that happened that day, then Robinhood would need to provide $310 dollars to the clearing firm, and receive 1 stock.</p>
<p>That's a credit risk - what if Robinhood doesn't have the money on settlement? The clearing firm would be on the hook. So the DTCC requires that brokers put up a deposit beforehand. On that day, the DTCC massively increased the deposit requirements for brokers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spokesman for the DTCC wouldn’t specify how much it required from specific firms but said that by the end of the day industrywide collateral requirements jumped to $33.5 billion, up from $26 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop">Levine</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount required by clearinghouses to cover the settlement period of some securities rose tremendously this week. How much? To put it in perspective, this week alone, our clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities increased ten-fold. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week">Robinhood</a></p>
<p>So, Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. And they quickly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/robinhood-gamestop-reddit/index.html">scrounged up some capital</a> so they could continue on Friday.</p>
<h3>Robinhood's Clearing Firm</h3>
<p>Robinhood actually has their own clearing firm, Robinhood Securities... for some reason, but it's still a DTCC member and must listen to what the SEC regulates. </p>
<h3>update 12:32 - On margin?</h3>
<p>Some people seem to be mistaking the situation. It is not about margin accounts - while yes, Robinhood "instant transfers" provides the illusion of being instant effectively with margin, it's not really the issue here.</p>
<p>Brokers cannot use client money to satisfy their clearing fund obligation.  So whether or not the accounts had a settled balance didn't matter - as you can see from the other brokers which halted buys and did not have "instant transfers".</p>
<p>Again, this is about what's effectively <em>collateral</em> the brokers must put up so that all parties can mitigate the risk of a broker failing. Of course client money is used when the transaction <em>settles</em>, but, naturally, you can't use their money, which isn't yours, as collateral.</p>
<h2>But why ONLY Buys?</h2>
<p>The deposit requirement is </p>
<p><code>deposit = min( 99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure, Deposit Floor Calc) + Mark-to-Market</code></p>
<p>And the variable to look at is the 99% 2d VaR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The volatility component is designed to capture the market price risk associated with each Member’s portfolio at a 99th percentile level of confidence. The VaR Charge is the volatility component applicable to most Net Unsettled Positions, and usually comprises the largest portion of a Member’s Required Deposit. Procedure XV of the Rules currently provides that the VaR Charge shall be calculated in accordance with a generally accepted portfolio volatility margin model utilizing assumptions based on reasonable historical data and an appropriate volatility range. As such, NSCC currently calculates a Member’s VaR Charge utilizing the VaR model, which incorporates an EWMA volatility
estimation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2018/34-82631.pdf">SEC</a></p>
<p>Remember when I subtracted John's buys of $600 with Mary's sell of $290 to get $310? That's the broker's net unsettled cash positions. The 99% VaR is basically, "99% of the time the broker's net unsettled will not be higher than X". You might remember if you took statistics about confidence intervals; this is the upper 99% confidence interval.</p>
<h3>Bad Desmos Graphs</h3>
<p>So, let's model our risk as a Normal curve, for simplicity's sake. Here I've graphed a normal distribution with a line representing the 95% percentile</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Y axis is probability, the X axis is Robinhood's net unsettled positions. The more positive, the more money they'd owe theoretically.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if more people buy than sell? Then it'd shift over to the right</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r2" alt=""></p>
<p>Hasn't the 95% percentile moved rightward as well? Now, what happens if the market is super volatile (i.e, the std dev of the distribution increases)</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r3" alt=""></p>
<p>Wow, now it's even more to the right! </p>
<p>As you can see, <strong>buys make this worse</strong>, <strong>sells make it better</strong>. Robinhood <em>could not</em> execute buys, because it would increase the deposits they'd need, which they legally must obligate by.  Sells, on the other hand, do not have this problem. They would not push the 95% boundary more to the right.</p>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>So really, it's not a bad decision or good decision that Robinhood halted buys of GME - it wasn't a decision, and it wasn't something they alone did.</p>
<p>These brokers halted buys of GME</p>
<ul>
<li>Robinhood</li>
<li>Webull</li>
<li>M1 Finance</li>
<li>Public</li>
<li>E-Trade</li>
</ul>
<p>While others only halted options</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive</li>
<li>TDA</li>
<li>Schwab</li>
<li>Tradeing212</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm, see a pattern? The former group includes companies like Robinhood (2013), WeBull (2017), M1 Finance (2015), while the latter has TDA (1975), Schwab(1971), Trading212 (2004).</p>
<p>(Okay, E-Trade is actually old too, but I guess they're just cash-strapped right now?)</p>
<p>Looks like young brokers with a limited capital resources to me.</p>
<h2>Stay or Switch?</h2>
<p>If there's something to fault Robinhood, it's that they're a young, janky broker (and also you might be getting screwed on the spread by Citadel). If they had more money on-hand they might not have had to stop buys of Gamestop. Perhaps they should have expected this and raised more capital earlier. </p>
<p>And that's a real reason to stay away from Robinhood. But for the love of god do not swap to WeBull or something if that's your concern.</p>
<p>And don't do it because you're abhorred by Robinhood's class warfare or something. Because that didn't happen - it was a mixture of SEC regulations and a cash-strapped startup (well, cash-strapped on big broker scales).</p>
<p>Although if you want to get mad at Hedge Funds anyway, feel free! You should always be mad at Hedge Funds. But please pick a real reason - you have no lack of choice to pick from.</p>

          <section><p>Online retailers know a lot about how their customers are navigating their virtual stores. Offline retailers are not so&nbsp;lucky.</p>
<p>Together with consumer behavior experts <a href="https://b-clarity.com/case/100-000-human-interactions-cant-be-wrong-touch-increases-sales/" target="_blank">B:Clarity</a> and a multinational home appliance brand we built a system to help understand customer movement and&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>The system consists of wireless sensors that are installed in electronics stores. A few hundred sensors in each&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>There are two types of&nbsp;sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vibration sensors. That trigger when someone is trying out a&nbsp;product.</li>
<li>Light sensors. Trigger when someone is standing in front of a&nbsp;product.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these sensors, we can see what items are most popular, how it correlates to sales data – and how to take action to improve&nbsp;sales.</p>
<p>But without collecting any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" target="_blank">personally identifiable information</a>.</p>
<p>This is what the sensors look&nbsp;like:</p>
<div>

<h2 id="why-monitor-shoppers-">Why monitor&nbsp;shoppers?</h2>
<p>Online retailers and e-commerce has many ways to gain insight into their customers. Examples include seeing the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items</a>, and the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches-with-no-results" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items with no results</a>.</p>
<p>Physical retailers don’t want to be left&nbsp;behind.</p>
<p>So many different ways to monitor shoppers in physical stores have been&nbsp;developed.</p>
<p>Amazon Go stores extensively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/" target="_blank">use cameras</a> to track everything that happens inside their&nbsp;stores.</p>
<p>Many stores provide free WiFi so that they can <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/wi-fi-tracking-a-data-gold-mine-or-privacy-nightmare/572937/" target="_blank">track their customers</a>.</p>
<p>All these solutions have a big problem:&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>Cameras see everything – much more than they need. And this data is collected and stored. Free WiFi hotspots may capture all kinds of&nbsp;traffic.</p>
<p>This is an obvious privacy problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>But it is not just a problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>It also creates a major problem for the companies storing the data: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/silicon-valley-terrified-california-privacy-law/" target="_blank">personally identifiable data is a liability</a>.</p>
<p>This is why we chose vibration sensors and light sensors. No liability from owning any personally identifiable&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>With only vibration and light, there simply is nothing there to identify individual&nbsp;shoppers.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-shopper-behavior">Understanding shopper&nbsp;behavior</h2>
<p>As a shopper, you want to find the best products, and – ideally – pay the lowest possible&nbsp;price.</p>
<p>The retailers and producers have slightly different&nbsp;motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands want customer to buy their products, and not their&nbsp;competitors’</li>
<li>Retailers want to sell more&nbsp;products</li>
</ul>
<p>And when the motivations of shoppers, retailers, and brands align, business is made. And the more business, the better for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Understanding customer behavior is key to improving the experience for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>The sensors detect when people are looking at items. And they report this immediately, so that we can see in real-time where shoppers&nbsp;are.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-a-wireless-iot-mesh-network-">Why use a wireless IoT mesh&nbsp;network?</h2>
<p>A wireless mesh network is a wireless network that automatically extend its&nbsp;range.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh network solution uses so-called <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/what-is-subghz-networking/" target="_blank">sub-GHz wireless technology</a> that has way better range than traditional WiFi or&nbsp;Bluetooth.</p>
<p>But even with a longer range, it is not always&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Electronics stores can be very large. And there is plenty of metal inside them that hampers the wireless&nbsp;coverage.</p>
<p>A mesh network is the ideal technology in these&nbsp;situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Coverage</strong>. Electronics stores can be huge. With a mesh network, we can cover it&nbsp;all.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>It just works</strong>. No network planning is&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to install</strong>. Just put each device where it should&nbsp;be.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to maintain</strong>. If there are issues with coverage, just add extenders as&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Robustness</strong>. If something changes, the network will automatically adapt and&nbsp;overcome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the wireless mesh network typically looks&nbsp;like:</p>

<div data-layout="grid" data-controls="#filterControls" data-animation="quicksand" data-x-gap="32" data-y-gap="32" data-media-queries="[

]">
<div>
<p><small>
The IoT mesh network uses range extenders to cover the entire area of the electronics store.

</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this deployment, the mesh network used one access point and two extenders. Most device are able to reach the access point directly, but some chose to talk to one of the&nbsp;extenders.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery&nbsp;life</h2>
<p>The sensors are equipped with batteries: one coin-cell battery&nbsp;each.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh system is <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/sensortag-power/" target="_blank">tailored for extreme low-power operation</a>. Extreme low-power operation in this case means that the sensors can go for several months one a single&nbsp;charge.</p>
<p>For example, the sensors are automatically turned off at night, to conserve their precious&nbsp;power.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the Thingsquare system continuously collects power consumption data from each and every&nbsp;sensor.</p>
<p>This data lets us see the exact behavior at any given time: are there any sensors that behave in a way that require their batteries to be replaced earlier? The Thingsquare system knows the answers to this, and alerts us if this would be the&nbsp;case.</p>

<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>
<p>The ioT mesh network is connected to the Internet via a 4G modem. The network maintains a stable encrypted connection to the backend system so that the devices always can be&nbsp;reached.</p>
<p>If the Internet connection would go down at any point during the deployment, the devices hold off from reporting their data until the Internet connection is&nbsp;restored.</p>
<p>With this technique, no data is ever&nbsp;lost.</p>

Broadly speaking, it is an attempt to give you an opportunity to take a look at Rome as it really was, by the eyes of humans who lived there in that time. Due to this, we are already paying much attention (and will proceed) to the level of details, adding realistic materials, colors, visual and weather effects. That’s why we are concentrating just on the center of the Rome for now, just to focus on quality and details.</p><p>Now we are planning to add a little additional territory (such as Circus Maximus, Velabrum area), and release our project as a 3d walkthrough application. I hope we will be able to complete it in a year approximately.</p> <img src="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg" data-src="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" data-srcset="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg 1600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-600x338.jpg 600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-400x225.jpg 400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" srcset="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg 1600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-600x338.jpg 600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-400x225.jpg 400w"><p>Boasting some impressive in-video lighting features, the animation focuses on the monumental scale that was flaunted by Rome during its apical architectural stage.

<p>First occurrence on <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Winter" title="Eth0:2010 Winter">eth0:2010 Winterlan</a>, the LackRack is the ultimate, low-cost, high shininess solution for your modular datacenter-in-the-living-room. Featuring the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270">LACK</a> (side table) from Ikea, the LackRack is an easy-to-implement, exact-fit datacenter building block.
It's a little known fact that we have seen Google engineers tinker with Lack tables since way back in 2009.
</p><p>The LackRack will certainly make its appearance again this summer at <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Summer" title="Eth0:2010 Summer">eth0:2010 Summer</a>.

Its low-cost and perfect fit are great for mounting up to 8 U of 19" hardware, such as switches (see below), or perhaps other 19" gear. It's very easy to assemble, and thanks to the design, they are stable enough to hold (for example) 19" switches and you can put your bottle of Club-Mate on top! Multi-shiny LackRack can also be painted to your specific preferences and the airflow is unprecedented!
</p>
<p>You can find a howto on buying a LackRack on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mrngm.com/eth0/LackRack/">this page</a>. This includes the proof that a 19" switch can indeed be placed in the LackRack in its natural habitat!

<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:5x_lackrack.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/9/99/5x_lackrack.jpg" decoding="async" width="250" height="250" data-file-width="800" data-file-height="800"></a></p><div><p>Illustration of the LackRack's modularity</p></div></div></div><p><i>For assembly in terms of a programming language, this is not the page you need.</i>
</p><p>However, in order to assemble the LackRack, there are a few prerequisites or tools that are needed:
</p>
<ul><li>1 (or more) LACK side table from Ikea</li>
<li>Screwdriver (whether muscle-driven or motor-driven, with preference of the latter)</li>
<li>Wood screws (they should fit in the rack mounts on your appliance, and not exceed 1" in length)</li>
<li>Spare time</li></ul>
<p>That's all! First, follow the assembly instructions in the Ikea manual in order to assemble the LACK.
After that, the installation of your 19" hardware can begin. When assembling a larger number of LACKs, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/IKEA_Hack_a_Lack/">this link</a> describes a useful tool for fitting the legs to the tabletop.
</p><p>The LackRack is a stackable modular product. Additional elements can be stacked on top easily. Brackets to secure the top element to the bottom one are not included but available from your local non-computer hardware store.
</p>
<ul><li>If you put several LackRacks side by side, the higher levels can be staggered to form a pyramid. This feature is not present in any other of the commercially available rack products.</li></ul>

<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lackrack2.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/7/76/Lackrack2.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="400" data-file-width="1536" data-file-height="2048"></a></p><div><p>Due to their light weight design, Lackracks will grow to any required size without compromise</p></div></div></div>
<p>Installing hardware in your LackRack is easy!
</p>
<ul><li><i>Optional but recommended</i> - Put the table on its side (which one is your decision) or upside down</li>
<li>Mount the hardware between the left and right leg
<ul><li>If you mount the first item, it is recommended to install it against the table top for good fit. This happens automatically if you have the LackRack upside down, except in zero gravity environments.</li></ul></li>
<li>Screw all the screws that fit in the rack mount in the left and right leg (for stability).
<ul><li>With deep units, a Z-shaped bracket may be advisable to secure the rear of the unit against the underside of the tabletop.</li></ul></li>
<li>&nbsp;???</li>
<li>Profit! (note how <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rackable.com/">lackable.com</a> has been bought by sgi recently)</li></ul>
<h2><span id="Note">Note</span></h2>
<p>Current LACK tables have hollow legs; only the top 5 cm (2") is solid. Fitting equipment below the solid section may require the use of cavity plugs, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fischer-international.com/en/products/cavity-fixings/board-fixing/metal-cavity-fixing-hm/519772-hm-5-x-37-s">these</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Goodies">Goodies</span></h2>
<ul><li>You can put food and/or drink on your rack.</li>
<li>You can put a small lamp on top of the rack to see your hardware and/or better find the aforementioned food and drink.</li>
<li>The table can be painted in a color of your preference, or decorated in various ways. The eth0 Design team can advise, for a fee, how to optimally decorate the rack to suit your environment.
<ul><li>That means, no more dull black/gray racks!</li>
<li>Or you can put <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lack2.jpg" title="File:Lack2.jpg">stickers of your favorite event</a> on them.</li></ul></li>
<li>It's easy to colour-code your datacentre: e.g. <span>red</span> for critical services, <span>grey</span> for office automation, <span>green</span> for file-servers, <span>black</span> for systems and network management.</li>

<ul><li>Q: Does the LackRack provide redundant power supply?
<ul><li>A: Only if you add it yourself</li></ul></li>
<li>Q: Can I put my (coffee) mug on top and don't have to worry about it if I spill liquid on the LackRack?
<ul><li>A: You can spill coffee on the LackRack, since it can be cleaned quite easily. However, if you have appliances <b>in</b> the LackRack, there is a chance that these appliances cannot handle the coffee (or any other liquid). You should take precautions in order to protect your appliances</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/catalog/products/00095036">Ikea LACK coffee table</a>: almost twice as deep, and comes with a shelf. Its size allows both short ends to be used as rack space simultaneously. It's interesting to note that Ikea photographed it from the side; an uncommon artistic approach to 19" server rack photography.
It provides for 8 U of hardware: 4 on either side of the shelf.
</p><p>Following ICT tradition, the Enterprise Edition is more than three times as expensive, while providing less stability than two of the regular products combined.

<p>It is clear that Ikea has strived to keep many of their products
rack compatible since so many of them are capable of housing 19"
equipment. See <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/List_of_IkeaRacks" title="List of IkeaRacks">List_of_IkeaRacks</a>

In case you aren’t familiar with the term “data warehouse”, it’s basically a database that centralizes your data to be used for analysis. There are many databases you can choose from, for example in Simon Willison’s talk, he uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. I chose <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a> because I’m familiar with it and so far I have liked what Ive seen. Some features that make it stand out for me are things like <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html">time travel</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/undrop-table.html">undrop table</a>, a rich set of <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/intro-summary-operators-functions.html">functions</a>, among many others.</p><p>Ok great, so we now have an empty database to start with. But a database is only useful when there is data in it to query. So we must choose which datasets to pull into our freshly minted database. I’m going to start with bringing in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> data because I’m a big fan of the site and it has an actual <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a> which means we wont have to be scraping HTML. I’m also going to bring in stock data into the warehouse to see if we can get any stock information out of Hacker News. Finally we’ll analyze the stock market and correlate stocks to the latest GameStop stock craze.</p><p>The first part of the plan will be to get the Hacker News data loaded into Snowflake. Then I’ll use Snowflake’s Data Marketplace to bring in the stock data, which will save me from writing an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform).</p><h2>Getting an initial dump of the Hacker News data.</h2><p>I wanted to write as little code as possible to get this initial historical dump of Hacker News so I decided to use a combination of curl, bash and parallel to get the job done. I first used <a href="https://ec2instances.info/">ec2instances.info</a> to find a relatively cheap CPU per dollar machine. I spun up a c5a.8xlarge on AWS which has 32 vCPUs.<br>I wouldn’t be surprised if there were cheaper options, but I just eyeballed it.</p><p>Let’s get the largest item ID:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611791428293_3993"><div><pre><code>curl https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json</code></pre></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611792427454_4138"><div><p>Which returned: 25,806,058</p><p>Sigh, looks like we’re going to have to do 25 million HTTP calls.

This script can be run without user intervention and will keep the data up-to-date. Using Python to write the ELT gave me more flexibility to fix some things that I saw as issues. For example, the script starts N * 4 (where N is the number of logical cpus) jobs and only produces N * 4 files instead of 1 file per item. This approach will avoid having to do an expensive file combination step at the end. I also added some awesome progress bars to the script so that I knew how many requests remain thanks to <a href="https://github.com/alphatwirl/atpbar/issues/21#issuecomment-766468695">Tai Sakuma</a>.</p><p>Running this script from my laptop (a Dell 9370 Developer Edition with 8 logical cores) and spotty Wi-Fi, script extracts items from the API at about 130 items/second. This is slower than extracting from a c5a.8xlarge machine, but at least my laptop isn’t charging me $1.232/hour for using it. And my script has the benefit of not having to combine millions of tiny files at the end. Let’s test my incremental loading script out on an ec2 instance to see how it really compares with my naive approach.</p><h2>Downloading incremental data from Hacker News using my script</h2></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611883239126_31321"><div><pre><code>$ time { poetry run python main.py ; }

<p><em>Update: large parts of this story may, in fact, be fiction. See the addendum at the end for details.</em></p>
<p>Film rights are a strange and complex thing, especially when it comes to existing properties. The contracts for these things can involve a labyrinthine series of clauses and negotiations, where the owners of the original property want to include cut-off clauses that will enable them to claw back the rights and sell them again, possibly for much more money if the adaptation has been a success, the artistic creator wants to hold on to some level of creative control and the film studio wants to ensure that neither of those things happens. We’ve seen assorted shenanigans at work across the board – the <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2018/08/30/big-bond-themes-and-secret-agent-cover-versions/">James Bond</a> copyright snafu that saw the film rights for <strong>Casino Royale</strong> owned and exploited by another company than the one that made the official series, and perhaps most famously in terms of contractual obligations, the first <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> movie, made as a low-budget throwaway affair simply to ensure that the film rights stayed with Constantin Film, who was not quite ready to make a ‘proper’ version of the story but who saw the potential in the property and didn’t want to let it go.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most absurd of these contractual obligation projects came with <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, which was adapted into a TV series that ran for four seasons – which would suggest a major hit show by 1970s television standards, except for the fact that it never aired. Not a single episode beyond the pilot was shown on TV anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> was a major hit in 1974 and remains one of the most beloved Hollywood comedies – well, perhaps not with Millenials and Generation Z, given the film’s rather liberal use of the sort of racist language that is now strictly forbidden, even in context. Mel Brooks’ comedy western mocked American racism brutally – perhaps a little too brutally in the use of one particular word, which is bandied about throughout the film. It was a different time.</p>

<p>Brooks was on fire as a filmmaker in 1974, and there was every reason to expect <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> to be a massive hit, as indeed it was. Having dealt with studios enough by this point, Brooks knew that they might want to take the project away from him and produce sequels – the story essentially opened itself up for on-going narratives. And so he came up with a cunning plan. The contracts for the film stated that there could only be film sequels if a TV series follow-up was made within six months. Brooks and his legal team were pretty certain that the film was too profane and vulgar to ever be adapted as a TV series. I mean, what could they do? Strip it back to its most basic elements while throwing out everything that made the film what it was?</p>
<p>Well, that was precisely what happened. In 1977, Warner Brothers announced plans for a sequel film – in fact, a series of sequels – to <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, and when Brooks and his lawyers waved the contract at them, they pulled their ace card – a four-season series based on the original film that had gone into production very quickly in 1974. As Brooks explained, <em>“Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another Blazing Saddles, and I say, ‘No. You don’t have the right to do that.’ They say, ‘Yes we do, we’ve been making a TV series and still control the rights.’ What TV series? I haven’t seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it.”</em></p>
<p>You have to almost admire Warner Brothers’ gall here, and – oddly – their belief in <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>. Not only did they rush a series into production in 1974, but they kept it in production – because the contract only allowed a new movie within six months of the last <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> project – for four years until they finally had a movie ready. TV shows might be cheaper than films, but nevertheless, imagine how much they had to spend, making four seasons of a show just to hold onto the film rights.</p>
<p>In fact, the pilot episode of <strong>Black Bart</strong>, as the series is called, was shown once in 1975 on CBS, with no one even noticing. Well, why would they? As well as changing the title (because the contract also failed to state that any TV series be <em>called</em> <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>), Brooks wasn’t credited, with Andrew Bergman, who originally came up with the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> idea listed as creator. The show starred Louis Gossett Jr as Sheriff Bart, continuing his battles against both criminals and racists, while the other film characters were replaced with similar, but not identical characters to avoid crediting Brooks. Both the cast – including Gerrit Graham – and the characters are lightweight versions of the originals, the humour is almost non-existent and the laugh track just hammers home how unfunny the show is. And yet it is a professional work, and arguably no less forced than several other sitcoms of the era. So the question is: why didn’t they just put in a bit more effort and then show the damn thing instead of paying everyone to shoot twenty-four episodes that would sit, unseen, in the Warner Brothers vaults?</p>

<p>Presumably, the answer is that a TV show – even a good TV show – would have diluted the appeal of another film. The 1970s were a different time (we mentioned that, right?) and there was less crossover of film and TV – sure, some films – like <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2020/09/27/go-ape-the-planet-of-the-apes-book-and-comics-of-the-1970s/"><strong>Planet of the Apes</strong></a> – were adapted into TV shows, but those shows were rarely successful and were seen as having essentially killed off any chance of audiences then going to the cinema to watch a movie version. If anything, <strong>Black Bart</strong> might have served as a sign of just how bad a Mel Brooks-free version of <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> could be. So instead of putting any effort into making a decent TV series based on the property (and there’s certainly the potential there), Warner Brothers simply put the least possible effort into making something that would still legally stand up as a TV show that could, in theory, be broadcast – and then buried it.</p>
<p>What the cast and crew thought of all this is hard to gauge – Gossett has talked about the weirdness of it all, but you have to wonder just how anyone managed to drum up any enthusiasm once it became clear that the show would never air. Ironically, the plans for a <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> sequel ultimately went nowhere – by 1979, it was clear that the moment had passed and audience tastes had changed. The sequel was shelved, and the series was finally cancelled. The pilot episode has since turned up on the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> DVD and blu-ray, but the other episodes have yet to be seen. It’s entirely possible that they were never even completed beyond the ones shown to Brooks, and may have been trashed. A pity, as we’ll never know if it accidentally improved.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> We feel it’s important to point out that some sources are claiming since we originally posted this that the entire story – with the exception of the<strong> Black Bart</strong> pilot, which definitely exists and is perhaps a weird enough thing in itself – is in fact a spoof that has somehow become accepted as reality – ‘fake news’, as I believe it is known. There are several sources online claiming that this story is authentic; others claiming that it is satire (links appear in the comments). Unless Mel Brooks – or perhaps Louis Gossett – wants to come clean on the actual facts, it perhaps remains a mystery. Stranger-than-fiction may, or may not, be actual fiction, and isn’t that depressing when it’s a story as good as this? As Tony Wilson said (or possibly didn’t say, there’s the rub), <em>“when&nbsp;you have to choose between the truth and the legend, choose the legend.”</em></p>

<p>This post is not going to bash Google on the ban of Element. It’s about how Google can win the chat app, but how google can build a chat app based on an open chat protocol and create a winning chat platform for them.</p>
<p>Chat apps have been hot for the past couple of years. When I initially Tweeted that chat apps are the new social network, 6-7 years ago (I wish if I can find that tweet, but I can’t seem to find it, maybe it was lost when I deleted all my tweets sometime ago), I remember how people laughed replying how can that even possible, but now as Facebook is on the decline, chat apps are the goto place to hang out with friends.</p>
<p>Google currently doesn’t have a house in the chat app race. Google tried with several chat applications, like Allo, Hangout, Google Talk, none of them took off. Even though Allo looked promising, and was integrated into Android, people never jumped the ship to Allo. And since Google now allowing several chat/video platforms like Hangout, Meet etc, Google’s direction in communication platform seems big vague.</p>
<p>Google also has had a poor history with social networking, Google does not have social in their DNA, it feels like they are engineering, technology first in their approach, while Facebook feels more social first than anything else.</p>
<p>However, after seeing this ban I feel what Google should have a horse in the chat app race, and it should be a matrix/element based chat client. Allow me to explain,</p>
<p>Google should embrace an open protocol like Matrix and build a chat client on top of it, yes it’s against their pattern of hoarding data, and usage of open protocol.</p>
<p>But Google was able to win the email, the email protocol is an open protocol, anyone can implement it, anyone can use any client they want, but still Google was able to create the most popular email service available out their, and even monetise it. </p>
<p>Before Google started gmail, services like hotmail only allowed 200mb of storage, I remember Yahoo deleting my email account because I didn’t login for 6 months (I was still schooling at that time, and didn’t use email much), and not to mention Yahoo, and hotmail had atrocious ads on their email service. But google changed all that, they gave a better UI, more storage, and even a better ad experience.</p>
<p>So what makes then incapable of using an open chat protocol and build a great experience around it? With engineers and money to back a project like that Google can build a good chat service around an open chat protocol.</p>
<p>Even ads might not be a thing, Google can still provide enterprise chat service to organisations, powered by their data servers. They can even keep their source closed if they want to, like they are doing with Gmail, but an open source client would be great.</p>
<p>And Google’s backing for a open chat platform will make people interested about it, and even more people will use it just because it’s from Google. People will be able to use their own clients like Element, or another Matrix client, still and users can build a network greater than a centralised chat service, like we use gmail in our mail app to chat with someone else with a different email provider. </p>
<p>And the bottom line is Facebook, Telegram, Signal, and other chat platforms are going on a race without Google, all providing a centralised experience, with the exception of Signal, who is providing a semi-centralised experience. So even if you can’t beat them, why not try to destroy them all with an open chat protocol?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1565793939038_266584"><div><p>The human genome is an incredible thing. Six billion letters of DNA – that’s more than two metres of DNA in every single cell – containing all the genes that enable a single cell to grow into a fully-formed, fully functioning person. </p><p>So when the first draft sequence of the human genome was published in 2001, researchers around the world were eager to discover exactly how many genes must be packed into our glorious genome.</p><p>The answer was a big surprise.</p><p>Many people thought that it must take at least a hundred thousand genes to make a human – with a sweepstake on offer to the person who made the closest guess to the final number – yet the human genome turns out to contain only 20,000 or so genes (roughly the same number of genes as a fruit fly or nematode worm).</p><p>This seems remarkably low to make an organism with as much dazzling complexity as a human being.  Even more perplexingly, the genes that we do have make up less than two per cent of all that DNA. So what’s the rest?</p><p>To find out, we need to go back in time to 1972.</p><p>That’s when geneticist Susumu Ohno published a paper entitled “So much ‘junk’ DNA in our genome” in an obscure scientific journal, the Brookhaven Symposia in Biology, in which he mused upon a mathematical problem.</p><p>By that point, scientists had already measured how much DNA was present in bacteria and figured out that these little bugs must contain a few thousand genes. They also knew that a single human cell contained at least 750 times as much DNA.</p><p>Ohno did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation – if the number of genes in any genome was directly proportional to the amount of DNA, then humans should have….. three million genes, more or less.</p><p>But, as he pointed out in his paper, ‘lowly lungfish and salamanders’ can have 36 times more DNA in their cells than is present in ours, suggesting that they should have…. A hundred million genes.</p><p>He didn’t believe it. What would a slimy salamander need with all those genes? Therefore, Ohno concluded, the vast majority of the human genome must be junk. And, correspondingly, varying proportions of other organisms’ genomes must be junk too. And once the Human Genome project revealed that the vast majority of our genome doesn’t seem to contain actual genes, it looked like he was right.</p><p>The function of this remaining 98% of the human genome - sometimes called ‘junk DNA’ but more accurately referred to as non-coding DNA – is a hotly debated topic in the world of genetics, fought out within the dignified pages of journals and the more febrile atmosphere of scientific conferences.</p><p>An absolutely massive study published in 2012, known as ENCODE, suggested that around 80% of the human genome was functional – namely, that it did something important for the proper functioning of our cells and bodies. Just under 10 per cent is thought to be control switches responsible for turning genes on and off at the right time and in the right place, while the rest does all manner of things, from producing little pieces of RNA that control gene activity to organising the three-dimensional structure of the DNA inside a cell.</p><p>Others were unconvinced. For example, evolutionary geneticist Chris Ponting suggests that less than 10% of the human genome is functional, based on how much has been strongly preserved through evolutionary time and must therefore be very important.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop we bring in the Onion Test, devised by T. Ryan Gregory and posted on his blog in April 2007. It was later formalised as a scientific paper that he published in 2014, together with Alexander Palazzo.</p><p>Put simply, the Onion Test goes like this.</p><p>The onion in your vegetable drawer has five times more DNA than humans. So if you’re a researcher who thinks that non-coding DNA has a particular function in the genome, can you explain why an onion needs about five times more of it than a human to do the same thing?</p><p>Unpeeling this idea a bit further, Gregory points out that some species of onions have around double the amount of DNA as your regular onions, while others have less than half. Yet they’re pretty much the same and have the same number of genes, so why would they need double or half the amount of non-coding DNA?</p><p>This argument works for all kinds of species, from Ohno’s lowly salamanders with their giant genomes containing roughly the same set of genes as other vertebrates, including humans, to the biggest genome discovered to date, which belongs to the Japanese canopy flower, Paris Japonica, with around 150 time more DNA in its genome than a human.</p><p>Then there’s the poisonous Fugu pufferfish – often eaten (very carefully!) as a delicacy in Japan.  They have remarkably compact genomes, roughly an eighth of the size of our own yet containing almost exactly the same repertoire of genes and very little junk.</p><p>Perhaps our obsession with finding function for all the junk in our genome comes from a desire to think that humans are something special in the biological world – certainly more special than an onion.</p><p> But in the words of the grumpy geneticist Dan Graur, who I interviewed for my book Herding Hemingway’s Cats in which I dig into the junk in our genetic trunk,  “Either you have to assume that humans are the pinnacle of creation –that everything is functional and those organisms with more DNA than us have junk DNA but we don’t. Or you have to assume that humans are a regular organism that has junk DNA just like everything else.”</p><p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2007/04/onion-test/" target="_blank">T.

The output capacitor for 5V was in worse shape. A 3900 uF / 6VDC Sprague with impressive connectors never managed to get to the nominal voltage even using a 560 ohm resistor and plenty of time. <br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">&nbsp;<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O4FWlpH.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Capacitor replacement" src="http://i.imgur.com/O4FWlpH.png"></a></p><br><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 800 x 598)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 800 x 598)"></span><p>Nowadays there are no such capacitors as 3900 uF / 6VDC with screw connectors so I replaced it with a 6800uF / 40VDC RIFA&nbsp; </p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">With a new capacitor the power supply managed well to deliver 3 Amps in my dummy load which after while smelt nicely from hot pertinax<br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/3v9ATUo.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="test" src="http://i.imgur.com/3v9ATUo.jpg"></a></p><br><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1000 x 747)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1000 x 747)"></span><p>But does the it work if one connects the power supply to the back plane? Unfortunately it doesn't. Apparently two signals from the power supply was permanently in low state, BUS DC LO L and BUS AC LO L. These are active low signals and in its' low state the inhibits the clock generation of the main CPU.</p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">The schematics above describes the 5V regulator of the H777 power supply. The blue marked area is a current source circuit which is fed by incoming raw DC and which charges a 50uF capacitor which thus creates a nice ramp signal. A resistor ladder circuit and a number of comparators generate the BUS DC LO L, BUS AC LO L and an internal signal which causes the clock signal to the main PWM switch. The voltage over the capacitor never exceeded 20.4 V which was not enough to get the two of the comparators to change polarity. It seems like to much current is consumed from the current source. The capacitor was replaced, but no difference. But the current source was not only connected to the capacitor. It was also connected to the red marked area which is a crow bar circuit. If any of the main switch transistors would fail a 38 V raw DC would be the result on the output. Not very good. Therefore there is a zener diode and a couple of thyristors which fires off if the output voltage exceeded 5.6 VDC. This will also short circuit the current source, effectively stopping all activities in&nbsp; power supply. The problem seemed to be that even under normal circumstances 1.5 mA was consumed by leakage in the thyristor even though hasn't fired. Apparently all thyristors have leakages but not this much.<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Thyristor" height="389" src="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" width="400"></a></p><p>Change of thyristor to a modern BT145 resulted in a fully functional power supply!</p><p><span>Testing the CPU</span></p><p>All cables were connected and the power was switched on. No smoke leaked anywhere which was a good sign. But the RUN lamp were just flashing briefly. Pressing INIT switch on the console only gave a short blink of the RUN lamp. Not very promising.</p><p>A check with the oscilloscope on the main clock signal of then CPU board showed that is starts up does 8 cycles, the stops for a couple micro seconds then does three more cycles, yet another stop and the three cycles and then nothing.</p><p><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)"></span></p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="8 micro cycles" src="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png"></a></p><br>From the picture above one can deduce that the cycle time is closer to 250 ns rather than 260 ns&nbsp; specified in "Computer Engineering". However using a delay line in a feedback loop may not be that accurate. 4 MHz is a quite impressive speed at least in the mid seventies. </span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Further than this is probably not possible using an oscilloscope only. For that purpose I have gotten this little USB connected tool:<br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">But to cover the entire machine with address and data bus one would need four of these. Luckily at this point in time I was offered to buy a HP1664A logic analyser at an affordable price!<br></span></p><div><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><b>Logic&nbsp;analyser&nbsp;fault tracing</b></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">After some initial problems which was caused by mixed-up signals and also forgetting that the machine is active low I got some good traces from the analyser:<br></span></p><div><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SPIxi1B.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="micro code" src="http://i.imgur.com/SPIxi1B.png"></a></p><p>The picture above shows the output of the micro address pipeline register. So it actually shows the second micro step as the first micro-step. But this is actually the correct sequence comparing to this <a href="http://vaxhaven.com/images/1/11/EK-KD11D-TM-PRE.pdf">document</a>. </p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vCoTm8v.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Address bus and databus" src="http://i.imgur.com/vCoTm8v.png"></a></p><br>The interesting with this trace is that the CPU output addresses 24 and the 26 on the address bus. On the data bus it then receives 165020 which is the to be PC to start execution at after power fail, this is also the first address of the diagnostics program of the M9312. But looking at the address the CPU subsequently outputs on the address bus it is 167020. For some reason bit 10 has became high! Measuring more closely on a bus receiver chip, DS8641 shows that even though the input is at 3.31 V the output is a 3.78 V! This seems to be wrong!</span></p><p><span><span face="verdana, sans-serif">It is alive</span></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><b><br></b>This is the little evil thing:<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="DS8641" height="320" src="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" width="319"></a></p><br>Unfortunately DS8641 is not a very common IC. It is especially adapted to Digital open collector buses. I ordered some from a seller on Ebay located in China but since the delivery time is quite long I resorted to desoldered an IC from another board and replaced the faulty chip on the CPU board.<p>This time the result was much better:</p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/soZUSxo.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Waiting for TX ready" src="http://i.imgur.com/soZUSxo.png"></a></p><br>However it ends up spinning waiting for TX ready bit of the console serial port to become ready.

I used the <a href="http://www.dbit.com/putr/">PUTR</a>&nbsp;tool to extract them from the image. Please make sure to copy them as binary otherwise you end up like me scratching my head for hours...

It needed just a few modifications to the serial port code to compile cleanly.</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Then I started the work to get a bootable TU58 image for my TU58 emulator. It is far simpler to use an emulator to all this kind of work. I used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dbit.com/">E11</a>&nbsp;to do all this. First I tried XXDP 2.6 which I found an image for on bitsavers:</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Unfortunately it required more memory than my machine had so it won't be possible to run this version. Besides the GKAB diagnostics doesn't run at all on the emulated PDP-11/04 for some reason!</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">I then spent some time to make a TU58 image for XXDP+, an earlier version of the XXDP suite.</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">This is how I did that using E11:</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Running GKAAA0.BIC under XXDP+ on the real machine works fine.

It does this by setting the stack pointer to 400 and then enable console TX interrupts. This will cause an immediate TX interrupt to occur. This will decrement the stack pointer below 400 and immediately trigger a trap to vector 4/6.
