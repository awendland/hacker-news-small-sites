<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PostgreSQL backups can be categorized into two types: <em>logical</em> and <em>physical</em>. This post briefly covers each type and discusses the situations where you would use either one.</p><p>We'll cover some of the many tools you can use for Postgres backups in future posts.</p><h2>Logical Backups</h2><p>This form of backup is typically achieved by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html">translating all the data into a set of SQL commands and writing it into a single file</a>. This can then be fed to any database cluster to recreate everything. In your CLI, performing logical backups can be as easy as:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dump db_name </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for a single database, and:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dumpall </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for an entire database cluster. Both the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-dumpall.html">pg_dumpall</a> utilities have their respective additional options for you to choose from and set up your desired logical backup setting. Recovering from them is comparably as simple:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>psql -d db_name -f file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>Simpler and quicker way of performing backups</h4><p>As shown above, a single command is enough to perform a logical backup and another to recover from it. As a novice with databases, this would be an ideal and non-intimidating ensure that your database is backed up at all times.</p><h4>Migration between different major versions of Postgres</h4><p>If you are planning to migrate to a different major version of Postgres (for example, from Postgres 11 to Postgres 12), logical backups via <code>pg_dumpall</code> would surely be your <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">tool of choice</a>. This is mainly because internal data storage formats may differ between major versions. This is the basis of physical backups, eliminating it as an option when upgrading. We'll go deeper into migrations and how to perform them in another post.</p><h4>Backing up a single specific database</h4><p>With <code>pg_dump</code>, you can constantly back up a single, targeted database.</p><h2>Physical Backups</h2><p>Physical backups pertain to the actual set of files or file systems where your database data is stored. One option for physical backups involves <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-file.html">taking a snapshot</a> of your data files by making a copy of them.</p><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>More ideal for larger databases</h4><p>As your database grows to the size of a few gigabytes, backing it up through physical backups is more ideal than through logical backups. As explained <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#the-performance-impact-of-logical-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, over time, performing logical backups in large databases could lead to degraded performance for other queries. Given the long run time as well to successfully perform a logical backup on a large database, errors have a higher chance of occurring, making the eventual backup unusable.</p><h4>Achieving Point in Time Recovery</h4><p>Postgres also generates <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">Write Ahead Log</a> (WAL) files, which can be used together with a backed-up file system to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html">recover a database up to any chosen point in time</a>. When disaster strikes, this is one of the best options for recreating your database up to the point right before the unfortunate happens. This greatly minimizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</a> along the way. Even better, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL-G</a> are readily available to simplify the steps involved in setting this up.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, logical and physical backups are generated differently from one another. Neither has an advantage over the other. Depending on your needs, each brings unique uses to the table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Logical</th><th>Physical</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simpler way of getting started with backups.</td><td>Better way of handling backups for larger database clusters.</td></tr><tr><td>Using it to migrate between different major versions of Postgres.</td><td>Using it for Point in Time Recovery.</td></tr><tr><td>Having the option to back up a single database.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></section></div>]]>

                    <section>
                <p>I learned how to build websites the old fashioned way: looking at website source code and trying to replicate the things I saw. I threw in the odd book for the stuff I couldn’t <em>see</em> (like PHP/MySQL), and I was on my way.</p>

<p>This was back in 1999, when we’d write things like <code>&lt;font size="4" color="#000000"&gt;</code> and DHTML was a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>When CSS came along my approach to learning didn’t differ. But I <em>really</em> wish I’d taken the time to learn CSS properly: there was so much fundamental stuff I missed.</p>

<p>Here are some things I didn’t know that I wish I’d learned earlier.</p>

            </section>

                <p>Even though I <em>knew</em> about these properties, I didn’t fully understand them for a long time.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>block</code> elements expand horizontally to take up a whole line (like a heading). We can apply vertical margin to these.</li>
<li><code>inline</code> elements expand horizontally just enough to contain their content (like <code>strong</code> or <code>em</code> elements). We <strong>cannot apply vertical margins to these</strong> and they should usually be placed inside a <code>block</code> element.</li>
<li><code>inline-block</code> elements are like <code>inline</code> elements, <strong>but you can apply vertical margins to these</strong> (making them useful for things like buttons).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, <code>block</code> elements have a blue border, <code>inline</code> elements have an orange background, and our <code>inline-block</code> element has a red border.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>Images being inline by default isn’t a problem, but it can cause confusion when trying to position them or add vertical margins.</p>

<p>If your CSS reset doesn’t include this already, I’d suggest adding the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>img {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will make their behaviour much more predictable. You might also want to add <code>max-width: 100%;</code> to stop them breaking out of their container, too.</p>

<h2 id="how-height-and-width-are-calculated">How height and width are calculated</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>By default, the width/height of a box is calculated by adding together the dimensions of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content area</li>
<li>Padding area</li>
<li>Border area</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t usually a problem for an element’s height: we’re usually not too bothered about how content reflows vertically. The problems usually occur when trying to calculate an element’s width, especially if there’s more than one element in a row.</p>

<p>If we had the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.some-class {
    width: 50%;
    padding: 2em;
    border: 0.1rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The total calculated <code>width</code> for <code>.some-class</code> would be:</p>

<p><code>50% + 4em + 0.2rem</code></p>

<p>That’s because of a property called <code>box-sizing</code> which has a default value of <code>content-box</code>. This value means the <code>width</code> property <strong>applies to the content area</strong>: everything else is added on top of this.</p>

<p>We can change this for all elements with the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Returning to our example, the element’s width would now apply to the <code>border</code>, so our element’s total <code>width</code> would be <code>50%</code>.</p>

<p>What happens to the <code>border</code> and <code>padding</code>? Those properties/values still apply, but they don’t affect the total <code>width</code> of the element: they sit within the defined area.</p>

                    <p>We haven’t discussed <code>margin</code> here because <strong>margin is the space between elements</strong>. For that reason, it is never part of this calculation.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>If an element has no <code>background</code> or <code>border</code>, it can appear that <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> are the same. They are not!</p>

<ul>
<li><code>margin</code> is the space <strong>between</strong> elements</li>
<li><code>padding</code> is space <strong>inside</strong> an element</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes <code>padding</code> useful for elements that have a <code>background</code>. We often don’t want the content to be close to the edge of the element’s box and <code>padding</code> helps us achieve that.</p>

                <p>This has been the source of frustration for CSS newcomers for a long time. Rachel Andrew <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/#margin-collapsing">describes the behaviour</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When margins collapse, they will combine so that the space between the two elements becomes the larger of the two margins. The smaller margin essentially ending up inside the larger one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we have two block elements with <code>margin-bottom: 1em</code> on one element and <code>margin-top: 1.5em</code> on the element directly below it, the total space between the two elements would be <code>1.5em</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that here:</p>

                <p>When two margins meet, the larger margin absorbs the smaller margin. If the margins are the same value, they absorb each other.</p>

<p>As soon as we know this, <code>margin</code> calculations become easier. It might also change our approach to managing them, and that’s where something like <a href="https://cssfordesigners.com/articles/managing-vertical-margins-in-css">the Lobotomised Owl selector can be useful</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Margins don’t collapse when the parent element is set to <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code>.</p>

                <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It’s no surprise therefore that the <strong>cascade</strong> is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.</p>

<p>Though we might be aware of how our own stylesheets interact with each other, we have to remember that there’s <strong>always a default browser stylesheet</strong>. This is loaded <em>before</em> any custom stylesheets, making it easy to redeclare existing values.</p>

<p>The declared styles vary by browser, but they’re the reason that, by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headings have different sizes</li>
<li>Text is black</li>
<li>Lists have bullet points</li>
<li>Elements have any <code>display</code> property (such as <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>)</li>

                <p>Using pixels (<code>px</code>) is tempting because they’re simple to understand: declare <code>font-size: 24px</code> and the text will be <code>24px</code>. But that won’t provide a great user experience, particularly for users who resize content at the browser level or zoom into content.</p>

<p>I started using <code>em</code> (and later <code>rem</code>) for font sizing early. It took much longer to feel comfortable using <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> for other things such as <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>border</code>.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is critical to making relative units manageable. For instance, we might use <code>em</code> for <code>@media</code> queries and vertical margins, but <code>rem</code> for consistent <code>border-width</code>.</p>

<p>The benefits of going all-in on relative sizing are well-worth the small adjustment in thinking that requires.</p>

July 16, 2020 | https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
        css-media-vars adds several --custom-css-variables, all namespaced with "--media-" and based on media queries, onto the HTML tag. These vars act as universal mixins for your CSS values. If the media query is true, your value will be used. If it's false, the var(..., fallback) will be used.</p><p>
        
        For example, there are several named breakpoints that respond to the width of the screen, such as <code>--media-lte-sm</code>.</p><p>
        
        In your CSS, if you want a value to only apply when the screen is less than or equal to the "small" breakpoint range, you mix it into your value:<br>
        <code>--my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;</code><br>
        From this point, you can use your variable anywhere and it will only be "2px" if the media query is true. Else, it uses the fallback you provide, like so:<br>
        <code>border: var(--my-small-value, 15px) solid green;</code><br>
        <img src="https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/suchborder.gif" alt="Border changing size at 900px breakpoint"><br>
        Here's a link to the jsbin pictured in the gif: <a href="https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output">https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output</a></p><p>
        
        If you need multiple break points, all you have to do is mix a different breakpoint into another variable and use it in the first fallback:<br>
        <code>
          --my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;<br>
          --my-medium-value: var(--media-md) 15px;<br>
          border: var(--my-small-value, var(--my-medium-value, 30px)) solid green;<br>
        </code><br>
        In this case, because the small values are listed first, this approach is <b>mobile-first</b>! CSS Variables don't compile the fallback unless it's used (similar to the expected short-circuting of conditionals in JavaScript).</p><p>
        
        This is all vanilla CSS. No JS or build step is necessary.<br>
        The library is small and built on a CSS trick called "Space Toggle" discovered in the development of <a href="http://augmented-ui.com/">augmented-ui</a>. You can read more about Space Toggle in these tweets which contain links to JSBins you can explore further with:<br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1283596399196680192">Second Tweet, a simple demo</a><br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1282303255826046977">First Tweet, an advanced demo</a></p><p>
        
        Browser support for CSS Variables is currently 94% globally according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">caniuse</a>.<br>
        Each of the --media-* vars are using the actual media query in CSS to switch them to the "true" state. Browser support depends on the feature but will always behave as if it's "false" if the media query isn't supported in the user's browser, such as <code>--media-prefers-light</code> which only recently gained traction.

<p>After six weeks of work since <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-3">Alpha 3</a>, we are happy to
            announce the immediate release of EdgeDB 1.0 Alpha 4 “Barnard’s Star”. You
            can <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">download</a> it in a number of ways or try it out in our
            <a href="https://tutorial.edgedb.com/">interactive tutorial</a> without the need to install anything.</p>

<p>This time around we focused on making the database more intuitive from
            both the server and the client perspective.  While there’s fewer changes
            due to our newly adopted six-week release cycle, we’re able to deliver them
            to you much quicker.  Let’s go through some highlights of the release!</p>
<h4>What’s EdgeDB</h4>
<p>EdgeDB is an advanced <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb">open source</a> relational database based on
            PostgreSQL.  The project aims to give developers and data engineers a highly
            efficient and productive database technology while addressing the
            <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql">shortcomings of SQL</a> and its surrounding ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>high-level data model and type system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a powerful, expressive and extensible query language that allows working
                    with complex data relationships easily;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first-class support for schema migrations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for converting arbitrary strictly typed data to and from JSON
                    via a simple cast operator;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>out-of-the-box interoperability via REST and GraphQL.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the ways in which we’re setting EdgeDB apart from previous generation
                databases is the focus on usability of day-to-day tasks.  One particularly
                gnarly topic is maintenance of server instances: installing a new version,
                upgrading existing databases to a new version, setting up an instance to
                run properly as a service daemon, accessing logs, and so on.  It gets
                especially tricky when multiple operating systems provide their own unique
                ways to achieve those tasks.  Even better if the user needs to keep
                a few versions running concurrently.</p>
<p>We looked at how efficient <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> is in ensuring the user
                has a fully functional up-to-date installation of the Rust toolchain,
                and got inspired: what if we can provide <em>this</em> experience for a database?</p>
<p>The end result is the new <code>edgedb server</code> group of commands that ships with
                the default EdgeDB CLI. Its design was planned and discussed as part of an
                RFC process which, as the rest of EdgeDB, is open. <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1001-edgedb-server-control.rst">Check it out</a>!</p>
<p>The most visible change related to <code>edgedb server</code> is that it is now
                the new recommended way to install EdgeDB servers on your operating
                system.  See <code>edgedb server install --help</code> for details.  The
                underlying installer will still use your operating system’s package
                manager but it provides instance configuration in ways that allow for
                running multiple EdgeDB versions concurrently on one machine.  And with
                <code>edgedb server upgrade</code> you can easily bump the version on an existing
                installation without having to redo configuration or dump and restore
                data manually.</p>
<p>And how do you get the new CLI tool on your machine?  We redesigned the
                <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">Download</a> page to be more inviting, providing a new
                cross-platform way to install EdgeDB with a single-liner in the terminal.
                And if you’re a macOS user, you might want to use our new Homebrew tap!</p>

<div id="javascript-bindings-got-more-powerful">

<p>We supercharged <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/">edgedb-js</a>, our JavaScript client for EdgeDB,
                with an efficient <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/clients/01_js/usage#connection-pools">connection pooling</a> implementation. This
                allows users write faster applications with less code.</p>

<pre><span><span><span>import</span> <span>{</span>createPool<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'edgedb'</span><span>;</span>

  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    conn<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span>'SELECT business_logic(10 / $num)'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>num<span>:</span> <span>42</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
    conn<span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>'ROLLBACK'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>



<span>const</span> conn <span>=</span> <span>await</span> pool<span>.</span><span>acquire</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>await</span> pool<span>.</span><span>release</span><span>(</span>conn<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></span></span></pre>
<p>We also thought hard about the API and decided that <code>fetch*()</code> function
                names don’t really sound very natural when you’re trying to insert or update
                data. We renamed them to <code>query*()</code> which is the obvious name in hindsight:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span>conn<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>await</span> conn<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span><span>`
    INSERT User {
      name := 'Alice'
    }
  `</span></span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The change actually originated in our Python client and this is <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python/issues/51">where the
                    change was discussed</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="describe-is-worth-a-thousand-greps">
<h2 id="describe-is-worth-a-thousand-greps"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-4-barnard-s-star#describe-is-worth-a-thousand-greps"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>DESCRIBE Is Worth a Thousand Greps</h2>
<p>As part of the usability sprint we made <code>DESCRIBE</code> better.  When
                describing objects, it will now list all matches for the specified name
                if available.  This is particularly interesting in case of user functions
                masking user types or standard types/functions.</p>
<p><code>DESCRIBE ROLES</code> and <code>DESCRIBE SYSTEM CONFIG</code> in turn allow you to
                quickly assess the respective areas of the database, and make dumping an
                entire server instance easier.</p>
</div>
<div id="stored-migrations-are-coming">

<p>The back-end implementation for the much improved workflow for migrations
                is mostly complete.  The next step is providing a CLI for it, which we
                plan to release as part of Alpha 5.</p>
<p>We think this set of features will be an important foundation of successful
                EdgeDB adoption. You can read more about them in our <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1000-migrations.rst">open RFC document</a> on the topic.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-can-talk-to-us-right-on-github">

<p>GitHub is introducing a new feature called <a href="https://github.com/orgs/edgedb/discussions">Discussions</a>, a
                way to keep conversations happen close to the code which don’t really belong
                in Issues or Pull Requests.</p>
<p>We used to use Spectrum Chat for this purpose but as soon as we tried out
                Discussions, we knew this is a natural fit for us and our community.
                We’re an open product with a strong GitHub presence and you probably already
                have a GitHub account… so <a href="https://github.com/orgs/edgedb/discussions">come talk to us!</a></p>
</div>
<div id="summary">

<p>Barnard’s Star is the first release under our new release cycle. Our ambition
                is to always deliver frontpage-worthy new features, but we also understand
                those never get built in one development sprint.  At the same time, frequent
                milestones have many advantages both for us and our users.</p>
<p>With this in mind we’re proud to share Barnard’s Star with you, a release
                which is a step forward that tells a story.  We hope you’ll enjoy the
                improvements we’ve made, and just as importantly, come along for the
                ride and witness how they’re built <em>as they are being built</em>.</p>
<p>As usual, the <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/changelog/1_0_a4">change log</a> provides a detailed story of the
                changes in this release.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to join the conversation <a href="https://github.com/orgs/edgedb/discussions">on GitHub
                    Discussions</a>, or ask in form of <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb">a bug report or a feature
                    request</a>.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about our tech stack, we recently started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EdgeDB">a
                    YouTube channel</a>. At the moment we’re running a series

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure how much of the hemoglobin in blood is carrying oxygen (oxygen saturation).</p>
<p>If you work in healthcare (or have been patient !) you are very likely to have come across pulse oximeters. You can find them in areas such as operating rooms, recovery, critical care, wards, and ambulances.</p>
<p>Pulse oximeters are in common use because they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>non invasive</li>
<li>cheap to buy and use</li>
<li>can be very compact</li>
<li>detects hypoxaemia earlier than you using your eyes to see cyanosis.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Oxygen Saturation</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure oxygen saturation. Before we learn the principles of how pulse oximeters work, we need to have an understanding of what oxygen saturation is.</p>
<p>We all know that we need oxygen for life. ( Some of you may find this section a little too basic. In that case, to skip this short section, click this link to go to next section Physical properties used in pulse oximetry )</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif" alt="solo_oxygen" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen enters the lungs and then is passed on into blood. The blood carries the oxygen to the various organs in our body. The main way oxygen is carried in our blood is by means of hemoglobin. You can imagine hemoglobin molecules( Hb) as “cars” and the “roads” being our blood vessels. The oxygen molecules get into these cars and travel around the body till they reach their destination.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg" alt="cars_wikipedia" width="800" height="431" srcset="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>Let us consider these ” hemoglobin cars”.</p>
<p>The hemoglobin without oxygen we will call de oxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy Hb). The hemoglobin with oxygen, we will call oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy Hb).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif" alt="oxy_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen saturation simply refers to the percentage of the available hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Take the situations below. There are 16 hemoglobin units and none of the 16 have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 0 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif" alt="zero_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Here, 8 of the 16 Hb have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 50 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif" alt="fifty_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Similarly for 75 % …</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif" alt="seventy_five_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>And of course , when all the Hb have oxygen, the saturation is 100 %</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif" alt="hundred_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>So in summary, oxygen saturation tells you the percentage of the total hemoglobin that is carrying oxygen.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Physical properties used in pulse oximetry</h3>
<p>Pulse oximetry uses light to work out oxygen saturation. Light is emitted from light sources which goes across the pulse oximeter probe and reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif" alt="red_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>If a finger is placed in between the light source and the light detector, the light will now have to pass through the finger to reach the detector. Part of the light will be absorbed by the finger and the part not absorbed reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif" alt="red_finger_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>The amount of light that is absorbed by the finger depends on many physical properties and these properties are used by the pulse oximeter to calculate the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>The amount of light absorbed depends on the following:</p>
<p>1. concentration of the light absorbing substance.</p>
<p>2. length of the light path in the absorbing substance</p>
<p>3. oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorbs red and infrared light differently</p>
<p>Don’t worry ! All the above will be explained in the next sections:</p>
<p>The physical properties that a pulse oximeter employs will be explained using the probe shown below. A finger is shown inserted into the probe. Above the finger are the light sources that emit light. In the finger is an artery which carries the blood the pulse oximeter is interested in and a vein through which the blood leaves the finger. Below the finger is the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif" alt="av_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<hr>
<h4>Physical property No.1 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</h4>
<p>Hemoglobin (Hb) absorbs light. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of Hb in the blood vessel. In the diagram below, the blood vessels in both fingers have the same diameter. However, one blood vessel has a low Hb concentration ( i.e. low number of Hb in each unit volume of blood) and the other blood vessel has a high Hb concentration ( i.e. high number of Hb in each unit volume of blood). Each single Hb absorbs some of the light, so more the Hb per unit area, more is the light is absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Beer’s Law”.</p>
<p>Beer’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</p>
<p>By measuring how much light reaches the light detector, the pulse oximeter knows how much light has been absorbed. More the Hb in the finger , more is the light absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif" alt="conc_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.2 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the light path.</h4>
<p>Look at the two fingers shown below. Both arteries have the same concentration (same Hb per unit area, blue square) However, the artery on right is wider than the one on the left.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif" alt="square_frames" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The light emitted from the source has to travel through the artery. The light travels in a shorter path in the narrow artery and travels through a longer path in the wider artery ( paths are shown as green lines below). Though the concentration of Hb is the same in both arteries, the light meets more Hb in the wider artery, since it travels in a longer path. Therefore, longer the path the light has to travel, more is the light absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Lambert’s Law”.</p>
<p>Lambert’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the path that the light has to travel in the absorbing substance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif" alt="light_path" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.3 : oxyhemoglobin absorbs more infrared light than red light &amp; deoxyhemoglobin absorbs more red light than infrared light (this is explained below !)</h4>
<p>We have seen how concentration and light path affect the absorbance of light. In addition to these, the pulse oximeter makes use of another important property to calculate oxygen saturation. That is, oxy hemoglobin and deoxy hemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way.</p>
<p>Before we go further, we need to remember what wavelength is. All light is composed of waves. The distance between the “tips” of the waves is equal to the wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif" alt="wavelength" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Light wavelengths are very short, and the unit of measurement is nanometer (nm) ( 1 meter = 1,000,000,000 nanometers !). For an example, the wave on the left has a wavelength of 650 nm and the wave on the right has a longer wavelength of 950 nm.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif" alt="wavelength_number" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Different “colors” of light have their own wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif" alt="wave_show" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses the property that oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way. This property can be demonstrated in a laboratory as will be now described. We can first demonstrate how oxyhemoglobin absorbs light of different wavelengths in a specific way. We use a special light source of which we can adjust the wavelength of the light it emits. This light source sequentially passes light of different wavelengths through a sample of oxy Hb. The detector notes how much light, at each wavelength, has been absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif" alt="red_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A graph for the absorbance of oxy hemoglobin at different wavelengths will look like this. It shows that oxy Hb doesn’t absorb the same amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif" alt="oxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>We can repeat the same demonstration using deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif" alt="blue_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Again notice , how like oxy Hb, Deoxy Hb absorbs different amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif" alt="deoxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Now let us see the absorbance graph of oxy Hb and the absorbance graph of deoxy Hb together so you can compare them. Note how each of them absorbs light of different wavelengths very differently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif" alt="combined_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses two lights to analyze hemoglobin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif" alt="r_ir_finger" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>One is a red light, which has a wavelength of approximately 650 nm. The other is an infrared light, which has a wavelength of 950 nm. (Throughout our description, we will show the infrared light in light blue. In reality, infrared light is invisible to the human eye.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif" alt="labelled_led" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Now look at the oxy Hb absorbance graph again, but this time paying attention to the wavelengths of light used in pulse oximeters. You will see that oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif" alt="oxy_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Below is the graph that shows the absorbance of deoxy Hb. It is seen from the graph that deoxy Hb absorbs more Red light than Infrared light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif" alt="deoxy_aborb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>To make the comparison of absorbance of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb easier, here is a composite graph showing the absorbance of both. You will see that :</p>
<p>Oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light</p>
<p>Deoxy Hb absorbs more red light than infrared light</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif" alt="combined_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>You might find the memory aide below useful to remember the wavelengths absorbed by oxy Hb and deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif" alt="absorb_memory" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter works out the oxygen saturation by comparing how much red light and infra red light is absorbed by the blood. Depending on the amounts of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb present, the ratio of the amount of red light absorbed compared to the amount of infrared light absorbed changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif" alt="oxy_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Using this ratio, the pulse oximeter can then work out the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif" alt="ratio_computer" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>For an example, at 100 % saturation, the absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will be same as that seen with the oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_ratio.gif" alt="hundred_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>At 0 % saturation, there is only deoxy Hb. The absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will therefore be same as that seen with the de oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_ratio.gif" alt="zero_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Now look at when the patient has an oxygen saturation of 75 %. The blood has both , oxy Hb and deoxy Hb. The absorbance pattern is now somewhere in between the oxy Hb curve and deoxy Hb …</p></div></div></section></div></main></div></div></div>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For the Dashbit website, we wanted to avoid tracking users as much as possible. This means no cookies and unfortunately most analytics use cookies for tracking and/or fingerprinting. However, we still want to see which pages on our website are being frequently accessed. For this purpose, we have decided to roll our own analytics system.</p>
<p>
In this article, we will cover how we implemented the analytics system with Ecto upserts and how we have used the Elixir registry and Elixir processes to reduce the pressure on the database.</p>
<h2>
Tracking with upserts</h2>
<p>
The idea is very simple: every time someone accesses a page, we will store this information in the database. However, we don’t need to track each access at the instant they happen. For us, tracking how many accesses a page had in a day is completely fine. Therefore, every time a page is accessed on a given date, we will attempt to insert an entry in the database. If an entry already exists, we update its counter instead.</p>
<p>
Luckily, this can be done with an upsert in Ecto. Let’s first define the schema for the database resource:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>MyApp.Metrics.Metric</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Ecto.Schema</span><span>

  </span><span>@primary_key</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>
  </span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>"metrics"</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:counter</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
It has three fields: a date, the page path, and the counter (number of accesses). The date and path make a composite primary key. Our migration looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Repo.Migrations.CreateMetrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-1">do</span><span>

<p>
The code above performs an upsert, incrementing the number of accesses in a page by the value of <code>counter</code>, which is typically 1. If an entry does not exist, one is immediately created.</p>
<p>
This is the core of our analytics. It is a very straight-forward solution, but it does have a strong requirement on the database accepting all of our writes. While most applications heavily rely on a database, the analytics system is the only place in our website that uses a database, so we believe it is important to show an article, such as this blog post, even if there is an error when talking to the storage layer. To address this, we have decided to move the upserts to separate processes.</p>
<h2>
Async and batched writes with processes</h2>
<p>
As laid out in the previous section, we want to move all the database writes done by our analytics code to a separate process. Another concern we have with our solution so far is how it will handle overloads. If there is a huge spike in traffic, could we end up putting too much pressure in the database? In this sense, would it be a good idea to batch our writes?</p>
<p>
To be honest, our application will be just fine with spikes. Most of our page loads are within hundreds of microseconds, thanks to Phoenix, and our database usage is minimal. On the other hand, such a small project is a perfect opportunity to experiment, so we decided to explore how our analytics solution would look like if we performed writes asynchronously and in batches.</p>
<p>
Here is what we came up with. Every time a user accesses a page, we will spawn an Elixir process that tracks all accesses to that page. If a process already exists for said page, we will message the existing process instead. The goal of this process is to collect all accesses within a time interval, writing to the database after X seconds.</p>
<p>
We are going to call this the <code>Worker</code> process and it starts like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5734826703-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>GenServer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>restart</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:temporary</span></code></pre>
<p>
We define a module for the process and declare it as a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html"><code>GenServer</code></a>. We also say that this process is <code>:temporary</code>. I.e. if it dies, we don’t want the supervisor to restart it. That’s because we are assuming that, if the process dies, our logic that dynamically spawns processes for each page will eventually start a new one anyway.</p>
<p>
Next we define the <code>init</code> callback of the process:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>init</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>flag</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">(</span><span>:trap_exit</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">)</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_counter</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">}</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>init</code> callback traps exits and sets the process state to <code>{path, 0}</code>. The first element is the page path, the second element is the number of page visits.</p>
<p>
Our process should be able to receive a <code>:bump</code> message. This message is sent whenever we need to bump the counter and is handled by the <code>handle_info</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">(</span><span>:bump</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-3">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-9">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
If we receive the <code>:bump</code> when the page had no access (i.e. counter is zero), we will bump the counter to 1 and we will also schedule an upsert event, so we eventually write those accesses to the database. If the counter is more than 0, we simply bump it and return an updated state.</p>
<p>
The scheduling and upsert code will look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>schedule_upsert</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">(</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-2">do</span><span>

    </span><span># same function as the previous section</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-13">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>schedule_upsert()</code> function schedules a message to the current process (<code>self()</code>). The message will be named <code>:upsert</code> and it will be delivered in a random value between 10s to 20s. The reason we picked a random value is to avoid a scenario where multiple processes for different pages are spawned at the same time and they all write to the database at the same time.</p>
<p>
Next we define another <code>handle_info</code> clause, this time to handle the scheduled <code>:upsert</code> message. This clause simply invokes the <code>upsert!</code> function, defined in the previous section, and resets the state back to <code>{path, 0}</code>. This makes it so that, once there is a new bump, we will schedule a new upsert.</p>
<p>
Finally, we implement the <code>terminate</code> callback, which will be invoked whenever our application is shutting down:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>terminate</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-1">(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1299229119-2">{</span><span>_path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-2">}</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:ok</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>terminate</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-3">(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1299229119-4">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-4">}</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-3">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>upsert!</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-5">(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-5">)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>
If our application is shutting down, we may have pending writes in our worker, so we want to send them to the database as part of our termination logic. One important thing to remember is that the <code>terminate</code> callback is not called by default when shutting down, unless you are trapping exits. That’s why we called <code>Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)</code> in the <code>init</code> function.</p>
<p>
The process we just implemented delivers all of the requirements we have so far: writes are now asynchronous, as they happen in a separate process, and they are also batched, using intervals between 10s and 20s. The last step we need to implement is to actually spawn those processes on the fly as users navigate through the website.</p>
<h2>
Dynamic processes with the Elixir registry</h2>
<p>
In order to spawn and find processes for each page, we are going to use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html">Elixir’s <code>Registry</code></a>. We also need a dynamic supervisor which is going to be the parent of all worker processes. Let’s implement this logic in the overaching <code>Metrics</code> module, alongside our <code>bump(page)</code> function.</p>
<p>
Let’s get started with the basics:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8546136914-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Supervisor</span><span>

  </span><span>@worker</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span>
  </span><span>@registry</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Registry</span><span>
  </span><span>@supervisor</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.WorkerSupervisor</span></code></pre>
<p>
Our <code>Dashbit.Metrics</code> module is a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html"><code>Supervisor</code></a>, which will have two children: the registry and the supervisor of all workers. Since the workers are started dynamically, as requests come, we will use a <code>DynamicSupervisor</code>. We store the names of the worker, registry and dynamic supervisor processes in module attributes for convenience.</p>
<p>
Next we will define how our supervisor is started and its <code>init</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>start_link</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">(</span><span>_opts</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-2">do</span><span>

<p>
The <code>bump</code> function looks up in the registry if there is a process for the given path and returns its process identifier (<code>pid</code>). If one does not exist, we ask the worker supervisor to start a worker dynamically. We expect two possible outcomes from <code>start_child</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:ok, pid}</code> - the worker was started    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:error, {:already_started, pid}}</code> - a worker for the given <code>path</code> already exists    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
We need the second branch to address a potential race condition where two users may access a page for the first time at the same time. In this scenario, the <code>Registry.lookup/2</code> will fail for both them, and both will attempt to spawn the worker. One of them will succeed and the other will return the “already started” error. Once we find the <code>pid</code>, we send it the <code>:bump</code> message.</p>
<p>
We are almost there. There are just two steps left. …</p></article></div></div>

<br><h3>Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 1</h3><p><small>5/5/2020</small></p><p>

<img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/knightdragon.jpg"></p><p><i>This is the first post in a three part series. Check out <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html">part 3</a> when you are ready.</i></p>

<p>It is a beautiful day outside, so let's make a compiler. You don't need any knowledge of how compilers work to follow along. We are going to use Python to implement our own programming language, Teeny Tiny, that will compile to C code. It will take about 500 lines of code and provide the initial infrastructure needed to customize and extend the compiler into your own billion dollar production-ready compiler.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a series of posts that go step by step in building a working compiler. All of the source code can be found in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler">repo</a>. If you follow along with all the posts, I guesstimate that it will take you only a few hours.

</p><p>The Teeny Tiny language we are going to implement is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. The syntax is clean and simple. If you prefer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-like syntax then it will be trivial to modify the compiler at the end.  Here is an example program in our Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<pre>PRINT "How many fibonacci numbers do you want?"
INPUT nums

LET a = 0
LET b = 1
WHILE nums &gt; 0 REPEAT
    PRINT a
    LET c = a + b
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
    LET nums = nums - 1
ENDWHILE	
</pre>

<p>This program prints out terms of the fibonacci sequence based on the user's input: 0 1 1 2 3 5 13...</p>

<p>Our language will allow a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it will support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Numerical variables</li>
	<li>Basic arithmetic</li>
	<li>If statements</li>
	<li>While loops</li>
	<li>Print text and numbers</li>
	<li>Input numbers</li>
	<li>Labels and goto</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this is a standard subset of features, you may notice that there are no functions, no arrays, no way to read/write from a file, and not even an else statement. But with just this small set of constructs, you can actually do a lot. It will also setup the compiler in such a way that many other features will be straight forward to add later.</p>

<h4>Compiler Overview</h4>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/compilersteps.png"></p><p>Our compiler will follow a three step process that is illustrated above. First, given the inputted source code, it will break the code up into <i>tokens</i>. These are like words and punctuation in English. Second, it will <i>parse</i> the tokens to make sure they are in an order that is allowed in our language. Just like English sentences follow specific structures of verbs and nouns. Third, it will <i>emit</i> the C code that our language will translate to.</p>

<p>We will use these three steps as the main organization for our code. The lexer, parser, and emitter will each have their own Python code file. This tutorial is broken up into 3 parts based on these steps as well. If you were to extend the compiler, there are some additional steps you would add, but we will hold off on discussing those.</p>



<h4>Lexer Overview</h4>

<p>The first module of our compiler is called the <i>lexer</i>. Given a string of Teeny Tiny code, it will iterate character by character to do two things: decide where each token starts/stops and what type of token it is. If the lexer is unable to do this, then it will report an error for an invalid token.</p>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/tokens.png"></p><p>The figure demonstrates an example input and output of the lexer. Given the Teeny Tiny code, the lexer must determine where the tokens are along with the type (e.g., keyword). You can see that spaces aren't recognized as tokens, but the lexer will use them as one way to know when a token ends.</p>

<p>Let's finally get into some code, starting with the structure of the lexer in the file <b>lex.py</b>:</p>

<pre>class Lexer:
    def __init__(self, input):
        pass

    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        pass

    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        pass

    # Invalid token found, print error message and exit.
    def abort(self, message):
        pass
		
    # Skip whitespace except newlines, which we will use to indicate the end of a statement.
    def skipWhitespace(self):
        pass
		
    # Skip comments in the code.
    def skipComment(self):
        pass

    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        pass
</pre>

<p>I like to sketch out all the functions that I think I will need, then go back and fill them in. The function <b>getToken</b> will be the meat of the lexer. It will be called each time the compiler is ready for the next token and it will do the work of classifying tokens. <b>nextChar</b> and <b>peek</b> are helper functions for looking at the next character. <b>skipWhitespace</b> consumes the spaces and tabs that we don't care about. <b>abort</b> is what we will use to report an invalid token.</p>

<p>The lexer needs to keep track of the current position in the input string and the character at that position. We will initialize these in the constructor:</p>

<pre>    def __init__(self, input):
        self.source = input + '\n' # Source code to lex as a string. Append a newline to simplify lexing/parsing the last token/statement.
        self.curChar = ''   # Current character in the string.
        self.curPos = -1    # Current position in the string.
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>The lexer needs the input code and we append a newline to it (this just simplifies some checks later on). <b>curChar</b> is what the lexer will constantly check to decide what kind of token it is. Why not just do <i>source[curPos]</i>? Because that would litter the code with bounds checking. Instead we do this in <b>nextChar</b>:</p>

<pre>    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        self.curPos += 1
        if self.curPos &gt;= len(self.source):
            self.curChar = '\0'  # EOF
        else:
            self.curChar = self.source[self.curPos]
</pre>

<p>This increments the lexer's current position and updates the current character. If we reach the end of the input, set the character to the end-of-file marker. This is the only place we will modify curPos and curChar. But sometimes we want to look ahead to the next character without updating curPos:</p>

<pre>    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        if self.curPos + 1 &gt;= len(self.source):
            return '\0'
        return self.source[self.curPos+1]
</pre>

<p>We should make sure these functions work. Let's test them by create a new file <b>teenytiny.py</b>:</p>

<pre>from lex import *

def main():
	input = "LET foobar = 123"
	lexer = Lexer(input)

	while lexer.peek() != '\0':
		print(lexer.curChar)
		lexer.nextChar()

main()
</pre>

<p>Run this and the output should be every character of the input string, <i>LET foobar = 123</i>, on a new line:</p>

<pre>L
E 
T 

f 
o 
o 
b 
a 
r 

= 

1 
2 
3 

</pre>

<h4>Classifying Tokens</h4>

<p>But we don't just want characters, we want tokens! We need to plan how combining individual characters together makes a token, which works much like a state machine. Here are the main lexer rules for the Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operator. One or two consecutive characters that matches: + - * / = == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=</li>
	<li>String. Double quotation followed by zero or more characters and a double quotation. Such as: "hello, world!" and ""</li>
	<li>Number. One or more numeric characters followed by an optional decimal point and one or more numeric characters. Such as: 15 and 3.14</li>
	<li>Identifier. An alphabetical character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.</li>
	<li>Keyword. Exact text match of: LABEL, GOTO, PRINT, INPUT, LET, IF, THEN, ENDIF, WHILE, REPEAT, ENDWHILE</li>
</ul>

<p>Next we will start our <b>getToken</b> function in our <b>Lexer</b> class:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            pass	# Plus token.
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            pass	# Minus token.
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            pass	# Asterisk token.
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            pass	# Slash token.
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            pass	# Newline token.
        elif self.curChar == '\0':
            pass	# EOF token.
        else:
            # Unknown token!
            pass
			
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>This will detect a few possible tokens, but doesn't do anything useful yet. What we need next is a <b>Token</b> class to keep track of what type of token it is and the exact text from the code. Place this in <b>Lex.py</b> for now:</p>

<pre># Token contains the original text and the type of token.
class Token:   
    def __init__(self, tokenText, tokenKind):
        self.text = tokenText   # The token's actual text. Used for identifiers, strings, and numbers.
        self.kind = tokenKind   # The TokenType that this token is classified as.
</pre>

<p>To specify what type a token is, we will create the <b>TokenType</b> class as an enum. It looks long, but it just specifies every possible token our language allows. Add <i>import enum</i> to the top of <b>Lex.py</b> and add this class:</p>

<pre># TokenType is our enum for all the types of tokens.
class TokenType(enum.Enum):
	EOF = -1
	NEWLINE = 0
	NUMBER = 1
	IDENT = 2
	STRING = 3
	# Keywords.
	LABEL = 101
	GOTO = 102
	PRINT = 103
	INPUT = 104
	LET = 105
	IF = 106
	THEN = 107
	ENDIF = 108
	WHILE = 109
	REPEAT = 110
	ENDWHILE = 111
	# Operators.
	EQ = 201  
	PLUS = 202
	MINUS = 203
	ASTERISK = 204
	SLASH = 205
	EQEQ = 206
	NOTEQ = 207
	LT = 208
	LTEQ = 209
	GT = 210
	GTEQ = 211
</pre>

<p>Now we can expand <b>getToken</b> to actually do something when it detects a specific token:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        token = None

        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.PLUS)
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.MINUS)
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.ASTERISK)
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.SLASH)
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            token = …</pre></div></div></div>

  <p><span>Jul 15, 2020</span></p><p>Picture this: you’ve stumbled across the vulnerability of the year. You figured out how to gain access to any verified Twitter user’s account: Joe Biden, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, XXXTentacion, Apple, you name it. That was step 1 of your evil plan. What should step 2 be?</p>

<p>Maybe you log into the president’s account and post a fake tweet about launching missiles to North Korea. I’m not convinced that you can start a world war just by sending out a few fake tweets, but for the sake of argument let’s say that you can. But you’re not interested in watching the world burn anyway; no, your goal is to <strong>make as much money as possible</strong>. What should you do?</p>

<p>The people who carried out today’s Twitter hack had one answer: post variants of the message “send 1 BTC to this address and I’ll send 2 BTC back”  on famous accounts, and then (here’s the kicker) <em>don’t actually send 2 BTC back</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1594848885006-image.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>They managed to run off with a little over <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh?page=2">$100,000</a> before Twitter got the situation under control. Several people (on Twitter, on Hacker News, everywhere really) scoffed at this and claimed that they would have done something much more interesting with this kind of power. Let’s explore some of their ideas to see if we really can do better.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="stock-market-manipulation">Stock Market Manipulation</h2>

<p>This is the first thing that comes to most people’s minds. It sounds easy: buy a bunch of Tesla stock, log into Elon Musk’s account, tweet “Taking $TSLA private at $2000,” and sell in the time between the rise in price and when Musk/Twitter/the whole world realizes the hack.</p>

<p>This requires a fair amount of capital to buy the underlying stock, which the hacker may not have had, but there are other options: maybe you short the stock and then tweet (fake) damaging information about Tesla’s new line of cars. Maybe you just short Twitter’s own stock, which will surely take a huge hit in the market tomorrow (the hack was executed after trading hours).</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">oh lol i'd buy HTZ, that's the trade. "i've decided that Tesla will buy Hertz out of bankruptcy at $69 per share and make its fleet entirely self-driving," i'd be a billionaire and Money Stuff would end on the highest possible note</p>— Matt Levine (@matt_levine) <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1283503080978489344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>The big issue with all of these is that it’s very difficult to participate in the stock market anonymously. The SEC has all sorts of monitoring in place to catch more common forms of insider trading and fraud and you can guarantee that they would conduct a long, thorough investigation into a hypothetical hack-based market fraud. Unlike Bitcoin transactions, wire transfers and stock purchases can be reversed after the fact, and the exposure and risk go way up when you’re actually working with US dollars.</p>

<h2 id="blackmail">Blackmail</h2>

<p>The hackers got <em>full access</em> to all Twitter-verified accounts, meaning that they should have had access to their direct messages. Surely this is much more valuable than just posting a fake tweet? Think about the incalculable damage caused by the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/the-untold-story-of-the-sony-hack">Sony leaks</a> or watch this hypothetical-but-still-terrifying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4GB_NDU43Q">Tom Scott video</a> about a world in which Gmail password-checking was turned off for a day.</p>

<p>It’s definitely true that there are gobs of interesting material lurking in verified users’s DMs that they wouldn’t want seeing the light of day, but it’s a little tricky to make money from this. The most obvious method is blackmail. Exfiltrate the messages from the most popular users and threaten that you’ll release them in full if they don’t send X BTC to Y address.</p>

<p>This would definitely make some amount of money, but I’m not convinced it’s worth the effort. Firstly, it’s hard to judge ahead of time which accounts have the juicy DMs. Large, high-profile accounts like Joe Biden’s are run by a whole social media team and probably don’t exchange sensitive information via Twitter. Smaller accounts probably do have more interesting gossip, but might be less willing or able to pay as a result.</p>

<p>Then there’s the problem of actually exfiltrating and storing all the data, sending individual messages to each of the users you hack, tracking who has and hasn’t paid, and actually releasing the leaked material publicly. It’s a lot of operational overhead that may, in the end, net you less money than the dumb Bitcoin scam.</p>

<h2 id="sell-it-on-the-dark-web">Sell it on the dark web</h2>

<p>Leave aside the challenge of actually finding a buyer (you can’t just make a post on a forum, the Feds read the dark web too). How much should a buyer be willing to pay you for this bug? Either the buyer is planning to monetize the exploit for more than $100k (the whole point of this post is to prove that that’s really hard!), or the buyer wants to use the exploit for other purposes, like surveillance or intelligence gathering.</p>

<p>This isn’t out of the question. Countries spy on each other all the time, and I’m sure that China would love to be able to read the DMs of journalists or Hong Kong activists. The issue is that this particular exploit wasn’t terribly suited to the business of long-term surveillance. Logging into the account required actually the email associated with it and triggering a password reset (that somehow also bypassed 2FA). The password reset triggered a notification email to the original address on file, which basically announced the account takeover. The hacker had a matter of hours before the whole world knew about the vulnerability.</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies want <em>persistent</em> access, and they want to surveil without their targets learning that they were surveilled. This exploit wouldn’t have accomplished that.</p>

<h2 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h2>

<p>Now we’re getting somewhere… Large companies <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/05/31/hacker-finds-huge-apple-security-hole-apple-pays-100000-bug-bounty/#576388b36894">routinely</a> pay out vast sums of money to white hat hackers reporting flaws that are less damaging than this one. Even if Twitter wouldn’t pay out 100% as much money as was made via the Bitcoin scam, bug bounty programs have the added benefit of being 100% legal, which should change the risk calculus significantly. So why didn’t our hacker take this route?</p>

<p>One theory is that if the hacker was already a known criminal, it’s tricky to collect the bug bounty payout without revealing their identity to Twitter, which might still end them up in some trouble. I’m not sure I buy this (can’t they just use a third party?).</p>

<p>More plausibly, perhaps Twitter wouldn’t actually have paid out $100k?</p>

<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr">🤔 <a href="https://t.co/I902KoaZwe">pic.twitter.com/I902KoaZwe</a></p>— LiveOverflow 🔴 (@LiveOverflow) <a href="https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow/status/1283511782380908545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>This tweet suggests that OAuth takeovers were valued at $7.7k (and after taxes you’re left with chump change). If so, this a big issue with Twitter’s bug bounty program! You need to ensure that the incentives make reporting more worth it than exploiting.</p>

<p><em>Update: more reporting about how the account takeovers were executed <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos">has emerged</a>, and it suggests that there wasn’t any technical vulnerability that was ever exploited. Social engineering and insider risk (which can obviously be quite damaging) tend not to be eligible for bounties on most programs.</em></p>

<h2 id="phishing">Phishing</h2>

<p>OK how about this: log into Coinbase’s twitter account, craft a tweet announcing some snazzy new feature and include a bit.ly link that actually goes to a phishing website. Execute a <a href="https://fortenf.org/e/2018/05/29/coinbase-phishing.html">relay phishing attack</a> that gives you access to their Coinbase account while bypassing 2FA, and then send all their Bitcoin and Ethereum and Dogecoin to your own account.</p>

<p>There are a few flaws, but most are surmountable with some effort. First, Twitter would probably take down the tweet pretty fast, so you’d probably want to target several different accounts of famous cryptocurrency enthusiasts (not just Coinbase). Second, bit.ly would probably disable that specific URL and Google would definitely add the phishing site to their <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a> list (which is shared by all major browsers). This would result in big scary red warning banners appearing before users could access your site. Also, whatever registrar you purchased your domain from would probably revoke it.</p>

<p>OK, so instead of having one phishing site and one domain and one URL you’d want to set up several of these in advance and hop from one to the other as each gets taken down by various actors in turn. This would probably work! Would it net you more than $100k? Maybe?! It’s hard to say and probably depends a lot on luck and timing. The people with the most cryptocurrency in their Coinbase accounts are probably the least likely to fall for this kind of thing in the first place, so it’s unclear how much more money you’d make than the dumb 2-for-1 scam, but still, it might be worth it in case you manage to compromise an account with huge reserves.</p>

<p>Still, all this requires some legitimately difficult software engineering work and the whole point of this was to make easy money! I understand that today’s attack was almost painfully lame in its execution, but it really may have been the smartest choice tactically.</p>

<p>This is not to say that they did everything right: I still can’t explain why they seem to have used only 1 BTC address throughout the process (Coinbase and other exchanges quickly blocked transactions to this address), and the wording on some of their tweets was stilted and awkward (surely they could have paid for a Grammarly subscription). But in the end, I think there’s no evidence that the twitter posts were just a “cover” for the real attack or that this hack had anything to do with a foreign government. I think this tweet sums it up well:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">High impact bugs can sometimes be found and exploited by anyone, even dogs who have no idea what to do with the car they caught. There really doesn't have to be more to it than that.</p>— Brad Hill (@hillbrad) <a href="https://twitter.com/hillbrad/status/1283597241685438464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Metallurgists</strong></p>
<p>I have enjoyed writing many articles about the history of different knife steels over the past couple years of this website. It has been very challenging to track down the history of different steels to see where they came from and how. I decided to write an article about some of the greats who have made contributions to knife steel and knife tests. Many of these metallurgists didn’t know they were developing steels that would be used in knives. Some were developing tool steels or high speed steels. However, their steels have since been used in knives or their steel designs influenced other steels which have been used in knives. To keep this article manageable in size I have focused on those that developed steel or tests of knives. In other words, those that studied different aspects of steel are not included. Some notable people that were omitted for this reason include:</p>
<p>1) Marcus Grossman and Edgar Bain who discovered bainite and wrote a couple influential books on steel metallurgy</p>
<p>2) Many metallurgists who are less directly applicable but discovered many fundamentals of steel and general metallurgy, such as Henry Clifton Sorby (microscopy), Dmitry Chernov (phase transitions in steel), and William Roberts-Austen (iron-carbon phase diagram).</p>
<p>3) Metallurgists who studied heat treatment techniques. Taylor and White in the list below are a possible exception to this, however.</p>
<p>4) Influential teachers of metallurgy, some even directly to knifemakers like Kevin Cashen. Some on this list are also known for their teaching, but make the list primarily for other specific contributions.</p>
<p>So that list of categories may mean that some people you may think of as great metallurgists did not make the list. However, even with those omissions I think you will find some interesting information about the contributions of certain individuals and groups that developed the steel products we use in knives today.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Forester Mushet</strong></p>
<p>Mushet developed the first tool steel in 1868 which had several important characteristics. One was that it was the first commercially produced “alloy steel” meaning it had intentional alloy additions including manganese and tungsten to achieve certain properties, rather than being a simple carbon steel. The high tungsten in the steel gave it very high wear resistance for longer tool life. It was also the first “air hardening” steel meaning it could be allowed to cool in air from high temperature rather than quenching in oil or water. This steel was the basis of experiments from Taylor and White that led to the development of high speed steels and the explosion of development in other tool steels. Mushet is actually better known for making improvements to the “Bessemer process” which allowed the production of steel at much lower costs. But for his contributions to the future of knife steel his “Mushet steel” is huge.

<p>Mushet</p>
<p><strong>Frederick Winslow Taylor and Maunsel White</strong></p>
<p>These Bethlehem Steel metallurgists started modern steel development in many ways. Prior to their contributions, steel was heat treated in a fairly narrow temperature range, such as 1400-1600°F. Overheating would lead to grain growth and poor toughness. However, they discovered that when Mushet steel was heated to very high temperatures prior to quenching, that it could last much longer as a high speed tool, because it maintained high hardness at high speeds and therefore high temperatures. Their discovery of “high speed steel” was presented at the 1900 Paris Exhibition (a world’s fair) and led to a T1-type high speed steel by 1903. The knowledge developed and the excitement generated led to the development of many other tool steels.

<p>White</p>
<p><strong>Harry Brearley</strong></p>
<p>While there were several people working on inventing stainless steel in a similar time period, Brearley is credited with being the first to commercialize it. And what type of stainless steel did he commercialize? A knife steel! For several years afterward, stainless steel was known as being for knives and many people didn’t even realize it could be used for other things. The steel he developed was 420 stainless. This steel may have a relatively poor reputation among knife enthusiasts today, but it has been used in as many knives as any steel, perhaps the most used knife steel. And it has very good corrosion resistance. This steel was the basis for all future stainless knife steels, especially those like 420HC and AEB-L with the similar chromium content of 13%. The original name for S90V was 420V because the same chromium content of 420 was used in its development.

<p><strong>James P. Gill</strong></p>
<p>Gill was a metallurgist working for VASCO which is a company largely forgotten by knife collectors now, but made many significant contributions to tool steels. Gill developed the first commercially available high vanadium steels, such as the first 2% vanadium high speed steel in 1937 which evolved to become M2, and also M4 with its 4% vanadium and T15 with 5% vanadium. Many knife steels today continue to have high vanadium contents for improved wear resistance. Gill also wrote one of the first books on Tool Steels in 1934, which continued with new editions up until the 5th in 1998. These books on Tool Steels have been used by metallurgists for decades. Read more about James Gill in <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/04/16/the-development-of-first-tool-steels-book/">this article</a>.

<p><strong>John A. Mathews</strong></p>
<p>Mathews worked for Crucible and Halcomb steel in the early 1900s and was highly influential for his steel developments and contributions to steel research. He patented the original T1 high speed steel with a small vanadium addition which improved the properties of early high speed steels. Vanadium additions were basically unheard of at the time but became very popular for various uses afterward. Mathews also developed the first “oil-hardening” steels including the popular O1 in 1905 which continues to be used in knives today.

<p><strong>Harry Johnstin</strong></p>
<p>Johnstin developed the steels Vasco Wear and Vasco Die in 1964. Vasco Wear is probably better known now as CruWear (Crucible branding of the same steel), though it is known by many names such as PD#1, Lescowear, and Z-Wear. Vasco Wear saw use in knives by the 70s and continues to be a popular choice in its various versions. A relatively unknown fact is that CPM-3V is in fact a powder metallurgy version of Vasco Die. Surprisingly, Crucible metallurgists were able to patent the powder metallurgy of Vasco Die despite the composition being previously patented (and expired), because the change to the microstructure and properties were deemed to be significant enough. Vasco Die and Vasco Wear also created the “8% Cr” tool steel category which became future steels like Vanadis 4 (before Vanadis 4 Extra), Vanadis 10, Sleipner, A8 Mod, DC53, Z-Tuff, CD#1, and others. You can read more about these steels in <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/06/03/the-history-of-3v-cru-wear-and-z-tuff-steel/">this article</a>.</p>

<p><strong>David J. Giles</strong></p>
<p>David Giles was a metallurgist who developed many tool steels for Latrobe steel. Giles developed several steels which have seen use in knives, including 440A in 1926 [1]. 440A has been used extensively in consumer knives ever since, and served as the basis for the higher carbon 440C, which was incredibly popular in production and custom knives in the 70s and 80s, and continues to be used today. 154CM was originally called “440C Mod” because they reduced the Cr in 440C and replaced it with Mo. Read more about 154CM history <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/05/21/154cm-development-properties-legacy/">in this article</a>. This 17-19% Cr base&nbsp; composition of 440A/440C served as the starting point for many future steels such as Elmax and S60V. Giles also developed 4-5% vanadium cold work steels A7 and D7 (as opposed to Gill who developed high speed steels) which served as a basis for future steels like CPM-10V. The patent-holder of 10V, Walter Haswell, previously worked at Latrobe steel and was a co-patent holder on several vanadium steels there as well, which used the same carbon-vanadium ratio equations that Giles had previously proposed [2]. D7 became Bohler’s powder metallurgy K190, which was further modified to <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/06/15/what-is-the-best-budget-knife-steel/">develop the popular stainless M390</a>.</p>

<p>Giles</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth Pinnow and William Stasko</strong></p>
<p>These two metallurgists were prolific tool steel patenters in the 1990s and developed several significant knife steels. One is CPM-3V, previously mentioned under Harry Johnstin. They also developed S90V [3], which is popular in knives in its own right but also led to S110V which is essentially a modified S90V, developed by Al Kajinic. The biggest contribution of S90V was the discovery that using 14% Cr (as opposed to 17-18% Cr in earlier steels like S60V and Elmax), led to a better utilization of vanadium additions for improved properties. This led to a “14% Cr plus vanadium” basis for several future Crucible steels like S30V. The S90V patent also lays out how they explored different levels of nitrogen in S90V, which wasn’t really utilized in the final composition, but increased nitrogen (~0.15-0.20%) was used in S30V, S110V, and S45VN. Pinnow and Stasko also patented CPM-15V which continues to be one of the highest wear resistance steels available [4]. Stasko was also co-listed with Andrzej Wojcieszynski for patenting CPM Rex 86 and CPM Rex 121 steels [5].</p>

<p><strong>Dick Barber</strong></p>
<p>Barber is best known for developing CPM-S30V steel, which has been one of the most popular steels used in high end production knives for nearly two decades. S30V was the first steel produced by Crucible to have an intentionally increased nitrogen content of about 0.20%. S30V also served as the starting point for the popular <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/13/s35vn-steel-properties-and-how-to-heat-treat/">S35VN</a>, and the more recent <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/15/spyderco-exclusive-cpm-spy27-steel-analysis/">SPY27</a> and <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/11/01/crucible-s45vn-steel/">S4…</a></p></div></div>

<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/16102948y9dIHsQN-2.png"></p><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Zulip Server 3.0 contains major visual design improvements, dramatic scalability and performance improvements, a new logo, and several of Zulip's most requested features to help users efficiently read, skim, search, and refer back to their messages. Zulip is 100% free and open-source software, and ships with translations for 16 languages.</p><p>Zulip 3.0 is our largest release ever, with over 4100 new commits since December's Zulip 2.1 release. A total of 110 people contributed commits to Zulip 3.0, bringing <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/">the Zulip server project</a> to 619 distinct code contributors. With <a href="https://zulip.com/team">54 people</a> who’ve contributed 100+ commits, Zulip has by far the most active open-source development community of any team chat software.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who's contributed to Zulip over the last few months, whether by writing code and docs, reporting issues, testing changes, translating, posting feedback on <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html">chat.zulip.org</a>, or just suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving back to the Zulip community.</p><h2 id="project-highlights"><strong>Project highlights</strong></h2><p>Today marks a release of the Zulip server, but lots of exciting work has happened outside the server codebase over the last several months as well. Highlights include:</p><ul><li>Zulip has experienced an extraordinary increase in usage in 2020 as a result of the ongoing pandemic changing how people work. &nbsp;It's been incredibly gratifying to <a href="https://monadical.com/posts/how-to-make-remote-work-part-two-zulip.html">hear from users</a> about how Zulip has helped them make remote work, conferences, teaching, and meetups successful. &nbsp;We now sponsor free Zulip Cloud Standard hosting for hundreds of worthy <a href="https://zulip.com/for/open-source/">open-source projects</a>, non-profits, <a href="https://zulip.com/for/research/">research groups</a>, and similar non-commercial organizations. &nbsp;New organizations can apply during the <a href="https://zulip.com/new">signup flow</a> or on the billing page.</li><li>Zulip Cloud has introduced <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2020/05/27/zulip-responds-to-pandemic-with-60-day-free-trial/">60-day free trials</a> for commercial users to help ensure that budget freezes aren't a barrier to experimenting with Zulip. &nbsp;Zulip has robust data import tools for <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack">Slack</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-mattermost">Mattermost</a>, and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-gitter">Gitter</a>.</li><li>Zulip has a new logo! Constructed from two chat bubbles that together form a Z (with a second Z in the negative space between them!), it replaces our aging “green Z inside a circle” logo created in 2013.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1000w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li>Our primary domain is now <a href="https://zulip.com/">https://zulip.com</a>. We’ll be migrating organizations from <code>subdomain.zulipchat.com</code> to <code>subdomain.zulip.com</code> in the coming weeks, taking care to avoid breaking existing API integrations and permalinks.</li><li>The Zulip mobile apps for iOS and Android have fixed numerous bugs and gained features like displaying math formulas with LaTeX—a frequently requested feature for the many organizations who do machine learning or other work best expressed in the language of mathematics.</li><li>We’re having an excellent <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4652389204754432/">Google Summer of Code</a> this year, with 18 amazing students spending their summer working on Zulip. Many of the features advertised here and in our full changelog were built by current GSoC students or alumni of the program.</li></ul><h2 id="release-highlights"><strong>Release highlights</strong></h2><p>Because this is such a huge release, just listing the hundreds of important changes in this release makes our <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/changelog.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">changelog</a> incredibly long. Here are just some highlights:</p><p><strong>Core user experience</strong></p><ul><li>Added <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/rename-a-topic" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">support for moving topics (or messages within topics) between streams</a>. This was by far our most requested feature.</li><li>Redesigned the top navbar/search area to be much cleaner and show stream descriptions. This was our second most requested feature, and removes what had been Zulip’s most visible UI wart.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1E7A3465D8563B08C899BE809773AB4DB2AEE627A10B56FB07707A14E1AA0EC0_1594859150872_image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Stream descriptions can contain Zulip markdown such as links, emoji, and even LaTeX!</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Added “Recent Topics”, a useful new interface for browsing conversations. Feedback so far has been extremely positive, and we plan to make a version of this the default view in Zulip Server 4.0.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png 600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png 891w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li>Essentially every widget in the Zulip UI received significant polish work in this release.</li></ul><p><strong>Message formatting</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip has an innovative new feature for scheduling meetings with global participants. Instead of doing gymnastics to clearly communicate a meeting time to an audience across the globe, you can <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#mention-a-time" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">use a date picker to write a time</a> which Zulip will show in each reader’s own timezone.</li><li>Zulip’s markup now supports <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#spoilers" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">spoiler blocks</a>.</li><li><a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/quote-and-reply" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Quote-and-reply</a> now generates a handy link to the referenced message.</li></ul><p><strong>Server</strong></p><ul><li>This release adds support for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, and ends support for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and Debian 9 Stretch (both of which were based on Python 3.5, which reaches EOL in September). See our documentation for <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrading the operating system</a>.</li><li>Zulip now defaults to using PostgreSQL 12 on new installs, with support for PostgreSQL 10–12. (Previously, Zulip always used whatever PostgreSQL version came with the base OS release.) This release also adds a convenient new tool to <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-postgresql" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrade </a><a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">PostgreSQL</a>.</li><li>Numerous major performance improvements. Zulip’s server-to-client push system scales 4x better than in Zulip 2.x, and several of the most common queries are much faster. Performance has improved dramatically for organizations like our own Zulip development community with 10,000s of user accounts.</li><li>We upgraded Django from 1.11.x to the latest LTS series, 2.2.x. We continue to love how every major Django release comes with great features that we hadn't realized we needed!</li><li>We're moving to a new versioning scheme with only 2 digits; the next maintenance release will be Zulip Server 3.1 and the next major release will be Zulip Server 4.0.</li></ul><p><strong>API and API Documentation</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip’s <a href="https://zulip.com/api" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">REST API documentation</a> received a major overhaul both of content and presentation. Most importantly, our automated tests now validate every API request, response, and example against the OpenAPI schemas used to generate the API documentation. Because the Zulip server has nearly 100% test coverage, this ensures the API documentation is always consistent with the implementation.</li><li>Zulip now has <a href="https://zulip.com/api/changelog" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a detailed API changelog</a> which documents exactly when each API change was introduced. The <code>zulip_feature_level</code> field in <a href="https://zulipchat.com/api/get-server-settings" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">the server settings API</a> (which is more fine-grained than a server release), when combined with the changelog, allows client applications to know exactly what any given Zulip server supports. This should make it easier for developers (including developers of the official desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) to write full-featured client apps directly off of the API documentation, without needing to investigate server internals.</li><li>Documenting the API provided a natural audit of Zulip’s API for obscure quirks and mistakes that would be better cleaned up than documented. As a result, this release contains dozens of changes to the Zulip API, which had previously been quite stable for years. Because of careful backwards-compatibility work, these shouldn’t cause any disruption (Zulip mobile app releases from 6 months ago work unmodified against this release!)</li></ul><p><strong>Integrations</strong></p><ul><li>New external authentication method integrations: <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#plug-and-play-sso-google-github-gitlab" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#sign-in-with-apple" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Sign in with Apple</a>.</li><li>The Zulip desktop apps now do social authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.) via an external browser, which improves security and provides a more pleasant single sign-on experience.</li><li>Added <a href="https://www.zulipchat.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a new incoming webhook API</a> that accepts messages in the format used by Slack’s incoming webhooks API. This means that some third-party products that integrate with Slack but don’t have a generic outgoing-webhook feature can now easily integrate with Zulip.</li><li><a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/authentication-methods.html#saml" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Zulip’s popular SAML integration</a> now supports login initiated from the SAML Identity Provider.</li><li>BigBlueButton joins Jitsi and Zoom as a supported video call provider. We also rewrote the Zoom integration to have a much better OAuth user experience. The Google Hangouts video call integration was removed due to Google Hangouts reaching end of life. (Its replacement, Google Meet, does not offer a similar API for third-party apps to create calls.)</li><li><a href="https://www.zulipchat.com/integrations/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">New native integrations</a> for ErrBit, Grafana, Thinkst Canary, and Prometheus Alertmanager, with improvements to the integrations for GitHub, GitLab, Sentry, Taiga, Semaphore, and many more.</li></ul><p><strong>Settings</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip now uses the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> CSS property to determine whether to default to the day theme or the popular night theme, based on the operating system’s theme.</li><li>Zulip’s notification settings UI has been redesigned around an intuitive table format, displaying all individual streams that have non-default settings. This makes it much easier to configure, and is also important preparation for upcoming features like subscribing to notifications on a topic.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1E7A3465D8563B08C899BE809773AB4DB2AEE627A10B56FB07707A14E1AA0EC0_1594859186960_image.png" alt=""></figure><ul><li>Added support for <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/message-retention-policy" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">programmable message retention policies</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>It’s hard to believe that its been more than 3 years since I opened <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2000">RFC 2000</a>, which defined
the const generics for Rust. At the same time, reading the RFC thread, there’s also been a huge
amount of change in this area: for one thing, at the time the RFC was written, const fns weren’t
stable, and consts weren’t even being evaluated using miri yet. There’s been a lot of work over the
years on the const generics feature, but still nothing has shipped. However, I think we have defined
a very useful subset of const generics which is stable enough to ship in the near term.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, <strong>const generics</strong> refers to generics that are constant values, rather
than types. This allows types to be parameterized by, for example, specific integer values. In
stable Rust, only the special array type - <code>[T; N]</code> - has a const parameter (the length of the
array), and there is no way to be abstract over all values of <code>N</code>, even for arrays. Const generics
will allow creating new types parameterized by values, as well as implementing traits and functions
that are abstract over those values. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// This is a custom type which is parameterized by a `usize`
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> 
</span><span>    </span><span>bytes</span>: <span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>],</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>// This is a trait which has been implemented for arrays of
</span><span>// any length.
</span><span></span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span>: <span>Debug</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Debug</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>We’ve been using the const generics feature to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html#implementations">implement traits for arrays</a> for over a
year, artificially limiting the implementations to arrays of length 32. We are planning to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74060">lift
that limitation on those impls</a> in an upcoming release. By stabilizing const
generics, we could start to allow external crates to implement traits for all arrays as well, and
many other interesting use cases. There will be two important limitations, however.</p>
<h2 id="only-integral-primitive-types-for-const-generics">Only integral primitive types for const generics</h2>
<p>The initial types that a const generic can have will be limited to the integral primitive types.
That means the signed and unsigned integer types, booleans, and chars. For now, no compound or
user-defined types will be allowed, and no references (meaning no strings as well). This is a
relatively easy shortcoming of the current implementation to fix, and user defined types for const
generics will be possible in the nearer, rather than longer term.</p>
<p>I want to mention, since a lot of people aren’t aware of this, that not <em>any</em> type can be used as a
const parameter, even setting aside the current limitations of rustc. Importantly, in order for
Rust’s type system to be sound, equality between two types must be deterministic, reflexive,
symmetric, and so on. That is, if your custom type implements equality by flipping a coin, two
values of that type will sometimes be equal to one another and sometimes not. This will mean, two
types parameterized by those values will sometimes be the same type and sometimes a different type.
This would be quite troubling for the type system.</p>
<p>(As a concrete example, floating point numbers present challenges with the fact that <code>Foo&lt;NaN&gt;</code>, for
example, would not be considered the same type as itself, because <code>NaN</code> is not equal to itself.)</p>
<p>The long term solution to this is a notion of “structural equality,” which is a strictly correct
subset of <code>Eq</code> types that meet the properties needed for use in the type system. Rust already uses
this structural equality property when implementing matching. If you derive Eq and PartialEq for
your type and all its members, it should meet the structural equality property needed to be used in
matches and const generics.</p>
<h2 id="no-complex-expressions-based-on-generic-types-or-consts">No complex expressions based on generic types or consts</h2>
<p>The other limitation will be that only two kinds of expressions can be used to fill in a const
generic position:</p>
<ol>
<li>A const generic parameter. For example, in an <code>impl&lt;const N: usize&gt;</code>, where an const generic has
been introduced, that value can be used literally to fill a const generic.</li>
<li>An expression that can be used in a const context which does not depend on any type or const
parameters. This means literals, math equations, using consts, calling const fns, etc, as long
as no free generics are involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>This limits a lot of the more exotic and interesting things users want to do with const generics.
You can’t, for example, combine two array lengths together to form an array with type
<code>[T; N + M]</code>, or even double an array length with <code>[T; N * 2]</code>. You basically can’t have a type
that depends on computation that depends on other generics. Implementing this behavior soundly and
correctly is really the hard part of implementing const generics, and while work is ongoing, it
isn’t ready yet.</p>
<p>This also means that const generics can’t be filled in based on associated types, associated consts,
or generic methods. No functions that return <code>[u8; mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;()]</code>, no use of <code>Self</code> like
<code>[u8; Self::LEN]</code>, etc.</p>
<p>This will mean, for example, that use cases like cryptographic hash traits which allow each
implementation to specify a different length for the hash they output will still be out of scope for
the MVP. This is a shame, but this feature will come eventually.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-be-able-to-do">What you <em>will</em> be able to do</h2>
<p>All of these restrictions might sound like the feature is pretty limited, but I think users will
find a lot of really powerful use cases for it once they can play around with it. For one thing,
traits that today might be implemented only by some array types, or not at all, will begin to be
implemented by all arrays, making arrays a much more first class part of the language. And <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74373">we’re
already finding awesome use cases</a>. Look at this code sample.</p>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Based on the <em>pattern</em> passed to the map function, the compiler figures out that the first call to
<code>array_chunks</code> should chunk the data into an iterator of arrays with length 2, and in the second
call it should be an iterator of arrays with length 3. It’s so cool!</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve worked out what we could stabilize in the near future, I am working up hype and
consensus aroud the vision of stabilizing this feature - that’s what this blog post is for! The next
steps will be for someone to carve out a feature gate which is this limited set of const generics
(as opposed to the existing whole <code>const_generics</code> feature gate) and then for us to go through the

<p>My own involvement in const generics between the RFC and now has been minimal to non-existent.
Essentially, my role (both in the RFC and now) has been to identify a scope we can get consensus on
moving forward with. However, the hard work of implementing const generics has been going on for
years in between then, and I want to credit especially the contributors <a href="http://github.com/eddyb">eddyb</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/varkor">varkor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lcnr">lcnr</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oli-obk">oli-obk</a> for their work on implementing this highly
requested feature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>After Jenna discovered</strong> that her boyfriend was cheating on her, she went into an emotional tailspin. She was â€˜crying all the timeâ€™, struggled to attend her university classes, slept a lot and avoided situations she normally enjoyed.</p><p>In recounting her emotional reaction, Jenna stressed to me its unreasonableness. Given that she and her boyfriend hadnâ€™t been dating for long, she felt that she shouldnâ€™t have been so upset. After a month, she decided that something was seriously amiss and that she needed professional help. She recalled her psychiatrist diagnosing depression and telling her the problem might be caused by a chemical imbalance in her brain, for which she was prescribed an antidepressant.</p><p>Jenna found her emotional reactions jarring. They defied her basic assumptions about herself as confident, mature and self-sufficient. She told me she welcomed the diagnosis of a neurobiological disorder, which confirmed her problem was â€˜realâ€™ â€“ brought on by a physiological force external to her volition â€“ and that it showed sheâ€™s not â€˜just a slackerâ€™.</p><p>At the same time, Jenna was careful to distance her experience from that of people who are, in her words, â€˜crazyâ€™ or â€˜nutsâ€™. Their illness means a loss of control and ability to function. By contrast, she sees her problem as a common and minor glitch in neurochemistry. No one, she insisted, should mistake her for the mentally ill.</p><p>Jenna was one of 80 diverse volunteers that a research team at the University of Virginia and I interviewed in Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and two small cities in central Virginia. We wanted to find out how people deal with common forms of psychological distress and challenging circumstances, such as: shyness and nervousness in social situations; underperformance at work or school; struggles after the loss of a significant relationship; and disappointment with how their lives are unfolding. A majority of our interviewees had received some form of psychotherapy and/or been diagnosed with a condition such as depression, social anxiety disorder or attention deficit disorder, and prescribed a psychiatric medication.</p><p>It was striking that many (though not all) at least partly explained their distress in terms of biological causes, particularly a neurochemical imbalance. Yet thinking of their problems in this way was a fraught process. Like Jenna, many interviewees sharply distinguished themselves from the mentally ill and cast the mentally ill in a very negative light. This stigmatising of people with serious mental illness wasnâ€™t based on any first-hand experiences; rather, it was motivated by a desire to protect their own dignity and social standing. To justify the distinction between their own situation and mental illness, our interviewees rejected the idea that they had an â€˜illnessâ€™ as such, detached themselves from any formal diagnosis using statements such as â€˜thatâ€™s what the doctor calls itâ€™ or, in some cases, they avoided seeking medical help altogether.</p><p>For people like Jenna, who embraced a neurobiological explanation for their problems, this created a conundrum, which many of them resolved by creating a separate classification for their own experience â€“ what I have called a â€˜third conditionâ€™. The people we spoke to did not give this â€˜conditionâ€™ a name or explicit meaning. Rather it emerged in the rhetorical space opened up by the way they framed their personal struggle, distinguishing it from mental illness, on the one hand, and normality, on the other.</p><p><strong>Consider the perspective</strong> of another of our interviewees, a young woman Iâ€™ll call Piper, who had been diagnosed with depression. When â€˜you think mental illnessâ€™, according to Piper, â€˜you think schizophrenia and crazy people, and Iâ€™m not crazy, I just get really nervous.â€™ In making this distinction, interviewees like Piper and Jenna not only claimed that they were less impaired than the seriously mentally ill, they also insisted that their experience was categorially different. Piper said of herself that biologically something is just â€˜a little offâ€™. She has â€˜too little or too much or whatever it is that makes you have these issuesâ€™. Distinct from â€˜crazy peopleâ€™, she has control over her mind and her story. All she needs is a little pill. Yet at the same time, her â€˜conditionâ€™ is also different from the mundane challenges that normal people might face. Piper was adamant that her nervousness in social situations is different from ordinary shyness. Her taking of medication is warranted. She has a third condition caused by an â€˜imbalanceâ€™.</p><p>The â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ </p><p>To reconcile their perspective with the fact that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, many interviewees credited a medical professional or a confidant for suggesting something like this third condition idea to them. Others emphasised the ordinariness of their experience and compared it to the types of routine problems that regular physicians treat. As one interviewee put it, â€˜all you have to do is take a pillâ€™.</p><p>There are echoes here of the messages conveyed in direct-to-consumer advertising for psychiatric medication. Iâ€™ve analysed the content of these adverts and found that distress, as listed in symptoms and portrayed in the patientsâ€™ stories, is often presented as a â€˜real medical conditionâ€™ and yet unlike mental illness. The ads contain no references to psychiatrists or to the diagnostic manual of mental disorders from the American Psychiatric Association (APA), nor use of phrases such as â€˜mental illnessâ€™ or â€˜mental disorderâ€™, and no depictions of those affected as anything but productive and successful citizens. In the words of our interviewees and in the advertising messages, the â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ against whom the implicit comparisons are being drawn.</p><p>The views we encountered in our interviews are consistent with national surveys of public opinion about mental health. Today, with respect to mental health problems, the lay public much more freely endorses biological causes, the seeking of medical help and the use of psychoactive medications than in the past. Their views have converged with the biological perspectives long promoted in public campaigns to reduce the stigma of mental illness. According to the American anti-stigma organisation Bring Change to Mind, for instance: â€˜The fact is, a mental illness is a disorder of the brain â€“ your bodyâ€™s most important organ.â€™ Among anti-stigma researchers and activists, the evolution in public attitudes toward biological psychiatry has been celebrated as a sign that the public has at long last become â€˜literateâ€™, with a â€˜more scientificâ€™ even â€˜sophisticatedâ€™ understanding of mental illness.</p><p>In promoting a biogenetic causal theory, anti-stigma campaigners â€“ as well as psychiatrists, the popular media, and others â€“ hoped to convince people that mental illnesses are â€˜just likeâ€™ other chronic physical ailments, such as â€˜heart disease or diabetesâ€™, to <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-mental-illness" target="_blank">quote</a> the APA, and could be medically addressed. This approach would, in turn, alleviate mental illness stigma and foster tolerance by reducing the (allegedly common) tendency to hold sufferers responsible for their condition. The result, it was confidently believed, would promote treatment optimism and increased help-seeking.</p><p>But something unexpected happened. The public embrace of neurobiology has not led to a more benevolent orientation toward the mentally ill. Rather, according to an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409431/" target="_blank">editorial</a> in the <em>Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience</em> in 2015, â€˜well-conducted studies have concluded, almost uniformlyâ€™ that the stigma-reduction strategy of recent decades, informed by â€˜biogenetic attribution of all mental disordersâ€™, has â€˜not only not worked, but also may have worsened public attitudes and behaviour toward those with mental illnessesâ€™. Such studies have shown that the growing endorsement of biological causation has continued to exacerbate the stigmatising of mental illness among the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/biogenetic-explanations-and-public-acceptance-of-mental-illness-systematic-review-of-population-studies/E6078EED07031B5828DB84FCDC90657F" target="_blank">general public</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20493559/" target="_blank">patients</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/17786" target="_blank">professionals</a>.</p><p>What accounts for this paradoxical result?</p><p><strong>I believe that </strong>our interviews reveal a crucial reason. While people accepted a neurobiological explanation for their problems, they struggled against the dehumanising notion that their thoughts, feelings or behaviour were mechanistically <em>caused.</em> Drawing on clinicians, drug ads and the popular media, the caricature of the seriously mentally ill served as a pivotal image by which to contrast and affirm their own control and self-determination. Millions of Americans â€“ and countless others in Western countries â€“ likely find themselves sharing this or a similar perspective.</p><p>The idea that oneâ€™s distress is primarily caused by a neurochemical deficiency that can be corrected by a drug is a fiction</p><p>As I argue in my <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo48408677.html" target="_blank">book</a> <em>Chemically Imbalanced</em> (2020), to defeat this othering and reduce stigma, clinical practice needs to move away from biogenetic causal language. Psychiatric research doesnâ€™t support the notion of simple cause and effect in mental health, instead uncovering a far more complex and indeterminate picture of vulnerabilities. There is no evidence to justify the continued promotion of one-dimensional theories such as â€˜chemical imbalanceâ€™. Nor does the beneficial use of psychiatric medicines require it. In fact, their precise mechanism of action and relation to troublesome experience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00407/full" target="_blank">remains</a> a mystery. It would be more truthful for mental health professionals and public health campaigns to acknowledge this.</p><p>Itâ€™s true, as interviewees such as Jenna made clear, that patients often find biogenetic language appealing. It provides a way to establish their suffering as both tangible and unfeigned, and it offers a simple account and positive prognosis for their struggles. However, the …</p></div></div></div>

            <figure><img src="https://cdn.spark.app/media/bostata/image/blog_w720.png" alt="blog"></figure><p>Two years ago we set up <strong><a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki">Open-Source Snowplow</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>at <strong><a href="https://www.cargurus.com/">CarGurus</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>to fulfill a need for self-managed client-side instrumentation. Since that time it has become incredibly impactful for the entire company and has scaled significantly beyond what was originally envisioned. The following is an overview ofÂ&nbsp;<strong>why we set  up the system</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>our experience with it,</strong>Â&nbsp;<strong>what we have learned</strong>, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>where we see it continuing to go.</strong></p><p>This post is quite long, so before getting too far into the details....</p><h3>Total events collected: <mark>&gt;268 billion</mark></h3><h3>Data collected: <mark>&gt; 1.5pb (uncompressed)</mark></h3><h3>Event volume: <mark>~ 1 billion events/day</mark></h3><h3>Max Daily Throughput: <mark>~ 15k events/second (sustained during peak hours)</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct events: </strong><mark><strong>hundreds and hundreds</strong></mark></h3><h3>Infrastructure upgrade duration: <mark>less than two minutes with zero downtime</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct sites with Snowplow tracking: </strong><mark><strong>&gt; 180</strong></mark></h3><p><em>So let's dive in.</em></p><p>We chose Snowplow instead of building our own event tracking system, and plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. Why? </p><h3><strong>We wanted to independently manage and scale data collection systems.</strong></h3><p>A conversation early in my tenure at CarGurus made a topic abundantly clear: many teams had a strong desire to separate concerns. At that time the company was growing quickly and demands were rapidly changing. Analysts and engineers were joining, onboarding fast, and asking completely new questions of our data. It was all-too-common to tell them their questions simply could not be answered due to the additional load tracking would place on production systems.</p><p>After being personally involved with a couple event-volume-related site outages, it was evident we needed to rethink data collection systems. We needed to be able to scale data collection infrastructure completely separately from application infrastructure, and we needed to significantly isolate the blast radius if something went wrong.</p><p>Snowplow was a strongÂ&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span>.</p><h3>We wanted to modernize event collection systems.</h3><p>Another requirement of choosing Snowplow was its ability to quickly and effectively introduce aÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://lambda-architecture.net/">lambda architecture</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>into our analytics stack. As customer needs and demands evolved, we found that having both a real-time, low-latency (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds) component of the event pipeline as well as a batch-based, higher-latency (on the order of minutes) component gave usÂ&nbsp;significantÂ&nbsp;flexibility toÂ&nbsp;proactively fulfill stakeholder asks before they surfaced<em>.</em></p><p>Our pipelines are set up in AWS with <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Kinesis</a></strong> as transport and <strong><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a></strong> as long-term data storage. As stakeholders need real-time access to enriched data, Kinesis is the go-to location. If stakeholders need access to historical event data or want to augment it with other sources in the data warehouse, Snowflake is the place to go.</p><p>Snowplow allowed us to introduce new ideas and methodologies and fulfill both point-in-time and future stakeholder needs.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>The world of third-party tracking is rapidly changing and will continue to.</h3><p>As anyone involved in the world of client-side analytics is probably well-aware of, third-party tracking is increasingly going away. Initiatives like <strong><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">this</a></strong>Â&nbsp;and <strong><a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>andÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/duckduckgo-adds-tracker-blocking-to-help-curb-the-wider-surveillance-web/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>are fantastic for online privacy (and commendable), but have major implications for tracking and analytics. With an eye towards the future we knew we needed to decrease reliance on Google Analytics, Adobe, Heap, and all other similar third-party tracking systems if we wanted full insight into web traffic. We wanted 100% of site behavior instead of sampled GA or ad-blocked Adobe. And we wanted to own the resulting data.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to track first-party web activity and regain full visibility into usage behavior on our site.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>Snowplow sets a high bar for fault-tolerance, redundancy, and durability.</h3><p>When set up properly, the Snowplow infrastructure isÂ&nbsp;extremelyÂ&nbsp;fault-tolerant. We set up ours in AWS and have not regretted it whatsoever.</p><p>Javascript tracking code buffers unsent events locally in the case of collection infrastructure being down. AWS application load balancers are multi-AZ and AWS maintains a good SLA for them. All access logs are retained for a period of time in case the load balancer is up but the rest of the system is down. Kinesis replicates data across three AZ's by default, and retention can be configured up to 168 hours in the case of mid-pipeline enrichment outages. S3 is highly durable and highly available by default. And the list goes on....</p><h3>We wanted to own all data that was generated.</h3><p>As mentioned above, if we were going to invest time and money building scalable event-collection infrastructure, <em>we simply</em>Â&nbsp;<em>had to own the outcome.</em>Â&nbsp;It is a significant investment to get large-scale infrastructure and instrumentation off the ground, and it's hard to do tracking in a way that doesn't impose a burden on analysts down the road (think <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events">Google Analytics events</a>).</p><p>We didn't want to deal with API rate limiting when attempting to recover our data. We didn't want to be tied to BigQuery, and we didn't want our customers' data flowing through other companies' systems.</p><h3>We needed to keep data quality high.</h3><p>When building out data collection and processing systems, it's one thing to set up infrastructure. It's a completely different story to keep quality high as priorities, teams, and customer demands shift. It's even harder to impose more work in an attempt to keep data "clean".</p><p>The way snowplow handles event validation and stream-redirection was a perfect fit in our case. After setting the system up we quickly found that leveraging <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/2-Specific-event-tracking-with-the-Javascript-tracker#trackSelfDescribingEvent">Self-Describing Events</a>Â&nbsp;and the associated <a href="https://json-schema.org/">jsonschemas</a> empowered us to enforce data quality in a very low-friction way. Whenever events start flowing (with a bad push, etc) that don't adhere to the implementing party's jsonschema, they are redirected out of the "good" path for immediate review and recovery. Self-describing events (and jsonschemas) also gave us the ability to do some pretty neat automation, which will be covered later.</p><h3>The world of compliance is changing rapidly and we needed the ability to audit every piece of information.</h3><p>Since we first set up Snowplow the world has been forced to navigate two big data-privacy hurdles: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>. Since we own and operate all collection infrastructure we did not need to get a third-party vendor DPA. Snowplow gives a significant amount of flexibility for enriching and redirecting PII, as well as configurable pseudonymization. It's good, it "just works", and it has saved us a considerable amount of time.</p><p>We've also spent a significant amount of time persisting full system lineage when splitting events into Snowflake which makes it easy to fully adhere to privacy legislation and associated requirements.</p><h3>We wanted to build, guide, and get out of the way.</h3><p>My favorite part about programming and tech isÂ&nbsp;building (machine) processes, cultivating good (human) habits, and getting out of the way. An early challenge was maintainingÂ&nbsp;clear, consistent definitions of data between frontend engineers (the implementer of tracking) and analysts (the stakeholders of said tracking). Event data was previously tracked, flowed through a number of different systems, and was often renamed (sometimes several times) when it finally landed in Snowflake.. Snowplow's self-describing events have allowed us to shift many conversations away from data pipeline engineers and back to where they should be taking place. I was able to back away since stakeholders and implementers were able to approach important conversations from a point of shared, consistent understanding.</p><h3>Last but not least, we needed to hit the ground running.</h3><p>While we may have had time to build out our own system from scratch, why build when you can lean on the backs of giants? The community of people contributing to Snowplow has grown significantly since the first time I implemented it, and people all over the world have run into almost every challenge imaginable. As fun as it would have been to deconstruct the system and build and implement our own,Â&nbsp;<em>it simply wasn't worth it.Â&nbsp;</em>Our stakeholders had questions that they wanted answered "yesterday" and their needs were our priority #1.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to hit the ground running and answer real business questions "now".Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h2>Phase 1: Keep It Simple. Get It Running. Prove the System's Worth.</h2><p>When Snowplow was first rolled out there was a single mission in mind:Â&nbsp;<em>make sure it was a good organizational fit.Â&nbsp;</em>We had systems in place with some functional overlap already, so we had to make sure we weren't introducing a new system simply........ for the sake of introducing a new system. Or staking claim in others' territory. The system had to work. It had to answer questions that had been previously-unanswerable. It had to be robust. And it had to solve real-life challenges.</p><h3>We very consciously chose to<strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Automate all infrastructure.</strong> We wanted to scale, upgrade, and roll out entirely new sets of infrastructure fast. Everything was <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraformed</a>Â&nbsp;and infrastructure was 100% immutable.</p><p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> We could have gone straight to k8s or autoscaling clusters or ecs or eks or any other new (admittedly attractive) thing. But we didn't. We wanted to see how the system itself would perform and scale.</p><p><strong>Focus on the stakeholder.Â&nbsp;</strong>The only way this initiative was going to work was if others felt ownership of it, it decreased their pain, it empowered them to do their jobs better, or a combination of all. Instead of focusing on a hip/cool/hot/new systemÂ&nbsp;<em>we focused on answering the questions at hand.</em></p><h3>We initially choseÂ&nbsp;<strong>not to</strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Pile on infrastructure complexity or over-optimize.</strong>Â&nbsp;We wanted to see how the system performed at scale when viewed under a magnifying lens. Since the best way to put a system through its paces is by minimizing complexity and other overhead, that's what we did. We wanted to know what goes wrong and potential system bottlenecks.</p><p><strong>Implement a widespread mandate.Â&nbsp;</strong>I strongly believe the most effective way to approach important conversations is with real-life (not theoretical) …</p></article></div>

While criticizing the government, or even waving the wrong flag, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53244862">could get you imprisoned</a> in any territory under Chinese rule, your right to freedom of expression is sacrosanct under the First Amendment—until you step into your place of work, that is. While the government is not entitled to punish political dissent, in most parts of America it is perfectly legal for your boss to fire you if they happen to dislike the person you voted for in the last election. </p><div><p>This restriction on political expression is especially harmful at a time when, nearly every day, somebody is accused of having transgressed against some commonly (or even not so commonly) held taboo. In many of these cases, employees—from senior staff at prominent institutions to working-class laborers—have been fired. Even outside of working hours, it would now be perfectly reasonable for most Americans to think twice before speaking their minds about hot-button issues.</p><p> In their attempts to remedy the most pernicious aspects of cancel culture, critics have mostly concentrated on advocating less punitive social norms. This is good as far as it goes. Our political culture will only become more liberal if we all stop demanding that people be punished or fired for imaginary transgressions. Yet, this emphasis on culture ignores the important role that legislative reform could play in defending the most vulnerable: If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons, Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views might cost them their livelihoods.</p></div><p><strong>The Problem with At-Will Employment</strong></p><p>At the moment, most American workers are subject to “at-will” contracts. As long as their employers do not fire them on the basis of a narrow set of protected characteristics, such as gender, race, and sexual orientation, they can lose their jobs at any time, for any reason. Nor is there a due process requirement: Companies are under no legal obligation to investigate whether the ostensible reasons for axing an employee are grounded in reality. (The only state that categorically prohibits at-will employment, after six months on the job, <a href="https://spoonlaw.com/437-2/">is Montana</a>). </p><div><p> The prevalence of at-will employment makes it easier for employers to engage in knee-jerk reactions to short-lived social media controversies. For instance, a Hispanic electrician working for the San Diego Gas and Electric company was fired for cracking his knuckles in a photograph because a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">social media mob believed that he was</a> flashing a white power sign. The man who took the picture has since admitted that he probably misinterpreted the interaction, and thousands of people have now <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sdge-reinstate-emmanuel-caffertys-job-sdge">signed a petition</a>, asking the electrician’s former employer to reverse the mistake. But since the employee has already lost his job, it will be hard for him to obtain justice. As in many other cases, both parties would have been better off if the law had required the company to afford due process to an accused worker <em>before</em> deciding whether or not to fire him. </p><p> There is a better alternative: Contracts negotiated by labor unions often provide so-called “just cause” protections for employees. The tests of just cause <a href="https://www.massnurses.org/labor-action/labor-education-resources/grievances-101/just-cause#:~:text=Just%20cause%20is%20the%20standard,must%20be%20just%20and%20fair.&amp;text=The%20concept%20of%20just%20cause%20is%20well%20established%20in%20labor%20law.">typically include questions</a> such as whether the employee was forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions, whether the rules were applied evenly, and whether there was an objective investigation into the employee’s conduct. In other words, it forces employers to conduct a fair process before firing their employees, which gives the accused a real chance to defend themselves. If we really care about free speech and due process, these protections should be available to every American.</p></div><div><p>Opponents of these reforms have long argued that they would come at a heavy cost to the economy. But scholars who have studied the impact of wrongful discharge protections have obtained mixed results. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12860.pdf">One 2007 study of U.S. employers</a>, for example, found that the introduction of such protections resulted in some loss of productivity, but also led to strong growth in overall employment numbers.</p></div><p><strong>Stop Employers From Discriminating Against Views They Don’t Like</strong></p><p> Just cause legislation would help to reduce the number of capricious firings. But, as long as bosses can legally terminate employees because they dislike their political views, such legislation would only go partway towards remedying the chilling effects on free speech. That’s why those of us who worry about cancel culture should also push for the inclusion of political affiliation in the rubric of anti-discrimination laws. </p><p> The Civil Rights Act has long prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, or national origin. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">ruled that this provision</a> also protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. But there are no equivalent federal protections to prevent employees from being disadvantaged because of their political views.</p><div><p>This is a missed opportunity, as the success of local ordinances mandating such protections has shown. In Washington D.C., for example, the <a href="https://ohr.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ohr/publication/attachments/LawsAndRegs-HumanRightsAct-1977-English.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> prohibits employment discrimination based on political affiliation, defined as “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” As Edgar Njatou, Executive Director of Workplace Fairness, told me in an interview, this ensures that your boss can’t fire you if they “find out you voted for Hillary or that you’re a Republican.”</p><p> Seattle has even more ambitious protections for workers’ political views. Its laws prohibit discrimination based on “<a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.06UNPUACPR&amp;showChanges=true">political ideology</a>,” which is defined as “any idea or belief … relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.” But even this law mostly serves to protect people with relatively common political views. After the 2016 election, for example, local rental listings began to discourage Trump supporters from applying. “If you are a landlord,” city government spokesperson Elliot Bronstein, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/no-trump-clause-is-new-requirement-for-some-seattle-renters/416269805">wrote in response</a>, “you cannot discriminate on political status.” (Like other protections against discrimination, this does not apply to housemates, who share an apartment or living space.) </p></div><p>There are two obvious objections—both of which could easily be addressed. First, some organizations have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their employees share a broad worldview: It would make no sense, for example, to stop a political campaign group from discriminating against a job applicant who opposes the organization’s goals. Explicitly political organizations should therefore enjoy a carve-out from the stricture against discriminating on the basis of political beliefs (though they would still have to afford existing employees the due process protections guaranteed under “just cause” provisions). </p><p>Second, employers have a legitimate interest in protecting their staff from the hateful conduct of colleagues: Clearly, for example, no member of an ethnic minority should have to endure racist taunts at their place of work. But this could also be addressed through carefully worded legislation. Seattle already offers exemptions for political conduct that would cause “substantial and material disruption of the property rights of the provider of a place of public accommodation.” Employers also have an affirmative obligation to protect employees from racist harassment.</p><p>Balancing competing goods is one of the core purposes of any legal system. There is no reason to think that our laws could not protect the speech of political minorities, without hampering the operation of overtly political organizations or burdening ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities with the fear of harassment.</p><p><strong>We Can Make It Happen</strong></p><p>New employment regulations always face an especially tough uphill battle in Congress. But, though it will not be easy to win legislative approval for such reforms, every major faction of American political life has its own reasons for supporting them. </p><p>The left should be sympathetic to the wish to expand job protections for American workers, which lag significantly behind those of other developed countries. While conservatives are usually hostile to such regulations, they should recognize that these reforms would help to protect them against the growing influence of cancel culture. And philosophical liberals—those of us who believe in a pluralistic society that encourages ideological diversity—have the most principled reason to get on board.</p><p>Hatred of any form of wrong think now <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9790764/partisan-discrimination">threatens the foundations</a> of our social fabric. Since the stakes of public policy debates are high, it is understandable—and even admirable—for citizens to subject each other’s views to vigorous criticism. But, if ordinary people fear that a minor misunderstanding or a deeply held difference of opinion might cost them their jobs, freedom of speech—the cornerstone of any liberal order—is under serious threat. </p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>After a protracted move to Portland (Oregon), I’m back to writing about parrots.</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Steve used to say to me, and he used to say this a lot. Hey Jony, here’s a dopey idea. And sometimes they were. Really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room. And they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones. Which in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound. </p><cite>Jony Ive, Steve Jobs memorial service, Apple Campus, 2011</cite></blockquote>



<p>One of the secrets of Apple’s success comes in this wonderful quote from Jony Ive. The part he didn’t mention—partly because it wasn’t relevant to the story—is that sometimes the magnificent ideas came out of the dopey ideas. </p>



<p>All of us are capable of bold, crazy, or magnificent ideas, but if we’re not allowed the freedom to have dopey ideas and voice them, some of these potential ideas may never come to fruition.</p>



<p>The more years I worked at Apple, the more timid I felt people had become to bring up ideas that they had. I finally figured out that it was likely due to the average tenure of an employee dropping dramatically as hiring went increased exponentially.</p>



<p>Someone that has been at Apple for 10 years is certainly very secure in voicing ideas, whereas someone that has only been there less than 2 years is understandably more reticent.</p>



<p>So, I don’t think Apple’s culture of being open to dopey ideas has changed, but the average employee is less likely to bring them up. I think this is probably true of any company that has experienced insane growth.</p>



<p>But back to dopey ideas.</p>



<p>Imagine being in a meeting with several people that each have dopey ideas. If no one says anything, nothing happens. But if one brings theirs up, it could either be combined with another dopey idea or tacked on to an existing good idea.</p>



<p>Perhaps the dopey idea sits on the back burner and simmers for years and then suddenly it becomes a brilliant idea because of the market or products changing.</p>



<p>If you work for Apple or any other company, be sure to encourage people to have dopey ideas and voice them. </p>



<p>Steve would want you to.</p>

<p>This program creates an integer counter protected by a mutex, spawns 10 threads, increments the counter 10 times from each thread, and prints the total.</p>
<p>The <code>counter</code> variable lives on the stack, and  a pointer to these stack data is shared with other threads.
The threads have to lock the mutex to do the increments.
When printing the total, the counter is read bypassing the mutex, without any synchronization.</p>
<p>The beauty of this program is that it relies on several bits of subtle reasoning for correctness, each of which is checked by compiler:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Child threads don’t escape the <code>main</code> function and so can read <code>counter</code> from its stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads only access <code>counter</code> through the mutex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads will have terminated by the time we read <code>total</code> out of <code>counter</code> without mutex.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If any of these constraints is broken, the compiler rejects the code.
There’s no need for <code>std::shared_ptr</code> just to defensively make sure that the memory isn’t freed under your feet.</p>
<p>Rust allows doing dangerous, clever, and fast things without fear of introducing undefined behavior.</p>
<p>If you like what you see, here are two books I recommend for diving deeper into Rust:</p>

<h2>Announcing the General Availability of OKD4</h2>
<p>Today, the OKD-WG is pleased to announce the General Availability of OKD4, the community distribution of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes platform. With today’s GA release of OKD4, Red Hat continues its commitment to open source and open collaboration with the Kubernetes and other Cloud Native communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png" alt="" width="600" srcset="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=300&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 300w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 600w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=900&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 900w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1200&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1200w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1500w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1800&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<h2>OKD’s Origins</h2>
<p>In April 2012, Red Hat first released Origin as the open source upstream project of OpenShift. We had little inkling of the phenomenal trajectory of cloud-native technology that was to come. From the rise of containers, the birth of OCI and Fedora CoreOS, and now the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/operator-framework-moves-to-cncf-for-incubation" rel=" noopener">CNCF’s incubation of Operator Framework</a>, it has been an amazing ride. OKD4 wouldn’t be possible without all these incredible innovative technologies and their communities.</p>
<p>During the 3.x release timeframe, OKD has been a stable basis for OpenShift Container Platform, acting as an upstream distribution based on community-driven components - CentOS and Project Atomic to name a few. With the advent of the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image">Universal Base Image,</a> relations between OKD and OCP has changed - from "upstream-downstream" to what we call "sibling distributions." Images are built using RHEL7 base and can be distributed simultaneously for OKD and OCP, with no rebuild necessary. This enables both distributions to get updated code earlier, including security fixes from RHEL7, and provides a stable base for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>OpenShift 4.x heavily focuses on high availability, observability and seamless upgrades. With the OKD 4 release, the community is not only getting easy access to these features, but also the ability to affect the direction of the platform (via <a href="https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/">enhancements process</a>) and a community space for experimentation, discussion and knowledge sharing. The Operators pattern used throughout the design of OKD 4 is allowing users to maintain clusters efficiently over their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Release Highlights</h2>
<p>OKD4 uses <a href="https://youtu.be/JepNm7R0LSo">Fedora CoreOS</a> as a base OS for the nodes. It enables the cluster with recent security fixes, new features (like cgroups v2 support) and updated software. OKD4 is using the same images as the corresponding OpenShift Container Platform release. As a result, the community can participate in the development and can modify any part of the cluster in order to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>The cluster still has the same features as in OKD3 - it can be installed in the user environment, configured to user liking and updated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How it differs from OCP</h2>
<p>Unlike OCP there are several distinctive features in OKD4:</p>
<p>As a community distribution it does not require a pull secret from <a href="https://openshift.com/try">https://openshift.com/try</a>. All OKD4 images are available without additional authentication. The base OS image for OKD4 is available at <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/">https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/</a>. However some optional operators from <a href="https://operatorhub.io/" rel=" noopener">operatorhub.io</a> require a pull secret, so by default OKD4 installs a source with community operators only. See <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-enable-the-non-community-red-hat-operators">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<p>OCP is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a heavy focus on high availability and production workloads. This puts restrictions on cluster configuration - for instance, single master installations are not supported. OKD4, however, allows users to install single master clusters - for development or stage environments. These clusters cannot be upgraded to later versions, though.</p>
<p>OKD4 creates a new nightly release after OCP tests are completed by our CI system. Every two weeks we'll promote a nightly to a stable release stream, so users can get updates to latest and tested code without switching channels.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Installing OKD4 is as easy as OCP4 - see <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd#getting-started">Getting Started</a> for instructions.</p>
<p>OKD-specific documentation is available at <a href="https://docs.okd.io/">docs.okd.io</a></p>

What are you reading today? What have you learnt today that you did not know previously.</p>

<p>In today’s article, its a curation of the articles i’ve read on the second half of June! The articles are classified to the few topics:</p>
<br>
<h2>Topics covered</h2>
<ul>
<li>General Technology and resources for video call</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>General</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Management for tech</li>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/02/03/lego-blocks-and-organ-transplants/">Organ transplant than lego blocks </a></p>

<p>Software reuseability does not always allow you to copy code wholesale to be placed into another. It requires you to make tweaks and alterations to get it to work as intended in another application. It’s more of an organ transplant than a lego brick. An accurate illustration to share a point! (:</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fly.io/blog/how-cdns-generate-certificates/">How CDNs generate certificate</a></p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fly.io/">fly.io</a>’s article is really interesting. It goes into the mechanics of how certifications are issued, and how does Let’s Encrypt verify your domain belongs to you. That is through the ACME protocol of course. Interstingly, they do provide free tier k8s services at $10/mth equivalent of paid services. Thats super decent. They seek to be competitive with the bigger players such as Google Cloud , Amazon Web Service and Azure.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/team-video/aviary.sh">Aviary.sh</a></p>

<p>If you heard about ansible, it seeks to serve the same role - configuration management. Maybe a good alternative to ansible if it has different dependences that VMs may not have for ansible.</p>

<p>Saw this and its interesting to see hacker news stream in a different format. It would be nice to have a refresh button instead of a manual refresh to get updates.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://regexone.com/">learning regex</a></p>

<p>This website allows you to learn regex with good explanations with exercises that allows you to get your hands dirty. Being an advocate of learn by doing.  I really like how learning has been made easier for people to pick up a skill in bite sizes. No we should not spoon feed people but neither do we give a medium rare steak to a baby. Everything requires a progress and a series of steps to learn the essential skills before proceeding to a higher level competency. Personally, this is a good example of what seems like a lightweight and highly reusable static site for learning a new skill. Definitely a reference for my next pet projects.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/schenkd/nginx-ui">Nginx UI</a></p>

<p>As i was talking about Nginx as a file server, Nginx configuration has always been done via the command line and CLI. This is really amazing to have a UI for you to do your configuration with nice buttons to enable or disable your nginx settings. Really neat and interesting for you to consider on your own project.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mediasoup.org/documentation/overview/">Mediasoup a Selective Forwarding Unit tool for RTC applications</a></p>

<p>If you want to create a webRTC application, there are many architecture to consider. You can read up more about them in my previous post <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">here</a>. In order to scale one, you have to consider the Selective Forwarding Unit as the server to transmit your media from your device to your remote peers. One of the beliefs I have is “never reinvent the wheel”. We are in a technology era where many giants have gone before you and already created many tools available for use. So in the case of scalability, it is true that there is no one tool that helps you to address all the technical challenges, but knowing the components of a successful and scalable video call application allows you to then identify the right tools for its respective components.</p>

<p>You have to first identify the screw, in order to realize the need for a screw driver and not a hammer.</p>

<p>Here’s a video talking about mediasoup as well:</p>

</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how people across the world are also attempting to solve the same problem, and this time he was able to break down the entire technology stack he used for his video call application. I wonder if it is able to deal with its scalability issue? As well. Below are a TON of articles about video call application that people has so kindly shared with me and now it is my responsibility to delve deeper into this topic and make sense of it.</p>

<p>Chanced upon this simple gadget - a full size 50 keys keyboard with a grey screen that is only about to contain 6 lines of words at any one point. This gadget was created as a way to focus on one thing - typing. For those that are in need for productivity, perhaps such a gadget can help you on that. Beyond productivity, i always wonder if students that are just starting out on their english education could start with such a gadget as well. Simple and straight to the point. It is a keyboard and all you can do is to type and make sense of what is written. But of course, english language goes beyond just stringing words together, that is only the outcome of many other fundamental skills such as grammar and understanding verbs, nouns, pronouns etc.</p>

<p>Mapillary is a geospatial company that strives to create a global street-level imagary dataset to rival Google Street View. Of all company to acquire such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, apparently facebook is the one to acquire them. Facebook actually has been actively involved in the mapping space, contributing over 800,000 kilometers of mappred roads to <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>. It is an opensource crowd funded application that builds a community of mappers that contributes and maintain data about roads, trails, cafes, railway stations and more.</p>

<p>Data is asset. As with all things, once we start to put our own agenda over the rights (privacy rights in this case) of people, thats where the problem starts. Although there are clause to indicate that they may still collect data from you in incognito mode, i guess this violation of rights still stands. In the realm of technology, its all chill and breezy until you start collecting data from users. That’s when you are in for a whole new ball game. Does your entire architecture considered the suite of security measures before your collect your customers first data? Like a ship, you cannot just leave the back portion of the ship unbuilt or complete before you put the ship into waters.</p>

<p>Always love to hear people or organizations pooling in resources to equip and train individuals through challenges. Starting up a company is definitely a trying time and we have to gather as much meaningful knowledge and skills else we will risk bringing the company down. Community support is also crucial for us to exchange experiences and more importantly lessons from one another’s mistakes. This will definitely be something one should put some serious thought if you wish to start your own</p>

<p>Telegram has always been my go to for numerous reasons: speed, ease of use, multi device login, PIN MESSAGE feature, games, platform for bot creation and games. These are just the perks experienced by an end user myself. The security and secret channel provides a nice option for more confidential conversations as well. All powerful tools can be disastrous if it lands onto the hands of scheming ones. So i always wonder how telegram seeks to address issues of users utilizing such a powerful platform for destructive goals. Till today, this question seems to be unanswered.</p>

<p>When we want to grow, more often than not, we choose skirt the challenge before us and find easier alternatives because we feel inadequate. Here’s an example, if you want to learn a language, lets say korean, and somehow you managed to have a job offer that allows you to speak korean, but you choose to turn down that job because you dont feel confident enough in your language yet. So instead, you choose to listen to podcast at home everyday until you feel you are ready. You know what could have helped you to get better in korean? Working at a job in korean.</p>

<p>This is a common tendency as we make crippling decisions if these decisions are directed by fear. Fear has its own way to manipulate us to find alternatives with its fair share of difficulty to substitute the real thing itself. If you want to growth and succeed? There is no other way, but one way: fail forward.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, I’ve spent the last several years disillusioned with technology. All the quirky little tools people made gave way to ad-fueled companies that refused to play well with others.</p>



<p>This is the first time I’ve been excited for a new technology in memory.</p>



<p>ActivityPub is to HTTP what HTTP was to TCP/IP. TCP/IP bridged disparate systems and allowed them to communicate reliably. HTTP allowed the various services built on TCP/IP to communicate with each other reliably.</p>



<p>ActivityPub goes one step further and provides a way for users on those services to communicate in a way that has the appearance of directness. I can follow, for example, Blender’s videos on PeerTube from my Mastodon account. Or I can use a blog platform that speaks ActivityPub and let people follow it from other services. It’s all the best features of Twitter with the flexibility of RSS. And unlike Twitter, your Mastodon profile will probably never lose its RSS feed in a company’s pursuit of profit. The main project already funds itself through Patreon, as do most of the larger instances.</p>



<p>It’s still early. We could be looking at a situation like Usenet and Gopher where neither ended up being The Thing because AOL soaked up the nascent public internet, then Facebook soaked up the nascent commercial web.</p>



<p>Right now the popularity of Mastodon carries ActivityPub while projects like Plume (blogging), Pixelfed (image sharing), and others work toward their potential.</p>



<p>I have noticed a tendency for people supporting older, similar protocols to wonder why ActivityPub got so popular while their own stagnated. We could speculate. If people knew Ostatus at all, they understood it as a protocol for making Twitter clones. XMPP spoke XML in an age of JSON, and it was perceived as an instant messenger protocol.</p>



<p>Both focused on liberating people from commercial silos. Mastodon had some press to that effect regarding Twitter, but people on there have come to care less as its native and diverse community grows to a self-sufficient level.</p>



<p>Twitter and Facebook are struggling to cope with their place in a massive cultural shift and shaky transfer of generational power. As I write this, Facebook has just lost 25% of its share price on the announcement that it expects weak growth.</p>



<p>I think the growing ActivityPub federation has a good chance. No one interacts with my tweets anymore. Meanwhile, I get response <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@Kye">on Mastodon</a> that reminds me of the early days of Twitter, before they betrayed their developer community and hired a legion of people to cut ad deals.</p>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>I've been a fanboy of DHH and Jason of <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> since around 2006 when I first read <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal">Getting Real</a> and started writing code in <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. We used Basecamp (and for a brief time, Highrise) as our primary communication tool for the first few years of <a href="https://freeagent.com/">FreeAgent</a> and it was a big influence from a product point of view. For the past 8 years though, I've not really used Basecamp products but I have remained a follower of the company and founders, reading their books and enjoying their Twitter rants. I'm still an ardent Rails fan as well – I rarely code at work these days so I built an app for this blog during lockdown to scratch that particular itch 👨‍💻&nbsp;</p><p>When I heard about HEY, I was immediately interested. Not because I've lost control of my inbox (I'm an order-freak and avid filterer so my inbox is generally a tranquil place), but because the HEY statement about why "Email’s a treasure" rang so true to me and because a brand-new, Rails-based, Basecamp product is always going to be pretty exciting to try.</p><p>I got my invite early and I've been kicking the tyres for a while, so I've written up a few thoughts to get them out there and to hear about what other people think.&nbsp;</p></div><div>
<p>I've been using email for 28 years. I got my first email account back in 1992 when I started university and I rarely received any email from what I can remember. I probably got the odd message from tutors, but during uni my online communication was largely centred on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>. Remember that?</p><p>On leaving university I didn't use email for a while. I got my first job via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> forum so I must have used email for that, but it wasn't until the arrival of Hotmail a year or two later that I had my first 'permanent' email address and could access it anywhere (still a limited choice in 1996!). I got my first work email with my second job and then I moved on from Hotmail to Yahoo and stuck that out until 2003 when Gmail launched (and after Yahoo inexplicably deleted all my email by accident).&nbsp;</p><p>I stayed happily with Google until 2015 when I moved over to Fastmail so I could use my own domain and pay for a proper email product and not be the product myself. I still use Gmail (via G Suite) for work though.</p></div><div><p>With the arrival of HEY, I loved the privacy-first focus (no more 'spy trackers') and the new workflows (Set Aside, Focus and Reply etc) sounded great. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">Jason's demo</a> was compelling. I'm fascinated by what they've achieved with modern Rails and Javascript, the simplicity of the front-end code and speed of it all really is a triumph.&nbsp;</p><p>However once I got invited, the reality of using it has been something of a mixed bag of utter delight with some frustrations. Let's dig into it.</p></div><div>
<p><strong>Focus and Reply<br></strong>This is a headline feature and it's really very good. Flag your emails 'Reply Later' as you're reading your new mails and stack them up for dealing with later. When you're ready, Focus and Reply lets you hammer through them all at once from a single screen. It's a brilliant workflow.</p><action-text-attachment content-type="image" url="https://hey.com/assets/how-it-works/reply-mode-60e4b5c00da627a4738e055d295e13d848d4ecdd806aad1e7bbec4a8ac0d8c32.png" width="1800" height="1871"><figure>

</figure></action-text-attachment></div><p><strong>Spy Tracking</strong></p><div><p>I think the Spy Tracker support is brilliant and should become the standard in all email apps. Perhaps it will. I actually emailed Fastmail about this and their reply was pretty interesting:</p></div><blockquote>
<em>We've blocked remote images from loading by default for years: </em><a href="https://codepatterns.org/help/receive/remotecontent.html?u=90cc41d3"><em>https://www.fastmail.com/help/receive/remotecontent.html</em></a><em>.&nbsp;<p>And if you do enable remote loading of images for your known contacts, or you just enable it for a single message, then our servers proxy the images, so all the sender can know is details about our hosts and nothing about you.&nbsp;</p></em>
</blockquote><div><p>So, actually, Fastmail are pretty much doing the same thing other than alerting you to the fact that emails are using SendGrid or whatever?</p></div><p><strong>Clips</strong></p><div>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>Clips is a brilliant feature that I never knew I needed. Highlight some text and save it in your list of clips. I can see this feature being expanded in the future, such as filtering and being able to set expiry dates.</p></div><p><strong>Custom Domains</strong></p><div><p>Perhaps the most common complaint I've seen on Twitter is the lack of custom domain support. I run email off my own domain so this is of course something of a blocker to my own full-time adoption. I did try forwarding my email into HEY for a while so I could use the app in anger, but I'm not yet ready to make my @hey.com address my default so I've paused this for now. <a href="https://hey.com/custom-domains/">Custom domains are coming</a> in 2020 and I'm excited to see what they offer from day one. I hope they nail it.</p></div><p><strong>🔕 Notifications&nbsp;</strong></p><div><p>Despite being something of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk">inbox zero</a> fiend, I have no problem with the <strong>Previously Seen</strong> list in my Imbox. I really like the idea of <strong>Paper Trail</strong> and <strong>The Feed</strong>, and autofiling email in there is great but I have a real gripe with notifications. I definitely <em>don't</em> want to be notified via push on my phone when a new item hits either of these areas, but when I log into HEY I definitely <em>do</em> want to be notified, visually, that there's something new to view in these areas. As it stands, I have to compulsively check each one irrespective of whether there's something new. HEY's philosophy is that I should ignore them entirely until I feel like reading my Feed, but in reality this is never going to work for me. I'd like to have HEY alert me to the fact that there's something there, and if I feel like reading the feed at that time I will, otherwise I'll come back later. If I don't know, I feel compelled to check which is just a waste of time.</p><p>Now forgive me for my sins, but I actually want to receive notifications for emails that hit my Imbox by default, not the other way round. With HEY there is no way to do this – no notifications at all. You have to manually edit each contact and enable notifications for them specifically. I'd much rather HEY let me choose which is <em>my</em> preferred default, irrespective of the philosophy. Let me default to on.</p><p><strong>Imbox</strong></p></div><p>Please just call it Inbox! I can never unsee a typo here, I'm sorry. I understand but it just doesn't work for me.</p><div>
<p><strong>Quoted text rendering</strong><br>This is a total design challenge and HEY is no worse than Gmail in this regard, but I have to say Fastmail do a far better job of it. HEY rendering feels like a backwards step after using Fastmail and its multi-coloured threading.

</figure></action-text-attachment><p><strong>Exporting</strong><br>The export to MBOX feature is great – it's my data and it means I'm not locked in. I know that if I decide to leave HEY, I can easily export all my mail and push it back into Fastmail. However, I like to label a bunch of my emails and currently this metadata will be lost when exporting from HEY. I suggested to DHH that they use IMAP folders in the export to maintain label information and <a href="https://twitter.com/lylo/status/1275426572053471233?s=20">he said it was a good idea</a>, so perhaps it will see the light of day soon 🤞</p></div><p><strong>😴 Snooze</strong></p><p>Set Aside is great, I like it a lot. But sometimes there are emails that I want to set aside for a longer period and the Snooze feature in Gmail and Fastmail is super-handy for this. When you set something aside in HEY, the email is there in the stack, staring at you in the face every time you visit. This isn't desirable for 'set aside for ages' emails, so a Snooze function (either as part of Set Aside, or just in general) would be great.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Undoubtedly the killer feature of HEY is the built-in workflow. Some people have suggested that this is a feature that could be replicated in standard email, so I had a crack at this with my Fastmail account. While not being a match for HEY, it actually worked surprisingly well!</p><p>I first created labels for <strong>Reply Later</strong>, <strong>Set Aside</strong>, <strong>The Feed</strong> and <strong>Paper Trail:</strong></p></div><div>

Admittedly not as slick as HEY but it's blazingly fast (as are most things in Fastmail) when you're used to it. </p><p>I then set up rules to move things into The Feed and Paper Trail.

It turns out it's extremely rare that I receive an email from someone that I want to screen out. I can do this in Fastmail using blocking, but my blocklist is virtually empty. </p><p>If I was using HEY for my work email, however, it would be a <strong>completely different story </strong>which does make me wonder whether HEY's future success really lies in the business market.</p></div><div><p>Using HEY is a really nice and unique email experience, but it's early days and 'power users' like me will likely find it lacking in some areas. </p><p>I've already paid for my first year because I love the @hey.com email address, I really want to try HEY with custom domains when they launch, and I also want to see how it develops in the coming year. I'm also happy to pay Basecamp to keep developing this product as it feels important right now. <strong>The world needs more players in the email provider space, especially high-quality, privacy-focused products</strong>. Until HEY arrived, Fastmail was the only <em>major</em> player other than the obvious 'free' options of Gmail, Microsoft and Yahoo.</p><p>Can HEY fully replace Fastmail for me though? Will I be renewing in 12 month's time?</p><p>Once custom domains land, I think it <em>could</em> replace Fastmail for me. That said, I'll likely still end up paying for Fastmail irrespective of how HEY develops simply because of their excellent multi-domain support. So I'll probably end up paying for both! 😅</p><p>With Fastmail I can create forwarders on my family domain for the kids (I really hope HEY's custom domain feature will support this, but I'm not confident they will). I can also support fully-featured email on all the domains I own (such as the one for this blog!) without incurring any additional cost or hassle dealing with other email providers.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  
<span>Syntax errors are generally easy to fix for humans, but not for parsers in general nor LR parsers in</span>
<span>particular. Traditional ‘panic mode’ error recovery, though easy to implement and applicable to</span>
<span>any grammar, often leads to a cascading chain of errors that drown out the original. More</span>
<span>advanced error recovery techniques suffer less from this problem but have seen little practical use</span>
<span>because their typical performance was seen as poor, their worst case unbounded, and the</span>
<span>repairs they reported arbitrary. In this paper we introduce the </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>algorithm, and an</span>
<span>implementation of that algorithm, that address these issues. First, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports the complete set of</span>
<span>minimum cost repair sequences for a given location, allowing programmers to select the one that</span>
<span>best fits their intention. Second, on a corpus of 200,000 real-world syntactically invalid Java</span>
<span>programs, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>is able to repair 98.37%</span><span>±</span><span>0.017% </span><span>of files within a timeout of 0.5s. Finally,</span>
<span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>uses the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences to reduce the cascading error</span>
<span>problem, where incorrect error recovery causes further spurious syntax errors to be identified.</span>
<span>Across the test corpus, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports 435,812</span><span>±</span><span>473 </span><span>error locations to the user, reducing the</span>
<span>cascading error problem substantially relative to the 981,628</span><span>±</span><span>0 </span><span>error locations reported by panic</span>
<span>mode.</span>

<h3><span>1</span> <a id="x1-10001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 131--><p>Programming is a humbling job which requires acknowledging that we will make untold errors in
our quest to perfect a program. Most troubling are semantic errors, where we intended the
program to do one thing, but it does another. Less troubling, but often no less irritating, are
syntax errors, which are generally minor deviances from the exacting syntax required by a
compiler. So common are syntax errors that parsers in modern compilers are designed to cope
with us making several: rather than stop on the first syntax error, they attempt to
<span>recover </span>from it. This allows them to report, and us to fix, all our syntax errors in one
go.
</p><!--l. 141--><p>When error recovery works well, it is a useful productivity gain. Unfortunately, most current
error recovery approaches are simplistic. The most common grammar-neutral approach to error
recovery are those algorithms described as ‘panic mode’ (e.g.&nbsp;[<a href="#Xholub90compilerdesign">13</a>, p.&nbsp;348]) which skip input until
the parser finds something it is able to parse. A more grammar-specific variation of this
idea is to skip input until a pre-determined synchronisation token (e.g. ‘;’ in Java) is
reached&nbsp;[<a href="#Xdegano95comparison">8</a> , p.&nbsp;3], or to try inserting a single synchronisation token. Such strategies are
often unsuccessful, leading to a cascade of spurious syntax errors (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an
example). Programmers quickly learn that only the location of the first error in a file – not
the reported repair, nor the location of subsequent errors – can be relied upon to be
accurate.

<span>Figure</span><span>&nbsp;1:  </span></span><span><span>An example of a simple, common Java syntax error (</span><a href="#x1-1001r1"><span>a</span></a><span>) and the problems traditional</span>
<span>error recovery has in dealing with it. </span><span>javac </span><span>(</span><a href="#x1-1011r2"><span>b</span></a><span>) spots the error when it encounters ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’. Its error</span>
<span>recovery algorithm then repairs the input by inserting a semicolon before ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’ (i.e.</span><span>&nbsp;making the input</span>
<span>equivalent to ‘</span><span>int x; y;</span><span>’). This then causes a spurious parsing error, since ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’ on its own is not</span>
<span>a valid statement. The </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>error recovery algorithm we introduce in this paper produces the</span>
<span>output shown in (</span><a href="#x1-1005r3"><span>c</span></a><span>): after spotting an error when parsing encounters ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’, it uses the Java grammar</span>
<span>to find the complete  set  of  minimum  cost  repair  sequences  (unlike  previous  approaches  which</span>
<span>non-deterministically find one minimum cost repair sequence). In this case three repair sequences</span>
<span>are reported to the user: one can delete ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’ entirely (‘</span><span>int x;</span><span>’), or insert a comma (‘</span><span>int x, y;</span><span>’), or</span>
<span>insert an equals sign (</span><span>‘int x = y;’</span><span>).</span>

<!--l. 233--><p>It is possible to hand-craft error recovery algorithms for a specific language. These
generally allow better recovery from errors, but are challenging to create. For example,
the Java error recovery approach in the Eclipse IDE is 5KLoC long, making it only
slightly smaller than a modern version of Berkeley Yacc — a complete parsing system!
Unsurprisingly, few real-world parsers contain effective hand-written error recovery
algorithms.
</p><!--l. 240--><p>Most of us are so used to these trade-offs (cheap generic algorithms and poor recovery
vs.&nbsp;expensive hand-written algorithms and reasonable recovery) that we assume them to be
inevitable. However, there is a long line of work on more advanced generic error recovery
algorithms. Probably the earliest such algorithm is Aho and Peterson&nbsp;[<a href="#Xaho72minimum">1</a>], which, upon
encountering an error, creates on-the-fly an alternative (possibly ambiguous) grammar which
allows the parser to recover. This algorithm has fallen out of favour in programming
language circles, probably because of its implementation complexity and the difficulty of
explaining to users what recovery has been used. A simpler family of algorithms, which
trace their roots to Fischer <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xfischer79locally">11</a>], instead try to find a single minimum cost <span>repair</span>
<span>sequence </span>of token insertions and deletions which allow the parser to recover. Algorithms in
this family are much better at recovering from errors than naive approaches and can
communicate the repairs they find in a way that humans can easily replicate. However, such
algorithms have seen little practical use because their typical performance is seen as
poor and their worst case unbounded [<a href="#Xmckenzie95error">17</a>, p.&nbsp;14]. We add a further complaint: such
approaches only report a single repair sequence to users. In general – and especially in
syntactically rich languages – there are multiple reasonable repair sequences for a given
error location, and the algorithm has no way of knowing which best matches the user’s
intentions.
</p><!--l. 261--><p>In this paper we introduce a new error recovery algorithm in the Fischer <span>et al. </span>family, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>.
This takes the approach of Corchuelo <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xcorchuelo02repairing">5</a>] as a base, corrects it, expands it, and
optimises its implementation. <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is simple to implement (under 500 lines of Rust
code), is able to repair nearly all errors in reasonable time, reports the complete set of
minimum cost repair sequences to users, and does so in less time than Corchuelo <span>et</span>
<span>al.</span>.
</p><!--l. 269--><p>We validate <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> on a corpus of 200,000 real, syntactically incorrect, Java programs
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-140006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: experiment --></a>). <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is able to recover 98.37%<span>±</span><span>0.017% </span>of files within a 0.5s timeout and does so
while reporting fewer than half the error locations as a traditional panic mode algorithm: in other
words, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> substantially reduces the cascading error problem. We also show – for, as far as we
know, the first time – that advanced error recovery can be naturally added to a Yacc-esque
system, allowing users to make fine-grained decisions about what to do when error recovery has
been applied to an input (Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-180007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:api --></a>). We believe that this shows that algorithms such as <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>
are ready for wider usage, either on their own, or as part of a multi-phase recovery
system.
</p>
<h4><span>1.1</span> <a id="x1-20001.1"></a>Defining the problem</h4>
<!--l. 285--><p>Formally speaking, we first test the following hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 287--><dl><dt>
<span>H1</span></dt><dd>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences can be found in acceptable time.</dd></dl>
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 292--><p>The only work we are aware of with a similar concept of ‘acceptable time’ is&nbsp;[<a href="#XdeJonge12natural">6</a>], who define it
as the total time spent in error recovery per file, with a threshold of 1s. We use that
definition with one change: Since many compilers are able to fully execute in less than 1s,
we felt that a tighter threshold is more appropriate: we use 0.5s since we think that
even the most demanding users will tolerate such a delay. We strongly validate this
hypothesis.
</p><!--l. 300--><p>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences makes it more likely that the programmer
will see a repair sequence that matches their original intention (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an example;
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#x1-28000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:examples --></a> contains further examples in Java, Lua, and PHP). It also opens up a new
opportunity. Previous error recovery algorithms find a single repair sequence, apply that to the
input, and then continue parsing. While that repair sequence may have been a reasonable local
choice, it may cause cascading errors later. Since we have the complete set of minimum
cost repair sequences available, we can select from that set a repair sequence which
causes fewer cascading errors. We thus rank repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue successfully (up to a threshold — parsing the whole file would, in
general, be too costly), and choose from the subset that gets furthest (note that the
time required to do this is included in the 0.5s timeout). We thus also test a second
hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 315--><dl><dt>
<span>H2</span></dt><dd>Ranking the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue locally reduces the global cascading error problem.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 321--><p>We also strongly validate this hypothesis. We do this by comparing ‘normal’ <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> with a
simple variant <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span><span>rev</span> which reverses the ranking process, always selecting from amongst the
worst …</p></div></div>

<p>What do you get if you create a binary, a few bash scripts, a README and excellent timing? </p><p>An awareness that folks need to understand that ripping code from GitHub and sharing/running without validation can be dangerous. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">today on why people should read code and repos before they run them <a href="https://t.co/calGnBbllS">https://t.co/calGnBbllS</a> exploits 👀9/10 would troll the internet again</p>— Andy Gill (@ZephrFish) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZephrFish/status/1283162770213670915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Before we dive into the actual research, here's what actually happened for those who didn't see the fallout, unless you are in the security space and familiar with what happened last 36 hours, it probably won't make much sense quickly.</p><ol><li>Microsoft has a critical flaw in DNS server which resulted in a CVSS 10, CVE-2020-1350 is a real vulnerability that was published:<br><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1350">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1350</a> It's a brand new vulnerability therefore people would be interested in a proof of concept.</li><li>A security company publishes the info - no public exploit available at the point of publishing this blog, &nbsp;a quick kudos to the team over at Checkpoint Research who found the original vulnerability and published <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/resolving-your-way-into-domain-admin-exploiting-a-17-year-old-bug-in-windows-dns-servers/">a great write up which can be found here.</a></li><li>I created a fake exploit on GitHub minutes after the original blog post was published - playing a prank on hackers and other security companies picking up and publishing in threat intelligence feeds. The code was initially just a bash script then I added a binary loaded with canary tokens to track who was running the script. If anyone is interested Thinkst has a great blog around how canary tokens work <a href="https://blog.thinkst.com/p/canarytokensorg-quick-free-detection.html?m=1">that can be found here.</a></li><li>Lots of people ran the code or helped spread the existence of the fake exploit, folks ran the "proof of concept" code without reading it first and got trolled. If I had been malicious I could have done something much worse than rick-rolling.</li><li>The repository also contains a real fix for the vulnerability. Which can be found here:</li></ol><pre><code>reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters" /v "TcpReceivePacketSize" /t REG_DWORD /d 0xFF00 /f

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In this post I’m going to explore Simple Workflow Service (SWF) available in AWS.</p>

<p>To understand what SWF is good for, we need to first understand what a workflow is. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow">Wikipedia defines it</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In computer systems we care about the part about processing information. Some things that could be modeled as workflows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deployment pipeline</strong>: We could receive some code as input and then build it in a worker machine. We can run tests in parallel in different machines. If all tests pass we can deploy the binaries to another set of machines.</li>
  <li><strong>Coordinate shipments</strong>: A user buys a product on an online store and the order is placed on a system. A human monitors this system and takes care of finding the products in a warehouse and shipping them to the correct address. When the shipment is made, the information is entered in a system. The workflow notices this information an e-mails the user the shipping details.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous image processing</strong>: A system uploads files to a system for processing (let’s say, create thumbnails). A workflow uses multiple workers to execute the task. If any of the machines fails while processing a set of files, they same work can be taken over by another worker.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>Those are some high level examples. In this post I’m going to go over one example in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<p>Before we start building a workflow, let’s learn a little about the components of an SWF:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Workflow</strong>: A set of activities, and some logic that defines how these work together to achieve some objective</li>
  <li><strong>Domain</strong>: A workflow lives in a domain. A Domain can contain multiple workflows. Workflows in different domains can’t interact</li>
  <li><strong>Execution</strong>: An instance of the workflow with its associated state</li>
  <li><strong>Event</strong>: Represents a change on the state of an execution</li>
  <li><strong>Starter</strong>: A program, or person that starts and execution</li>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong>: A type of task that needs to be performed, such as: resizing images, running tests, etc</li>
  <li><strong>Task</strong>: An invocation of an activity</li>
  <li><strong>Worker</strong>: Program that performs tasks</li>
  <li><strong>Decider</strong>: Program that defines the logic for the workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="machine-repair-workflow">Machine repair workflow</h2>

<p>To help us get familiar with SWF, we are going to create a workflow to model the process for fixing a broken machine in a fleet. It will look something like this:</p>

<p>This workflow can be used in a datacenter that runs a lot of machines. We can have the workflow probe machines to see if they are working well. If it notices something wrong, it sets the machine state as <code>maintenance</code> in a database. If it doesn’t find anything wrong, it finishes the execution.</p>

<p>Once a machine is drained we’ll do two things. We’ll have a person take a look at the machine and fix it and we’ll take the oportunity to reimage the machine so we have clean machine when it comes back.</p>

<p>Once the repair and the reimage are done, we can set the state back to <code>available</code> and finish the execution.</p>

<h2 id="getting-ready">Getting ready</h2>

<p>For our activities and the decider, we are going to need the AWS SDK. In this section I’m going to show how to get it ready.</p>

<p>We’ll use Ruby for our examples, since it’s easy to run and it’s very well supported. The latest version of the Ruby SDK at the time of this writing is version 3. We’ll create a <code>Gemfile</code> with dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>source</span> <span>'https://rubygems.org'</span>

<span>gem</span> <span>'aws-sdk-swf'</span><span>,</span> <span>'~&gt; 1'</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then install them using:</p>



<p>The AWS SDK will need to communicate with AWS, so we’ll need some credentials, these credentials can be set in environment variables like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>export </span><span>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>=</span>&lt;your key <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>export </span><span>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>=</span>&lt;your secret&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p>Each of the boxes in the diagram above is an <code>activity</code>. Activities can be pretty self contained, so we’ll start building those.</p>

<p>An activity works by polling the workflow for pending tasks. If it finds that there is a task it can perform, it does so, and returns a result back. Polling then continues until there is more work to do.</p>

<p>Our activities will share some code with the decider, so let’s create a base class that will be shared between them (<code>workflow_base.rb</code>):</p>

    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This class defines some constants that are shared between the decider and activities. It also initializes the SWF client and register the domain if it doesn’t yet exist.</p>

<p>Because of the way SWF works, it is best if the code for all our activities is handled by a single program. This program will poll for any new tasks in the domain. Every time it sees a task it will execute it and send the result back to SWF. Because each task is blocking, we could spin many copies of this program to allow tasks to be executed in parallel if we wanted to.</p>

There were secondary goals such as improving the testing infrastructure, setting up CI/CD, estimating progress and allowing the computation to be paused and resumed.</p><p>Forewarning: I have essentially zero domain knowledge in this project (and fluid dynamics simulation isn’t exactly the kind of topic you can catch up to research level on over a weekend) so I approached this project from a purely software engineering perspective. As for my Rust experience, I’ve been using it for personal projects since ~2016 and I worked as a Rust software engineer at a startup in Berlin for a year after leaving high school.</p><h2 id="dont-rewrite">Don’t Rewrite</h2><p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Don’t.</a></p><p><a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/avoid-rewriting-a-legacy-system-from-scratch-by-strangling-it/">Rewrite.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-i-failed-to-deal-with-legacy-code-8e123cff5bce">Legacy.</a></p><p><a href="https://daedtech.com/the-myth-of-the-software-rewrite/">Code.</a></p><p>Not too hard a concept to grasp, is it? Not much ambiguity and a clear line of reasoning to follow as to why legacy software should not be rewritten. Well I read the articles written by people far more experienced and knowledgable than myself and thought:</p><p><img src="https://mckeogh.tech/post/shallow-water/0e1.png" alt="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read"></p><h2 id="why-my-situation-is-different">Why <em>My</em> Situation is Different</h2><p>All jokes aside, there are situations where a re-implementation is a reasonable option and I did have several factors to back me up.</p><p>FORTRAN is undoubtably <em>very</em> fast and highly suited to HPC problems with decades-optimised compilers and debugging tooling but it does lack certain features, namely memory safety, thread safety, data race guarantees and ergonomic GPU/CLI/TUI libraries.</p><p>Having written parallel software in both C and Rust, the memory safety guarantees and easy parallelisation with Rayon offered by Rust contrasts quite sharply with my poor experience using OpenMP. Replacing <code>.iter()</code> with <code>.par_iter()</code> and having the compiler automatically throw errors for any code that isn’t thread safe is amazing compared with adding OpenMP directive sentinels (designed to be hidden from a non OpenMP-compliant FORTRAN compiler) and manually determining thread and memory safety. Here seems a good a place as any to mention that <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">“~70% of the vulnerabilities Microsoft assigns a CVE each year continue to be memory safety issues”</a>.</p><p>It was believed initially that GPUs could be used to accelerate the computation, ~another place where Rust’s (while not mature) ecosystem also shines above those offered for FORTRAN~ EDIT: completely untrue, FORTRAN’s GPU acceleratin libraries are very mature and production ready. Additionally when it came to the additional requirements building a <code>ncurses</code> interface in FORTRAN isn’t exactly ergonomic compared with the libraries available in Rust. I spent some time reading through the original implementation and attempted some basic parallelisation with little success due to small errors being hard to diagnose across long executions without snapshot testing across multiple modules.</p><p>Not only was there several “pull” factors, but there was also the absence of the typical reasons you shouldn’t rewrite: I was working as a one-person team, the software was finalised and so never needed to be modified again, it was relatively small so could be rewritten in a matter of months (part time) and is not a live business component so uptime and upkeep of the original implementation are irrelevant.</p><p>Given all of this I decided it would be faster to rewrite in Rust, then be able parallelise it and add features quickly than it would be to plough through with the FORTRAN, and with a go-ahead from my supervisor I got to work.</p><h2 id="translating-fortran-to-rust">Translating FORTRAN to Rust</h2><p><em>Relatively</em> straightforward translation of existing codebases in compiled languages to Rust is a noted benefit due to the combination of software like <a href="https://c2rust.com/">C2Rust</a> to perform automatic translation of C source into Rust, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a> for automatically generating FFI bindings and of Cargo’s ability to compile code in other languages as part of a Rust project. While there are plenty examples of large projects successfully migrating to Rust this way, the issue I faced was that it would have required a two-step process, first translating from FORTRAN to C and then from C to Rust. I assumed the likelihood that the resulting code would be remotely parsable was very low and I couldn’t even get either of the most popular FORTRAN to C conversion tools to work.</p><p>Since the original implementation was only 6,000 lines total I decided to go with a manual translation. This involved starting at the base of the module tree with the Fast Fourier Transform routines and working upwards. I kept my process simple by inserting small pieces of FORTRAN to dump state at the beginning and end of routines which was then used for snapshot tests for the Rust implementation. This resulted in a thorough, robust testing suite which was invaluble during the optimization period. I really only made one bad design decision (please don’t read through the git history to confirm this 😅) during the translation phase which was thinking that nested <code>Vec</code>s would be easier than using <code>ndarray</code> from the start. This was a Bad Decision™️ and wasted so much time, not only in the abysmal execution speeds slowing down <code>cargo test</code>, but also in that it significantly increased development time. I would replace a statement such as</p><p>with</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Awful, awful Rust
</span><span></span><span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..x {
	<span>for</span> j <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..y {
		a[i][j] <span>=</span> a[i][j] <span>*</span> b[i][j]
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>when the final <code>ndarray</code> version would look like</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Ergonomic Rust
</span><span></span>a <span>*=</span> <span>&amp;</span>b;
</code></pre></div><p>Clearly the intermediary step could have been skipped and a more direct translation was possible. I wrote a regex to replace FORTRAN array indexing syntax (<code>array(x,y,z)</code>) to nested <code>Vec</code>s in Rust (<code>array[x][y][z]</code>), when <code>ndarray</code> syntax (<code>array[[x,y,z]]</code>) would have been a far simpler conversion. If this decision wasn’t bad enough, I also wasted time writing several functions to convert between a byte slice and the nested <code>Vec</code>s with the FORTRAN memory layout when <code>ndarray</code> has a built-in preset for FORTRAN shape and strides.</p><p>One issue that arose during testing was that due to the accumulation of small errors in floating point math, results would be slightly different between operating systems and hardware configurations which made the fantastic snapshot testing tool <code>insta</code> unsuitable. Instead <code>ndarray</code>’s <code>serde</code> and <code>approx</code> feature flags are used to read serialised arrays from disk to compare approximately during tests which has been working well.</p><h2 id="optimizing">Optimizing</h2><h3 id="parallelisation">Parallelisation</h3><p>Fundamentally the problem is not one that may be described as “embarrassingly parallel”, which was the assumption made going into the project (early discussions involved expectations of a 100x improvement on the university cluster). Ideally we would be want many large chunks of independent computation operating on a small amount of data, making it easy to distribute work across threads, GPUs and potentially different machines, but unfortunately I learned this problem is quite far from that ideal.</p><p>The outermost loop advances through time and is therefore strictly sequential, and in the primary function of the program (<code>src/nhswps/advance.rs:advance</code>) a large portion is iterated over twice, also strictly sequential. Some other lower-level functions perform operations on individual layers and so can be parallelised completely, but these are not generally very complex functions and so finish quickly before returning to sequential execution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> comes into affect here, describing how even if everything that can be parallelised is, there are fundamental limits to the scaling we can ever achieve.</p><h3 id="memory-bandwidth-issues">Memory Bandwidth Issues</h3><p>Throughout the program there are several kinds of operations being performed on the 2- and 3-dimensional arrays. Transformations between physical and spectral is common, involving calling the Fourier transform functions and swapping axes. Other than those, many operations are simple additions, subtractions and multiplications between arrays, sometimes including constants. The result of this is that these simple operations are being performed on some very large amounts of data which I believe is resulting in a memory bandwidth bottleneck. This hypothesis explains why SIMD did not improve performance and performance is not significantly improved by parallelisation. It only takes several cycles to perform a floating point ADD or MUL instruction, so even at tens of gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth it will be insufficient to keep the CPU “fed”. Performing the operations with AVX-2 instructions does not improve performance because even though the same operation may now be performed on several floats simultaneously the limit is still how quickly they may be read from memory. It is slightly more complicated in the multithreaded context because there is an improvement in performance; perhaps due to multiple threads being able to increase the amount of data read from memory. The program is also very cache-unfriendly, reading large amounts of data in only to perform a simple, fast operation before reading in new data. At several gigabytes in size even individual layers aren’t even close to being able to reside in on-die cache. I am unsure of how I might collect proof of my hypothesis but I believe it explains a great deal of the behaviours I’ve witnessed throughout this project.</p><h3 id="gpu-unsuitability">GPU Unsuitability</h3><p>There was also some hope at the beginning of the project that GPUs could be used but there are two main reasons they are unsuitable.</p><p>Firstly, ~GPUs with large amounts of VRAM (128GB+) simply aren’t available~ EDIT: I was wrong, <em>commercial</em> gaming and workstation GPUs don’t get that large, but there are plenty of datacentre options, like the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/announcing-google-cloud-a2-vm-family-based-on-nvidia-a100-gpu">A100</a>. There is the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/professional-graphics/radeon-pro-ssg">Radeon Pro SSG</a> which is a really interesting product but the memory bandwidth of …</p></article></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-8890"><div><div><div><p>VK social networking website and Telegram messenger App founder and developer, Pavel Durov wants Apple to let iPhone users install different App stores other than Apple App Store. Not only that, but he also wants legislation to make this happen.</p><p>Speaking at the panel discussion with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and representatives of the IT industry in Innopolis, Telegram Manager and Vice President, Ilya Perekopsky said that Apple and Google are holding back the development of startups by charging a tax of 30 percent commission from app developers. Immediately after Perekopsky’s speech,&nbsp;Durov published an article in which he called for legislation mandating Apple to be legally obliged to allow users to install an alternative App Store on the iPhone. Durov says that Tim Cook, Apple CEO should be obligated to this at the legislative level.</p><p>Durov is taking the bull by its horn. Apple has been successful because of its closed technology. It not only does not allow any other App store to be installed on iPhones but it also takes action against any iPhone jailbreaks that happen. We all know that the <a href="https://androidrookies.com/unc0ver-jailbreak-tool-for-iphone-released-works-on-all-ios-versions-including-ios-13-5/">uc0ver team released a jailbreak</a> exploiting the previously unknown vulnerability in iOS just hours after Apple released iOS 13.5. The <a href="https://androidrookies.com/kernel-vulnerability-unc0ver-jailbreak-patched-as-apple-releases-ios-13-5-1/">iPhone jailbreak was shut down in iOS 13.5.1</a> within days by Apple. Many private iPhone App stores exist like Cydia, Xabsi, etc but they work only on jailbroken iPhones.</p><p>Much of Apple’s profit is from selling content on its App stores. In fact, Apple’s App Store platform grossed around $50 billion for App store in 2019, according to an analysis by CNBC. Apple takes 30 percent commission from App developers to make their apps available on Apple Store. Last year it paid $35 billion to developers from the App store revenue and kept $15 billion for itself.</p><p>Durov has reasons for being mad at Apple for not allowing other App stores. Durov says that Russian startups fail to make money by paying 30% to Apple. “Preventing two supranational corporations from collecting taxes from all of humanity is not an easy task. Corporations employ thousands of lobbyists, lawyers, and PR agents, and their budgets are unlimited. At the same time, app developers are scattered and scared, as the fate of their projects depends entirely on the favor of Apple and Google,” wrote Pavel Durov.</p><p>Durov also has a personal bias for wanting Apple to open up its iOS for alternative App stores. In 2016, Apple banned the Telegram team from launching its own game platform. This hurt Durov and Telegram’s ambitions, “We had to remove the telegram games catalog that we had already created and almost the entire platform interface, otherwise Apple threatened to remove Telegram from the AppStore.”</p><p>Recently, <a href="https://androidrookies.com/apple-threatens-to-remove-hey-com-email-app-unless-it-pays-outrageous-cuts-to-them/">email client, Hey.com</a> had a similar experience with Apple regarding publishing their App on the Apple App store.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For a while I’ve been intending to make my website more sustainable, but I succumbed, as I often do, to the human trait of sloth. But this morning after reading <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/">Gerry McGovern’s post on webwaste</a>, I thought I’d procrastinated long enough.</p>

<p>So I ran a web page performance test and got some <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_XX_e2daed33a24cd8a099d930fc373b1083/">grim results</a>: my website takes over a minute to load on a Moto G4 on using 3G data networks. It’s just as bad <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_6E_4e249b485a45882604420068caa21ae0/">using a desktop PC in Nottingham on 1.5Mbps DSL</a>. My website is bloated with large images and a bunch of JavaScript, which means it’s eating up lots of energy transmitting those bits and bytes.</p>

<p>But how much energy? I used the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon Calculator</a> to find out. Turns out that</p>

<ul>
  <li>6.90g of CO2 is produced every time someone visits the homepage</li>
  <li>it emits the amount of carbon that 4 trees absorb in a year, and</li>
  <li>it uses enough electricity to drive an electric car 1,116km</li>
</ul>

<p>Eugh. That’s disgusting. For each year my website has been online, I should have planted 4 trees just for the homepage alone. But, instead, my laziness has filled the atmosphere with more and more carbon.</p>

<p>I have to do something, this has gone on long enough, so I’m committing to some actions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’ll move my site to a web hosting provider using renewable energy, one that’s listed on the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/">Green Web Foundation’s directory</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll compress and optimise the images on my site using <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac">ImageOptim</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll get rid of <a href="https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll">my energy-guzzling site theme</a> until I can introduce one that’s lightweight and accessible. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>Going forward, my website will enshrine the principles of the <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a>. <strong>SIGNED</strong></li>
  <li><strong>NEW</strong>: I’ll pay for some trees to be planted that’ll reduce the impact of my website’s carbon footprint going forward.</li>
</ol>

<p>To show my committment to being a good web citizen, I’ll add the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/">Website Carbon Badge</a> to all pages (<strong>DONE</strong>) and the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/">Green Web Foundation’s renewable hosting badge</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>). Once I’ve improved things, I’ll add a <a href="https://carbontxt.org/">carbon.txt</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>).</p>

<p>One day I’ll actually get around to building a solar-powered battery bank and run my site off my home connection, but until then I’m taking small steps to remove, minimise and clean-up my presence on the web.</p>

<p>What’s the carbon footprint of your website? What steps will you take to reduce it?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>We are incredibly excited to announce that <strong>Riot is now Element</strong>! </p><p>In fact we have simplified all our naming: Element is also the name for New Vector (the company behind Riot) while Modular, our flagship Matrix hosting service, has become Element Matrix Services.</p><p>For those discovering us for the first time: Element is the flagship secure collaboration app for the decentralised <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> communication network. &nbsp;Element lets you own your own end-to-end encrypted chat server, while still connecting to everyone else in the wider Matrix network.</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/element-logo.png"></figure><p><br>What’s more, <strong>RiotX is now out of beta</strong> - our next generation Matrix client for Android has flown the nest and spread its wings as Element - replacing the old Riot Android app at last!</p><p>This name change has been a long time in the making. As we explained when we announced the rebrand <a href="https://blog.riot.im/the-world-is-changing/">a few weeks ago</a>, we’ve had major issues with a certain gigantic games company which has blocked us from being able to trademark Riot or even Riot.im - a huge issue when it comes to defending users against abusive forks of the app. Secondly, people incorrectly assume Riot refers to violence, rather than the more constructive forms of chaos we had in mind. Lastly, it made sense in the early days of Matrix to have different brands to illustrate the different roles of Riot, Modular and New Vector in the ecosystem… but nowadays there are loads of Matrix clients, Matrix hosting providers and companies building on Matrix - and so all New Vector’s different names were just causing confusion. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="so-why-element">So, why Element?</h3><p>We want a name that reflects the emphasis on simplicity and clarity that we aimed for when designing RiotX; a name that highlights our single-minded mission to make Element the most elegant and usable mainstream comms app imaginable. &nbsp;Riot had a pretty chequered history, spending much of its life in beta, with intermittent attention to design until we hit 1.0 last year - but nowadays we have a dedicated full-time design team working on Element, who not only design the graphics but the overall behaviour of new features in the app. &nbsp;This is not an easy task, given it turns out the hardest bits of end-to-end encryption are almost entirely UX challenges. &nbsp;What’s more, presenting a global decentralised communication network as simply as a centralised communication island is surprisingly tricky. &nbsp;However: we have been making massive progress, to the extent that we are barely recognisable as the Riot of the past. Element reflects a clean start to focus monomaniacally on mainstream usability in future.</p><p>We also want a name that better evokes the idea of data ownership and self-sovereignty. &nbsp;An element is the smallest indivisible thing in a system - yet one which can stand alone. &nbsp;You can customise it, control it and make it your own - you can literally be in your Element!</p><p>Moreover, we want a name that will be future-proof for peer-to-peer Matrix. &nbsp;As Matrix.org announced last month, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix">P2P Matrix is in heavy development</a> - and we can see a world where Element will literally be an element of Matrix, running your own homeserver within the app, so you can communicate if you don’t have a server… or even Internet. In fact, we published the first experimental build of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/07/10/this-week-in-matrix-2020-07-10#riot-ios-p2p-demo">P2P Riot for iOS</a> on Testflight a few days ago - so we can clearly see a future where we will be in our P2P element!</p><p>Finally, we think it’s a cool name :D &nbsp;It fits in nicely with the term Matrix while not being as nerdy as Vector. &nbsp;We’re obviously aware that Element is (once again) both a dictionary word and a mathematical term - but in practice, looking at search results for Element right now, the top hits are for dictionary sites(!) and the field is wide open. &nbsp;Conversely, in a virgin browser on VPN, Riot is the 4th hit on Google for Riot; second only to a certain games company. &nbsp;In other words, we’ve shown that we can successfully adopt dictionary words - and if you do find yourself lost searching in a maze of mathematics, just throw in the word ‘chat’ to get back on track. &nbsp;(For all the linear algebraists who are spitting with rage at this point: we promise we’ll make it up to you by finally sorting out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3251">latex support</a> in Element!)</p><p>This change is inevitably going to be disruptive, and we’re painfully aware that we’ve spent four years building up Riot’s reputation and persuading everyone to move their friends, families and teams onto it. &nbsp;To reiterate what we said when we announced the change, we know that many people reading this will have put their necks on the line to get folks to adopt Riot, and we really appreciate how frustrating it may be to have to explain the change to your users. &nbsp;However, this is unquestionably the right time to shed our skin and make the change, and we hope folks will grow to love Element much more than they ever did Riot. &nbsp;To aid the transition, we’ve named the installable apps “Element (Riot.im)” for a while to help people get reoriented (e.g. when searching by name for Riot).</p><p>Last but not least: Element isn’t just a new name - it comes with a massive suite of improvements across Android, iOS and Web.</p><p>We’ll write about these in full over the coming days, but the big headlines are that RiotX (our ground-up rewrite of Riot Android) has exited beta, and replaces Riot Android as Element - complete with VoIP calls and Widget support! Riot Android users will magically autoupgrade into Element; the old RiotX app will be retired in due course. FDroid is likely releasing Element as an entirely new app. &nbsp;Meanwhile On iOS we now have full support for iOS 13, complete with entirely new push notification support (thanks to Apple’s nightmarish <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/05/secure-messaging-apps-working-to-comply-with-apples-ios-13-privacy-changes">deprecation of PushKit</a>).</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/RiotX-1.png"><figcaption>The App Formerly Known As RiotX!</figcaption></figure><p>On Element Web, we’ve given the UI a massive refresh, with a beautiful new font (<a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>) giving much improved legibility, and we’ve <strong>completely</strong> rewritten the Room List control - adding in room previews(!!), alphabetic ordering, resizable lists, improved notification UI and more. We’ve also landed the first phase of further improving the end-to-end encryption setup process - letting users generate a recovery key rather than forcing them to select a recovery passphrase when setting up E2EE for the first time (the next phase is to delay setting up E2EE until the user actually starts talking in encrypted rooms).</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-15-at-00.54.45.png"></figure><p>So there you have it. Welcome to a whole new beginning for Riot: welcome to your new Element, one where mainstream Matrix users will enjoy themselves too - and which will pave the way for wider adoption of open, secure, decentralised communication via Matrix throughout the world.</p><p>- Matthew, Amandine, and the whole Element team.</p><p>P.S. Check out our <a href="https://element.io/">all-new website</a> and in particular the <a href="https://element.io/previously-riot">migration page</a> for much more information about our brave new world!<br></p></div></div>]]>

But it does more than blast stack traces into your inbox: Sentry provides powerful workflows to help your team determine root cause, <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/02/07/sentry-workflow-triage">triage issues</a> to your team, and keep tabs on ongoing concerns with comments and notifications.</p>
<p>These collaborative features can help you resolve problems with your software quickly. But the keyword here is <strong>collaborative</strong>; without your full team having access to Sentry, you may find yourself quickly becoming overwhelmed with an endless backlog of issues and no one to help.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, the Growth team made it our mission to make it easier for our users to invite their teammates to join them on Sentry. To achieve this, we tackled three distinct areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Surfacing the ability to invite users contextually</li>
<li>Expanding Sentry’s permission model to allow <em>more types of users</em> to send invitations </li>
<li>Allowing external users to request access themselves</li>
</ol>
<p>Our theory: improving the user experience of inviting users, <em>as well as</em> democratizing the process to include all team members would lead to a significant increase in team-wide adoption. <em>(Narrator: it did.)</em></p>

<p>This full-page experience, tucked away deep in Sentry’s account settings, had a number of issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since this is a full page, reaching it meant you would be taken out of context of whatever you were doing previously</li>
<li>Its location deep in our navigation hierarchy meant discoverability was poor</li>
<li>It’s <em>unclear</em> you can actually invite multiple people at once (you can!)</li>
<li>When inviting multiple users, you could only assign the group to the same role and collection of teams</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, to improve discoverability, we had previously introduced a number of “quick links” to reach this page more easily. But these links were scattered around the application, and didn’t appear contextually when users signaled intent to invite members.</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/4xiHp1Gl0HaZ0l8USGDPLr/79402583357d98cf55ad2dfda6ffe537/2-invitations.png" alt="" title="2-invitations"></p></figure><div>
<p>These user experience and discovery challenges felt like obvious starting places. But instead of just settling for a new “improved” form, we decided to rethink the entire experience from the ground up.</p>

</a>The new member invitation modal</h2>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that our first instinct was to convert this page into a modal –&nbsp;one that manages to squeeze all of the capabilities shown earlier into a smaller, more concise experience. It actually does one better: the modal is clearer in indicating that you can invite multiple users, and allows you to set unique permissions for each invitee.</p>

<p>While modals are sometimes overused in web applications, we believed this approach would solve our key discoverability and navigation concerns: it can be shown contextually without leaving the current page, and completing the form returns you to what you were doing.</p>
<p>To that point, we additionally introduced buttons to launch this <em>Invite New Members</em> modal contextually throughout Sentry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing an issue and notice a <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/releases/?platform=node#after-associating-commits">suspect commit</a> made by a coworker? If they’re not already part of your Sentry organization, you can now invite them then and there.</li>
<li>Trying to assign an issue to a team member, but don’t see their name in the assignee list? You now have the option to invite them right in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Creating a new team? Now you can invite new members directly to that team as you go.</li>
</ul>

</a>Democratizing invitations</h2>
<p>As we began rolling out our new <em>Invite New Members</em> experience across the application, we came to a sobering realization: only roughly <strong><em>half</em></strong> of Sentry users could actually use our new modal. That’s because historically, only those with Owner or Manager-level permissions could invite other team members. Combined, users with these permissions accounted for less than 50% of active users.</p>

<p>Restricting the ability to add new users to account administrators is pretty common practice for software tools, and Sentry is no exception. When an employee onboards on a new team, it’s common to see an exchange like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh awesome, we use Sentry. Can you add me to the organization?
Bob: Ah, I can’t invite you. Maybe ask Jen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a perfect world, one of your administrators is tracked down, and they manually add the new teammate to the account. But sometimes that person is unknown, or is on a vacation, or maybe it takes them days or weeks or even months.</p>
<p>We began asking ourselves: what if we could unlock team members to fast-track this whole process and invite members themselves? This led to our next major change: updating our permission model to allow for <strong>members to request to invite other members.</strong></p>

<p>Now, when non-administrators open up the Invite New Members modal, it changes contextually to become a “request to invite” rather than a direct invitation. Hitting “send” kicks off an email to all organization administrators, who are prompted to approve any outstanding requests.</p>

<p>At this point, we had built what we thought was a fantastic new user experience and we just <em>doubled</em> the number of users who could take advantage of it. But this exercise of opening up user invitations got us thinking: what if there was an even <em>further</em> source of untapped users we weren’t reaching?</p>

</a>Removing the middleman entirely</h2>
<p>In the last section, we highlighted a scenario where one teammate asks another teammate for access to Sentry. And because of our recent changes, users can request to invite their teammates themselves instead of having to track down and ask their account administrator.</p>
<p>But this scenario still has a gatekeeping element: the new teammate has to ask <em>another</em> teammate for access. What if the new teammate spots an alert from Sentry in Slack stemming from their recent changes, and no one’s around to grant them access? Unfortunately, they’d land on an authentication wall that would prevent them from going any further.</p>

<p>This begged the question: was there an untapped source of potential users we weren’t reaching by restricting invitations <em>only</em> to active Sentry users? What if new users didn’t have to ask anyone at all?</p>
<p>So, to keep this party going, we dug in and additionally made it possible for <strong>external users to request to join an organization</strong>.</p>

<p>Now when a user lands on an Organization’s login page, they have the option to “Request to join”, which asks for the user’s name and email address. Once they hit send, the organization owners are sent an email that prompts them to approve the join request. Just in case, there’s also a call-to-action to disable the feature entirely for their organization.</p>

<p>Having developed a new contextual invitation modal and a pair of invite-friendly permission changes, we were <em>feeling</em> confident that these changes were going to have a strong impact on user behavior. It was time now to put our money where our code was, and verify that all this hard work actually moved the needle.</p>

</a>A/B testing the impact</h2>
<p>Our standard procedure for validating the efficacy of product changes is through A/B testing (also known as split testing). This means instrumenting our application code to serve different experiences to segments of users over the same time period, and comparing the results. This step takes extra effort, but it’s worth it –&nbsp;the alternative is to settle for a before-and-after snapshot of data, which is too easily impacted by external factors like seasonality or marketing pushes.</p>
<p>ℹ️ <em>To learn more about how we perform A/B testing at Sentry, please see <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/05/09/easy-ab-testing-with-planout">this earlier blog post</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s easy to get carried away with A/B testing, and having so many permutations that you don’t have enough data to be statistically significant. So, to simplify things, we decided that all treatments would get the new modal experience, and our “treatment” groups would focus on the new permission changes.</p>
<p>This left us with 4 distinct treatments that we rolled out to 4 equally-sized customer segments:</p>

<li><strong>Baseline</strong> (new modal only)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Invite</strong> (user invites another user)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Join</strong> (external user requests to join)</li>
<li><strong><em>Both</em></strong> Request to Invite and Request to Join are enabled together</li>
</ol>
<p>Our main criteria for determining success: which of these treatments would result in <strong>an increase in <em>accepted</em> invitations</strong> (and thus new users)?</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/rlobEVJ4FCzWbU1tmPqqb/8ed779f9a63aa3382e5590cfa8e4bec1/11-invitations_2_.png" alt="" title="11-invitations"></p><figcaption><p>% of accepted invitations relative to baseline</p></figcaption></figure><div>
<p>After 30 days, the results became clear (not to mention, statistically significant):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>11%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Invite</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>9%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Join</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>21%</strong> more users accepted invitations who had both <em>Request to Invite</em> and <em>Request to Invite</em> treatments enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that allowing a wider set of users to invite team members resulted in more users inviting team members. It’s also probably not a surprise that enabling both feature sets at the same time was even better (given that they complement each other)!</p>

                  <p>
                      Today I’m excited to announce Snorkel AI’s launch out of stealth!
                      Snorkel AI, which spun out of the Stanford AI Lab in 2019, was founded on two simple premises: first, that the labeled <b>training data</b>  machine learning models learn from is increasingly what determines the success or failure of AI applications.
                      And second, that we can do much better than labeling this data entirely by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      At the Stanford AI lab, the Snorkel AI founding team spent over four years developing new <b>programmatic</b> approaches to labeling, augmenting, structuring, and managing this training data.
                      We were fortunate to develop and deploy early versions of our technology with some of the world’s leading organizations like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/harnessing-organizational-knowledge-for.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3329486.3329492">Intel</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05372">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300192">Stanford Medicine</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology#reference">over thirty-six peer-reviewed publications</a> on our findings; innovations in weak supervision modeling, data augmentation, multi-task learning, and more; inclusion in university computer science curriculums; and deployments in popular products and systems that you’ve likely interacted with in the last few hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Through all this academic tinkering and industry spelunking, we realized two things: first, that this concept of labeling and building training data programmatically, rather than by hand, had transformational potential to make machine learning more iterative, auditable, faster to deploy, and ultimately, more practical.
                      And second, that these ideas changed not just how you label training data, but so much of the entire lifecycle and pipeline of ML: how knowledge and feedback is injected; how models are constructed, trained, versioned, and monitored; how entire pipelines are developed iteratively; and how the full set of stakeholders in any ML deployment, from subject matter experts to ML engineers, are incorporated into the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In other words, we saw that this shift to programmatic training data required a top-to-bottom rewrite of the entire ML development and deployment process.
                      With the support of some amazing investors (Greylock, GV, In-Q-Tel, and others) and incredible early customers, we’ve spent the last year doing just this: building and deploying <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/platform">Snorkel Flow</a>, an end-to-end platform to support this new vision of the ML process.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The Training Data Bottleneck</h2>
                  <p>
                      Snorkel Flow was motivated first and foremost by a growing realization that training data had become the key bottleneck in much of ML pipeline and AI application development.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Today’s ML successes often rest on a hidden cost: massive, hand-labeled training datasets.</b>
                      In the last decade, we’ve seen a tectonic shift in AI and ML towards powerful but data-hungry representation learning models.
                      These models—often deep learning architectures—are not only more powerful at obviating traditionally manual development tasks like feature engineering and bespoke model design, but also have never been more accessible in the open source.
                      However, there’s no such thing as a free lunch: these models are highly complex, with tens to hundreds of millions of parameters, and they require massive labeled training datasets to learn from.
                      And, other than in special scenarios where labels are naturally derivative of existing processes, these training datasets need to be labeled by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The hand-labeled training data interface to ML has enabled tremendous progress, but is also ridiculously broken.</b>
                      Consider a simple example: a legal analyst at a bank wants to train a contract classification model, and wants to inject a simple heuristic into the ML model: that if “employment” is in the title, the contract should be labeled as an “Employment contract.”
                      Simple, right?
                      Not so.
                      Theoretically, to communicate this specific feature to a machine learning model via only labeling individual data points could require thousands of examples (roughly, inversely proportional to the sparsity of the feature space).
                      From this perspective, it’s like playing 20 questions rather than just communicating the answer directly—fine if you have a massive question-answer bank, but otherwise wholly impractical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Manually labeling training data is prohibitively expensive–especially when expertise and privacy are required.</b>
                      Building training datasets often requires <a href="http://nytimes.com/2018/11/25/business/china-artificial-intelligence-labeling.html">armies of human labelers</a> at massive cost and time expense.
                      For example, ImageNet—one of the foundational projects behind ML’s current explosive progress—took <a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/">over two years</a> to create.
                      However, labeling cats, dogs, stop signs, and pedestrians is one thing; labeling data like medical images, legal and financial contracts, government documents, user data, and network data requires <b>stringent privacy protections</b> and <b>subject matter expert labelers</b>.
                      This means for sectors like financial services, government, telecommunications, insurance, healthcare, and more, creating training data (and by extension, using ML) is either a hugely expensive on-premise activity—or more often, one that is just not feasible to tackle, let alone practical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Iterative development is not possible with hand-labeled data.</b>
                      From an engineering and data science perspective, manually labeled training data fundamentally breaks the ability to quickly iterate, which is absolutely essential in real world settings where input data, output goals, and annotation schema change all the time.
                      From a business perspective, training data is an expensive asset that can’t be reused across projects, can often depreciate to worthless overnight due to changing conditions or business goals, and that presents growing risks—everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200703104247/https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/data-labeling/docs">COVID-related delays</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">issues of bias</a>.
                  </p>
                  <h2>A New Input Paradigm for ML: Programming with Data</h2>
                  <p>
                      With Snorkel Flow, rather than needing to hand-label any training data, users develop <b>programmatic operators</b> that label, augment, and build training data to drive the ML development process.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Programmatically labeling and building training data.</b>
                      With Snorkel Flow, the idea is to instead communicate this domain knowledge directly via a programmatic operator like a <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly">labeling function</a>.
                      For example, our legal analyst could write a labeling function that labels documents as “Employment contracts” if the word “employment” is in the title, and otherwise abstains; or, a range of more complex and powerful labeling functions relying on internal knowlegebases, models, legacy heuristics, and more.
                      This approach of effectively programming ML with data is simple, direct, interpretable, modifiable, and agnostic to the model used (which is especially important given the ongoing Cambrian explosion of powerful new open source model architectures).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The directness of rules with the flexibility of ML.</b>
                      Rule-based systems have long been used in industry for certain tasks—as an input, individual rules have the desirable property of being direct and interpretable.
                      However, rules can also be brittle, and lack the robustness, flexibility, and sheer power of ML approaches.
                      With Snorkel Flow, you get the best of both worlds: rules (and other interpretable resources) as inputs, and powerful ML models that generalize beyond these rules as the output.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>A more powerful yet weaker supervision.</b>
                      At the same time that this programmatic supervision is advantageous in several transformational ways, it is also messier and raises fundamental new technical challenges.
                      The labeling functions and other programmatic operators that users write will have varying unknown accuracies and expertise areas, will overlap and disagree with each other, and may be correlated in tangled and unknown ways.
                      We focused on the algorithmic and systems solutions to these issues over <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology">four-plus years of research</a>, showing both empirically and theoretically that with the right techniques, these deep technical challenges can be overcome.
                      The result: training data that is as good as or better than hand-labeled data, and immensely more practical to create and maintain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Beyond labeling: data augmentation, slicing, monitoring, and more.</b>
                      In high-performance production ML, training data is about a lot more than labeling.
                      For example, data augmentation is a cornerstone technique wherein transformed copies of data (e.g. rotated or blurred images) are used to expand the sizes of training datasets, and make resulting models more robust.
                      Slicing or structuring training datasets into more or less important and difficult subsets is also a critical part of managing production ML. 
                      Finally, monitoring and adapting not just models but …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of today’s best bloggers in the functional programming space is <a href="https://chrispenner.ca/">Chris Penner</a>. Despite this, Chris is criminally underrated—nobody I talk to seems to know of his work. Go check him out as soon as you finish reading this post!</p>
<p>This is reasonably pervasive phenomenon in our subculture; there’s lots of fantastic work being produced, but for one reason or another, it falls between the cracks. I’d propose the biggest obstacle is that most FP writing <em>isn’t optimized to be read.</em></p>
<p>So I’d like to take some time today and talk about common failure modes in technical writing. If you don’t have a checklist you run through before publishing a post, you’ll probably get a lot of benefit from internalizing this advice.</p>
<p>The value? You’ll make it easier for people to understand what you’re trying to tell them. Which is why you’re writing in the first place, right? The good news is that none of this is magic—just some simple guidelines for structuring your content.</p>
<h2 id="the-guiding-principle">The Guiding Principle</h2>
<p>Here’s the biggest thing to keep in mind: your reader doesn’t really care what you have to say. You get maybe four sentences to convince them that your essay is worth their time. If you haven’t made your case by then, you’ve probably lost them to the next tab they binge-opened.</p>
<p>Even after you’ve convinced them that it’s a valuable read, you need to continue assuring them that you’re not wasting their time. If you take too long to get to the point, or if you make the information too hard to find on a quick skim, you’ve lost them again.</p>
<p>As a result, alongside your technical content, you have two primary goals to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide strong, concise motivations for everything you want to talk about.</li>
<li>Make it easy to skim.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can do these two things, you’re already most of the way to better engagement.</p>
<h2 id="writing-strong-motivations">Writing Strong Motivations</h2>
<p>People care about solutions to problems they have, or expect to have one day. They care about other things too, but it’s not really relevant to us today.</p>
<p>With this in mind, you want to tailor your motivations in terms of <em>solutions to problems.</em></p>
<p>Here are some good examples of problems that you’ve probably run into (and links to their solutions for you to read later):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrispenner.ca/posts/adjunction-battleship">Ed Kmett writes shitty documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/higher-kinded-data/">I have lots of types that need to evolve at the same time</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thinkingwithtypes.com/">There is no good place to learn type-level programming</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Bad examples of motivating documents are things that assume you care <em>simply because they exist.</em> This is <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.9/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html">pretty</a> <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Yesod-tutorial-for-newbies/">common</a> of libraries’ tutorials. The same document that convinces you to use a technology should also show you how.</p>
<p>As a more general rule, focusing on <em>why</em> is going to be more valuable than on <em>how.</em></p>
<p>Why should someone care, and why your solution is a good one.</p>
<p>“How” without a “why” suggests a contrived solution to a made-up problem. In other words, it’s easily read as “who cares?”</p>
<h2 id="understanding-how-people-read">Understanding How People Read</h2>
<p>People who spend lots of time reading have good heuristics for skipping lots of text. If you understand these heuristics, you can make it easy for people to find what they’re looking for. And remember: they’re looking for reasons to continue reading.</p>
<p>There are two behaviors here. The first is what I call “skimming for concepts”—which is that people will attempt to determine what text is about at a high-level. They’re looking for <em>what you’re trying to tell them</em>, as opposed to <em>what you’re actually saying.</em></p>
<p>When skimming, people are likely to read only the headings and the first two sentences of a paragraph. If they’re convinced they know what you have to say, they’ll skip to the next paragraph. If several paragraphs in a row don’t seem relevant, they’ll skip to the next heading.</p>
<p>If the next heading also fails to grab their attention, they’ll probably give up.</p>
<p>The solution is to structure your argument as a tree. Headings must provide enough information to let someone know whether or not they care about the following prose.</p>
<p>This also means that the first sentence of each paragraph should be sufficient to understand the rest of the paragraph. The remaining sentences are only allowed to reinforce or give details of the first sentence. One paragraph equals one idea.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the hierarchy of your document should look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document
<ul>
<li>Heading
<ul>
<li>First sentence
<ul>
<li>Rest of paragraph</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you feel like it’s hard to know how much knowledge to assume your readership knows. Understanding how people read makes this a non-issue. Present as much information as is necessary to understand your point, but make it easy to skip if people already know it. Those who don’t yet know will learn, those who do can skip past, and both camps will appreciate it.</p>
<p>After you’ve convinced your reader that they care what you have to say, they’re more willing to read what you <em>actually have to say.</em> When the reader is ready to dive in, that’s when you can make the finer points of your argument.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that anyone is going to read every word of your essay. It’s even less likely that they’ll read them all in order.</p>
<h2 id="stumbling-blocks">Stumbling Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve got people ready to listen to you, it’s important to keep them on the same page as you. You really need to stay on top of anything that might break their focus.</p>
<p>Use short sentences. If it’s too hard to parse, people won’t.</p>
<p>Make sure your spelling and grammar have no egregious problems. You don’t need to have perfect command of the language, but you need to be able to signal that you’re trustworthy-enough to listen to. Don’t underestimate how much credibility you’ll lose from blatantly bad spelling and grammar.</p>
<p>This stuff is relatively common-sense.</p>
<p>What might be less so is that you also need to stay on top of conceptual stumbling blocks. If your argument makes a jump that feels poorly motivated or references something potentially unfamiliar, expect that your reader will experience vertigo.</p>
<p>Most of the ideas we talk about in functional programming <em>are not easy,</em> and it doesn’t do anyone any favors to pretend this isn’t so. Expect that your readers will be pretty similar to you; if you had a problem understanding a piece of your topic, <em>call that out.</em> Point out the obstacle. Point out what they might be thinking, and then very explicitly show them what they should be thinking instead.</p>
<p>For example, if your code sample uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_dependency">functional dependency</a>, it might be worth a short sentence saying “that funny bar thing is a functional dependency.” Give a tiny summary of its purpose, and provide a link for them to learn more if they need to.</p>
<p>Another illustration: if <em>you</em> originally got confused that an “algebra in recursion schemes” is not the same thing as the algebra you learned in high-school, your readers probably will too. The first time you say “algebra” in the new context, say “this is a misleading term. This has nothing to do with solving equations like you did in high-school.”</p>
<p>More important than what you’re saying is what you’re <em>not saying.</em> If you’re giving examples of something that fits a pattern, make sure you give examples of things that <em>do not</em> fit the pattern. A concept that is applicable everywhere is useful nowhere.</p>
<p>Give lots of examples. Nobody I know learns via mathematical statements, nor do they learn via long, wordy, abstract prose. People learn by seeing lots of examples, and being told explicitly how these examples relate to one another. The mathematical statements are only useful <em>after</em> you have the intuition, so save them for an appropriate time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The takeaway advice from this essay is that <em>if you want lots of readers, you must make it easy for them to read.</em></p>
<p>To that end, pay lots of attention to motivation. Why should people care what you have to say? What value does it give <em>them?</em></p>
<p>Focus your energy on the beginnings—both of the essay as a whole, and of each paragraph. People who are unconvinced by your essay’s value will skim their way through it, and they will do that by reading only the beginnings of things.</p>
<p>Make your information easy to find. Structure your argument in a tree, and make sure it supports random-access. Nobody is going to read the whole thing from start to finish. Instead they’re going to jump around, ignoring the pieces they already know, and looking for the bits they don’t.</p>
<p>Use lots of short paragraphs. A paragraph should correspond to a single idea.</p>
<p>Anticipate which parts of your argument will be difficult for your readers, and be proactive in trying to assuage those difficulties. Give lots of examples of what you’re talking about, and more importantly, what you’re not talking about.</p>
<p>Point out where you went into the weeds while learning this stuff. Steer readers away from common mistakes and misconceptions.</p>
<p>And finally, end on a high note. Leave people with a good feeling, and it will incentivize them to get to the bottom of your next piece. Inspirational calls to action are a good way to go out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell them what you’re going to tell them. Then tell them. Finally, tell them what you told them.</p>
<p>-Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny and poignant quotes are too.</p>

I always like pointing out this fact when I teach classes on gesture, because it gives us an an interesting perspective on how we learn and use gestures. Until now I’ve mostly cited <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnature%2Fjournal%2Fv396%2Fn6708%2Fabs%2F396228a0.html&amp;t=ZjI3ODlkYTk0MjZhMTQ3OTdkZTY3OWE3MjA1YzU0NTI2N2JmYTk3MixqY2RYbFZ2Qw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A0DQa0-vgmaHanljYXgHk5w&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlinguo.com%2Fpost%2F149950073272%2Fblind-people-gesture-and-why-thats-kind-of-a-big&amp;m=0" target="_blank">a 1998 paper from Jana Iverson and Susan Goldin-Meadow</a> that analysed the gestures and speech of young blind people. Not only do blind people gesture, but the frequency and types of gestures they use does not appear to differ greatly from how sighted people gesture. If people learn gesture without ever <i>seeing</i> a gesture (and, most likely, never being shown), then there must be something about learning a language that means you get gestures as a bonus.</p><p>Blind people will even gesture when talking to other blind people, and sighted people will gesture when speaking on the phone - so we know that people don’t <i>only </i>gesture when they speak to someone who can see their gestures. <br></p><p>Earlier this year a new paper came out that adds to this story. Şeyda Özçalışkan, Ché Lucero and Susan Goldin-Meadow looked at the gestures of blind speakers of Turkish and English, to see if the *way* they gestured was different to sighted speakers of those languages. Some of the sighted speakers were blindfolded and others left able to see their conversation partner. <br></p><p>Turkish and English were chosen, because it has already been established that speakers of those languages <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DExpressing%2Bmanner%2Band%2Bpath%2Bin%2BEnglish%2Band%2BTurkish%253A%2BDifferences%2Bin%2Bspeech%252C%2Bgesture%252C%2Band%2Bconceptualization.%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D&amp;t=N2I4ZTYyZmU0ZTFlOWY3NjMwYzliYjNiNjQ3MTQyZWJmNGJjZThhMCxqY2RYbFZ2Qw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A0DQa0-vgmaHanljYXgHk5w&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlinguo.com%2Fpost%2F149950073272%2Fblind-people-gesture-and-why-thats-kind-of-a-big&amp;m=0" target="_blank">consistently gesture differently</a> when talking about videos of items moving. English speakers will be more likely to show the manner (e.g. ‘rolling’ or bouncing’) and trajectory (e.g. ‘left to right’, ‘downwards’) together in one gesture, and Turkish speakers will show these features as two separate gestures. This reflects the fact that English ‘roll down’ is one verbal clause, while in Turkish the equivalent would be<i> yuvarlanarak iniyor</i>, which translates as two verbs ‘rolling descending’. <br></p><p>Since we know that blind people <i>do</i> gesture, Özçalışkan’s team wanted to figure out if they gestured like other speakers of their language. Did the blind Turkish speakers separate the manner and trajectory of their gestures like their verbs? Did English speakers combine them? Of course, the standard methodology of showing videos wouldn’t work with blind participants, so the researchers built three dimensional models of events for people to feel before they discussed them.<br></p><p>The results showed that blind Turkish speakers gesture like their sighted counterparts, and the same for English speakers. All Turkish speakers gestured significantly differently from all English speakers, regardless of sightedness. This means that these particular gestural patterns are something that’s deeply linked to the grammatical properties of a language, and not something that we learn from looking at other speakers. <br></p><p><b>References</b><br></p><p>Jana M.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), of which SHA-256 is a part, is one of the most popular <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hashing algorithms</a> out there. In this article, we are going to break down each step of the algorithm as simple as we can and work through a real-life example by hand.</p>



<p>SHA-2 is known for its security (it hasn’t <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://shattered.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken down like SHA-1</a>), and its speed. In cases where <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">keys are not being generated</a>, such as mining Bitcoin, a fast hash algorithm like SHA-2 often reigns supreme.</p>



<h2><span id="What_Is_a_Hash_Function">What Is a Hash Function?</span>
</h2>



<p>If you want to read more about hash functions in general, do so <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">here</a>. That said, in order to move forward let’s recap three of the main purposes of a hash function:</p>



<ul>
<li>To scramble data deterministically</li>
<li>To accept input of any length and output a fixed-length result</li>
<li>To irreversibly manipulate data. The input can’t be derived from the output</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="SHA-2_vs_SHA-256">SHA-2 vs SHA-256</span>
</h2>



<p>SHA-2 is an <em>algorithm</em>, a generalized idea of how to hash data. SHA-256 sets additional constants that define the SHA-2 algorithm’s behavior. One such constant is the output size. “256” and “512” refer to their respective output digest sizes in bits.</p>



<p>Let’s step through an example of SHA-256.</p>



<h2><span id="SHA-256_hello_world_Step_1_-_Pre-Processing">SHA-256 “hello world”; Step 1 – Pre-Processing</span>
</h2>



<ul><li>Convert “hello world” to binary:</li></ul>
<pre><code>01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01110111 01101111
01110010 01101100 01100100</code></pre>



<ul><li>Append a single 1:</li></ul>
<pre><code>01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01110111 01101111
01110010 01101100 01100100 1</code></pre>



<ul><li>Pad with 0’s until data is a multiple of 512, less 64 bits (448 bits in our case):</li></ul>

</code></pre>



<ul><li>Append 64 bits to the end, where the 64 bits are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> integer representing the length of the original input in binary. In our case, 88, or in binary, “1011000”.</li></ul>

<p>Now we have our input, which will always be evenly divisible by 512.</p>



<h2><span id="Step_2_-_Initialize_Hash_Values_h">Step 2 – Initialize Hash Values (h)</span>

<p>Now we create 8 hash values. These are hard-coded constants that represent the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19</p>

<h2><span id="Step_3_-_Initialize_Round_Constants_k">Step 3 – Initialize Round Constants (k)</span>

<p>Similar to step 2, we are creating some constants (<em>Learn more about constants and when to use them <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/10/14/constants-in-go-vs-javascript-and-when-to-use-them/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></em>).
