<p>Adapting your language to match that of your audience, in today's world, seems to be growing in importance by the day. Let's contrast two public figures in public appearances that took place yesterday: Fauci vs. Trump.</p>
<h2 id="dr-fauci-vs-populism">Dr Fauci vs Populism</h2>
<p>The rising wave of populism in the U.S has wrought a "distrust of experts". That's a real shame, especially when you don't listen to your infectious disease expert during a Pandemic.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 39.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2039.png"></p>
<p>Dr Fauci literally wrote the book on infectious disease, yet the populists are calling for his head. Why?</p>
<h3 id="they-dont-understand-a-word-he-says">They don't understand a word he says</h3>
<p>I was watching this <a href="https://web.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10112108870243761/">interview</a> of Dr Fauci by Zuck, yesterday. Finally Fauci is given a chance to speak to the people. Yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Citizenry"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>People?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"myalgic encephalitis"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeling too tired to lift an arm or get out of bed?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"deleterious consequences"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad things happen?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"i used the word 'comparable' and i think it may have been taken out of context"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Then don't say 'comparable'.</p>
<p>Indeed we already have evidence that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/09/2008868117">working memory predicts social-distancing compliance</a>. This is pretty damning evidence: essentially people with lower working memory capacity are unwilling to socially distance themselves as they cannot hold enough variables in mind to accurately assess the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Thus it isn't too much of a leap to theorise that a lower working memory capacity is also linked with a restricted vocabulary, and thus a reduced ability to process Dr Fauci's long, complex sentences which are laiden with technical jargon and advanced vocab.</p>
<p>Or to put it bluntly: the idiots don't understand Dr Fauci.</p>
<h2 id="donald-trump-is-a-communication-wizard">Donald Trump is a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Scott Adams accurately predicted <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/10/23/the-case-for-a-trump-landslide-part-1/">Donal Trump would win the elections in a landslide</a> back in 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trump is talking directly to peopleâ€™s subconscious. Everything else he says is just a carrier signal." --Scott Adams (<a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/09/06/how-to-spot-a-wizard/">how to spot a wizard</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example of Trump's communicative Wizardry. On the same Day Dr Fauci was telling the citizenry about myalgic encephalitis and deleterious consequences, Trump did this:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 40.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2040.png"></p>
<p>Trump had the audacity to set up two cranes, to visually demonstrate lifting regulatory weights off the Republican red truck, while regulation still weighing down on the Democrat blue truck. This is pure communication genius, <strong>because any idiot can understand it</strong> and it <strong>communicates to their subconscious</strong>.</p>
<p>By catering to the lowest common denominator, Trump ensures he captures 100% of his potential base. Not a single word is lost. In fact this kind of visual communication transcends language, education level, even culture.</p>
<h2 id="boris-johnson-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Boris Johnson is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>In this interview, Johnson shares his communication principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"What people listen to are short anglo-saxon words that readily correspond to some object in the universe that they can identify. So in other words: talk simply, in plain English, and talk about stuff in the real world." --Boris Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Deriding people like Trump or Johnson for their perceived linguistic blunders utterly misses the point. <strong>Their blunders are what makes them accessible.</strong> Their simple language is what makes them understable. Their communicative wizardly is what makes them irresistible to their base.</p>
<h2 id="elon-musk-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Elon Musk is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Those who know me will confirm this to you: i have been a huge Musky for a very long time. Elon Musk is yet another genius at tailoring his communication to his base:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 37.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2037.png"></p>
<p>Musk speaks to engineers, or generally a base with technological interests, so his language is not always as simple as it could be. But when you consider the topics he talks about, you have to admire how accessible he is able to make them. The language is simple, and the topics relate to the real world.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 41.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2041.png"></p>
<p>And then there are his masterpieces of communication, like the Tesla he sent into orbit. Once again, pure communication genius that transcends language and culture.</p>
<p>Or his EDM track:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOEWUm6aGPg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't doubt your vibe, because it's true." -- Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick glance at Tesla's stock performance since the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> will tell you the message was indeed recieved.</p>
<h2 id="idiocracy-had-it-right">Idiocracy had it right</h2>
<p>The movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/">Idiocracy (2006)</a> is a spooky and hilarious foray into a potential future dumbing down of the human race. The main character, from our time, <strong>who's name is "no sure"</strong> wakes up in the future as the <strong>man with the highest IQ. But nobody understands a word he says</strong>.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGUNPMPrxvA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>He narrowly manages to save the human race by <strong>showing them</strong> that watering crops with water instead of gatorade is the solution to all their problems.</p>

<p>All the evidence points to dumbing down your language, and communicating visually and symbolically to become an unstoppable communicator. <strong>Think like a scientist and talk like a populist; you will become unstoppable</strong>.</p>

<p>You know that feeling when someone is explaining an idea and you're struggling to make sense of it—like peering out into dense fog, hoping to glimpse the outline of an approaching ship? Maybe it's because they're using unfamiliar acronyms or taking leaps of logic, or maybe it's simply not something you have any personal experience with. The idea is obvious to them, but not to you.</p><p>In Richard Feynman's hilarious and incisive memoir, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393355624/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliotpeper-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0393355624&amp;linkId=759f61e594ab9f1df1971b41fa4ce33b" target="_blank">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a></i>, the Nobel Laureate shares his personal method for cutting straight to the heart of seemingly complex ideas, even when speaking to experts in fields far beyond physics: “I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I’m trying to understand: I keep making up examples.”&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever anything was vague or confusing, he would ask for a concrete example. Then, even as his interlocutor reverted to describing general theory, Feynman would follow the concrete example along in his mind—often noticing flaws or opportunities in the idea that weren't obvious in the abstract. Just as Theseus escaped the labyrinth by following Ariadne's string, so you can use real, physical examples to escape the labyrinth of abstract thought, and arrive at insight.</p><p>Writing fiction is often about reversing Feynman's scheme: making up compelling stories that provide concrete examples from which ideas can be derived, thereby illuminating them.</p><p>

<p>On July 15 2020, between 20:00 to 22:00 UTC, up to one hundred and thirty <strong>high-profile</strong> Twitter accounts were compromised.</p>



<p>Some affected accounts included Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, and Jeff Bezos, alongside cryptocurrency accounts like CoinBase and Binance. The majority of accounts had over one million followers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/36698-68549-200715-TwitterHack-xl.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Apple's tweet"><figcaption>Tweet from Apple’s official Twitter account</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since this is a developing situation, we don’t know anything for certain. With that in mind, here is a summary of what we think we know so far.</p>



<p>As you can see from the image above, the scam involved trusted accounts claiming to double the amount of any bitcoin sent to a certain address.</p>



<p>Many different bitcoin addresses were used, and one address reportedly gained the equivalent of over $110,000.</p>



<h2>how did this happen?</h2>



<p>It is difficult to believe that such a well-known platform could be breached in such a way that goes undetected until hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage have been caused. With such a popular social network, you’d think the security is unbeatable.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s try to break it down.</strong></p>



<p>On the day of the attack, <a href="http://vice.com/">Vice</a> was contacted by a group claiming to be responsible for the attack, who said they paid a Twitter employee to give them access to an administrative tool that allowed them to change account’s settings which would allow them to get around security practices such as Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for these accounts.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t necessarily a reliable source.</p>



<figure><img src="https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png 738w, https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-300x80.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px"><figcaption>Tweet from Twitter’s official support account</figcaption></figure>



<p>This tweet (above) from Twitter’s official support account suggests that a social engineering attack was used to gain access to “internal systems and tools” — similar to the “administrative tool” mentioned above.</p>



<p>Social engineering is when you trick a person (in this case a twitter employee) into compromising their own system. This can be through many methods. A common example of social engineering is telephone scammers, which are, for example, when someone calls you pretending to be your bank, asks for some sensitive details, claims to have fixed some made-up issue, and hangs up, leaving you clueless to the fact that they have just drained all the money from your account.</p>



<p>This technique or similar could have been used to gain access to Twitter’s systems through tricking staff into installing tools like a remote access tool (RAT) which would allow the hackers to gain access to admin tools and credentials without raising any alarms.</p>



<p>Now, this tool that the hackers had access to would allow them to edit account variables like the confirmation email address, the 2FA email address or phone number, and so on, allowing them to reset the password and gain full control over the account.</p>



<p>From there they sent out the tweets with the bitcoin scam. Each sculpted to fit the persona who tweeted them out, indicating a lot of time and thought put into this attack.</p>



<h2>something darker?</h2>



<p>I’ll leave you with something to ponder on:<br>Was money really the final motive of this attack?</p>



<p>Somebody with the ability to pull off such a sophisticated attack would surely be above a low-income bitcoin scam. <br>Personally, I think the scam is a mere cover-up for something much darker.</p>



<p>What’s your opinion? Leave a comment below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Here at Hologram, we use two main programming languages for our backend stack: PHP and Python. Our PHP component is the one that is the most visible to users since that is our entire REST API.</p><p>We do get some questions on why we use PHP in such a major role because the conventional wisdom is that PHP is outdated or clunky. My contention is that PHP suffers from this view because of two reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>People learned it back in 2005 when it was a younger language and was lacking a lot of really useful or common features like classes</li><li>In order to maintain compatibility, many popular applications *cough* Wordpress *cough* didn’t take advantage of a lot of the newer stuff and people had to keep hacking on old-fashioned PHP well past the time a lot of great new features were introduced.</li></ol><p>Because of this, I want to defend PHP as a really useful language and a great fit for our needs.</p><p>I think a lot of people already know that PHP has some good built-in web server features, like a global array for getting HTTP headers or built-in session cookie support, but they may not know about a lot of other features that make it a solid language overall.</p><p>Here are some of the great pieces of PHP:</p><h2>Classes!</h2><p>Yes, back in the day PHP didn’t have classes and things could get messy very quickly. I recall long lists of include calls to pull in all the functions you’d need and having to keep passing tons of arguments around to functions with really long names.<br></p><p>Well, have no fear; PHP has great object support these days. Classes, constructors, destructors, namespaces, inheritance, and all that good stuff.<br></p><p>But it goes beyond that into what is a great feature that is more unique to PHP:<br></p><h2>The Autoloader</h2><p>PHP has a useful feature where it can automatically load the file for a class if the class hasn’t been loaded already. This means no more blocks of include/require statements at the top of all your files. If you use a class then it gets loaded.<br></p><p>On its own, this is already really nice, but what makes this a game changer is that the specific autoloading logic can be totally customized in your application and multiple autoloaders can be chained together. This means that all of your third party libraries get autoloaded as well.</p><p>In your code, you just create your classes or call their methods and everything gets pulled in for you. No need to include anything manually or fight with include paths like in other languages. In the entire Hologram codebase outside of test code, we call <em>include()</em> or <em>require()</em> maybe twice.<br></p><p>But speaking of those third party libraries…<br></p><h2>Package Management</h2><p>PHP has package management systems to rival those of other languages. The one we use at Hologram is called Composer, which is the most popular one. It’s incredibly simple to use and stores all settings in JSON files. You can give it version ranges to use for each package and it’ll generate a lockfile that could be checked into the repo if you want to be extra careful about making sure everyone is using the exact same package revision.</p><p>To add a new package into the JSON file and install it, it’s as simple as</p><p><code>
    composer install somepackage
</code></p><h2>Frameworks</h2><p>PHP has a great developer community around it these days and so not only are there a ton of individual libraries to use, but full frameworks that can help make building an app much easier. At Hologram, we use the Slim Framework which has a very simple router for defining our API calls as well as other useful features, like an easy method for adding middleware which comes in handy for authentication and rate limiting code.<br></p><p>Other popular frameworks include Laravel and Symfony.</p><h2>PDO</h2><p>PHP has the best database integration of any language I’ve used and PDO is the cornerstone of that. PDO stands for PHP Database Objects and it is the preferred way to execute your SQL queries.<br></p><p>It includes all the usual functions for running queries and paging through the results. Rows can be returned as PHP associative arrays which means that all columns are properly labelled in the array itself.<br></p><p>The best part is that it supports parameterized queries and automatically sanitizes the inputs for you. This means that you can do something like this:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;");
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute([$idnumber]);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>PDO will automatically replace that “?” with the value in <em>$idnumber</em> and it will properly escape things to prevent SQL injection attacks for you.</p><p>You can also do cool things like named parameters:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $values = ['id' =&gt; 10, 'email' =&gt; 'someemail@hologram.io'];
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id AND email = :email;');
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute($values);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>In this case, PDO will replace the parameters properly from that array while still sanitizing them.<br></p><p>PDO also exposes all the same interfaces regardless of the underlying database engine. There are of course the occasional SQL differences between engines, but most of the time you simply specify the type of database when you initially connect and then make all the same function calls you would for anything else.<br></p><h2>Phinx</h2><p>Speaking of databases, I want to mention a fantastic third party library we use called Phinx to do all of our database migrations. Anytime we need to make a schema change, we define it entirely using PHP code that Phinx then runs on the database. Migrations look like this:<br></p><p><code>
    $orders = $this-&gt;table('orders');
    $orders-&gt;addColumn('invoice_text', 'string', ['length'=&gt;256, 'default'=&gt;''])
           -&gt;update();
</code></p><p>Check them out at <a href="https://phinx.org/" target="_blank">phinx.org</a></p><h2>Lots of useful built-in functions</h2><p>One final aspect that makes things easier and faster in PHP is all of the great built-in utility functions.<br></p><p>Let’s say you have a result set from a database which would be an array of row arrays. You want to pull the name column from each one. You could of course do this with a map function, which PHP supports as well, but why not do this the easy way:</p><p><code>
$names = array_column($rows, 'name');
</code></p><p>‍<em>‍</em>That’s it. And it’s very fast, as that would all be running in PHP’s C internals.<br></p><p>There are dozens more like that, for everything from doing more array operations to parsing XML to manipulating uploaded files and PHP has great documentation on all of them.<br></p><p>A few useful ones that we like:</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-chunk" target="_blank"><strong>array_chunk</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Break an array into smaller chunks of any size</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-unique.php" target="_blank"><strong>array_unique</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Remove all duplicate values from an array</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime" target="_blank"><strong>DateTime</strong></a> - A whole class for handling dates that can also parse plain English date descriptions like “midnight first day of next month”</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fpassthru" target="_blank"><strong>fpassthru</strong></a> - Reads a file and sends it right back out to the user</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-getcsv" target="_blank"><strong>str_getcsv</strong></a> - Part of built-in CSV parsing, this reads a CSV row from a string</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode" target="_blank"><strong>urlencode</strong></a> - URL encode a string</p><p>And don’t forget useful operators like <em>??</em> which allows you to check for index existence in an array while specifying a default value. </p><p><code>
$a = $some_array[$x] ?? 500;
</code></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><div><p>Consider PHP for your projects! It’s better than you think.</p></div><h3>Further Reading</h3><p>Modern PHP by Josh Lockhart (The author of the Slim Framework)</p><p><a href="https://phptherightway.com/">phptherightway.com</a> (Also by Josh Lockhart and Phil Sturgeon)</p></div></div></div>]]>

        Using custom code, the natural curvature of each tree is "corrected." Manufactured objects, i.e. buildings and power lines, twist and contort around the artificially plumbed tree. Each photo is shot on large format film, the only medium that captures enough detail to straighten the tree without pixelly artifacts. Presented as silver gelatin prints.

      <p>I had a very cool surprise today while checking my GitHub profile. Some projects I contributed to have been selected to included to be part of the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">Arctic Code Vault</a> project, and I am officially an <strong>Arctic Code Vault Contributor</strong>!</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"><img alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>That made me chuckle, and I now have a nice little badge under my contact info. </p>
<p>Though to be honest my contributions are really just simple corrections and fixes that I regularly do to projects I'm using or reading about. Not the majestic legacy some people would imagine when they hear of a project like this one! </p>
<p>But hey, people in 10k years will be able to blame me for a specific typo I made, isn't that great? 😁 (if they can figure out how to use git, which isn't something I would bet on).</p>

<section>
<div>
<p>This is a journey of obscure settings, red herrings, and poll vs. epoll. A story of how I had spent a couple days performance profiling and optimizing some Elixir code, only to discover that the true solution to the performance issues was an obscure setting in the Erlang VM that controlled which system call the IO polling subsystem used, and that my code-level optimizations were irrelevant. This particular setting has been made redundant by a rewrite of IO polling in a subsequent Erlang/OTP release, but still, it was a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, we <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/why-is-everyone-talking-about-mqtt/">released our MQTT protocol adapter</a>. Like our <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/being-protocol-agnostic-at-ably">Pusher and Pubnub adapters</a>, it was implemented as an Elixir service, which sits in front of our normal service frontend and live-translates to and from Ably's own protocol.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the release, we decided to do some load testing to figure out the CPU cost per instance of holding onto substantial numbers of mostly-idle MQTT connections (driven by a customer with a large number of IoT devices).</p>
<p>Initial results were not great.</p>
<p>With 15K idle MQTT connections, on one of our usual instances (an AWS m5.large), CPU usage was reaching 60%, mostly from the adapter (with the remainder from the normal Ably frontend process). So we started trying to figure out why that was.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of ways you can get performance data out of the BEAM (the Erlang VM). To start with there's the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/debugging.html#observer">observer</a>, which you can use to view all running processes (<a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html">Erlang processes</a>, not system processes), ordered by reductions (≈function calls, a proxy for CPU usage) or by memory usage. There are also various tracing facilities, which can trace all calls from particular processes, all calls to a given function from any process, and so on. (The built-in tools can be a little low-level, but there are various more user-friendly wrappers available).</p>
<p>I couldn't see anything obvious from just looking at the observer; no processes appeared to be using an excess of resources. What I really wanted was to trace the whole system, with all function calls, and then generate flame graphs out of that data, to get a sense of what was actually using up all that CPU. Doing that using traditional BEAM tracing of every function call would be very expensive; tracing adds too much overhead to do it for every function call ever. Luckily, Scott Fritchie has a great project called eflame2 <a href="https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame">https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame</a> (building off Vlad Ki's eflame <a href="https://github.com/proger/eflame">https://github.com/proger/eflame</a>), which makes some experimental changes to the BEAM to allow it to support time-sampled trace data: generating a stack trace every (say) 100ms, and using that to construct a flame graph.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/07/example-flamegraph.png"><figcaption>Example section of a flamegraph. The original is SVG, and you can click segments to zoom in on them. This is just a screenshot.</figcaption></figure><p>The results were a little puzzling. It showed the vast majority of time per the flamegraphs spent in SLEEP, even though observed CPU usage was still very high.</p>
<p>Experienced BEAMers may now be thinking "A-ha! I bet this is an sbwt issue!" The BEAM process scheduler by default, when it runs out of Erlang processes to schedule, spins for several milliseconds to stop the OS scheduler from scheduling a different OS process, to reduce latency if new work does need to be done. This is known as <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">scheduler busy wait</a>. This can be reasonable behavior if the BEAM is the only important process running on the box that it's running on — which is often the case. But in our case it isn't, it has to play nicely with our frontend processes, and others as well. This behavior often catches out people who try to benchmark Erlang/Elixir against other languages, making the BEAM appear to consume a lot of CPU, even when average latency is low. (I'm pretty sure this mistake is what led to the conclusion that "Elixir nearly saturated all 36 cores while delivering a surprisingly consistent performance" in <a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/">this blog post by Stressgrid</a>, for example). It can easily be disabled by passing <code>+sbwt none</code> ('t' = threshold) to the Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This was not the cause of my problem; I had already made that change.</p>
<p>So I shrugged, put aside for now the SLEEPs as a measurement artifact, and filtered them out of the trace output, generating some flamegraphs to see what the biggest consumers of CPU were out of all the non-idle samples.</p>
<p>One source was <code>:crypto.strong_random_bytes</code> when responding to websocket pings from our Ably frontends. The adapter connects to our frontends the same way our client libraries do: over websockets, one for each connection. </p>
<p>(Using websockets to connect two services running on the same box may seem an odd choice: the reasoning was that the translated connection would just appear and behave as a normal external websocket, the Ably frontend wouldn't have to do anything special or different for a connection via the MQTT adapter compared to a normal external websocket connection.) </p>
<p>The frontend sends a websocket ping to each client every 15 seconds, primarily as a way of detecting (and allowing the client to detect) whether the connection is genuinely still alive. When sending a message (even just a pong), a websocket feature called <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.3">masking</a> requires the client to generate a random "mask" — random bytes which are XOR'd with the payload. The point of this is to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-10.3">defeat cache poisoning attacks on proxies</a>. This is of course unnecessary for a websocket between two services running on the same instance. I disabled masking (using <a href="https://github.com/meh/elixir-socket">elixir-socket</a> this was as simple as passing <code>mask: nil</code> as an option to <code>Socket.Web.send</code>).</p>
<p>Another source of CPU usage was responding to MQTT pings from clients. The current code was responding to them in the same way it responded to all messages: decoding them into a <a href="https://github.com/suvash/hulaaki/">Hulaaki</a> Message , passing that to a main <code>MQTT.FromClient.handle()</code> function that pattern-matches on the message and sends a ping response:</p>
<pre><code>def handle(%Hulaaki.Message.PingReq{}, state) do
  Handler.send_to_client(Message.ping_response(), state)
  {:noreply, state}
end</code></pre>
<p>Not much, but do it a couple times a minute for tens of thousands of connections and it all adds up. Optimizing this was just a matter of adding a special-case to the ranch handler to recognise a ping and respond with a pong before the normal MQTT message-parsing logic is invoked. With Elixir's binary pattern matching this is very simple:</p>
<pre><code>@ping &lt;&lt;192,0&gt;&gt;
@pong &lt;&lt;208,0&gt;&gt;

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, @ping}, state) do
  @transport.send(socket, @pong)
  {:noreply, %{state | last_activity: now()}}
end

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, data}, state) do
  // handle all other packets</code></pre>
<p>(For most messages we have to handle messages spread over multiple TCP packets; for a two-byte message this is not an issue.)</p>
<p>I kept going, looking at the other (smaller but still prominent) CPU users from the flamegraphs. <code>URI.encode_query</code> was spending a fair amount of time in <code>URI.encode_www_form</code>; I replaced it with a custom query string encoder that didn't bother with that, since I knew I was already passing URI-safe strings. <code>Timex.Time.now()</code> / <code>elapsed()</code> (used to keep track of the last activity time on a connection) was showing quite a bit; I replaced it with <code>:erlang.system_time(:seconds)</code>. And so on.</p>
<p>And after all these in retrospect somewhat desperate micro-optimizations, &nbsp;I was... well, capturing flamegraphs that were now even more SLEEP dominated — having filed down everything else to the bare minimum —but system CPU was still much, much higher than it should have been.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Then, at some point I stumbled across <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2011-April/057472.html">a mailing list thread from 2011</a> about the <code>+K</code> flag (an argument to erlang runtime, like <code>+sbwt</code>). The <a href="http://www1.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">reference manual</a> states that it "Enables or disables the kernel poll functionality if the emulator supports it. Default is false (disabled)."</p>
<p>It turns out that with this disabled, the BEAM uses the <code>poll</code> system call to check for incoming IO events on Linux; with it enabled, it uses <code>epoll</code>. Julia Evans has a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/03/async-io-on-linux--select--poll--and-epoll/">great blog post on the difference between those</a>; the short version is that for listening to events on a large numbers of mostly-idle sockets, <code>epoll</code> is <em>dramatically</em> more efficient.</p>
<p>Enabling <code>+K true</code> was the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/magic-story.html">magic switch</a> I'd been looking for. With it on, BEAM CPU usage in the idle-MQTT load test dropped by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>So all the within-BEAM profiling and tracing, all my careful optimization of MQTT ping responses and so on were completely irrelevant, all a red herring. The BEAM was spending almost all of its CPU cycles on IO polling, only a tiny fraction actually executing bytecode, and I'd been spending all my time optimizing that small fraction.</p>
<p>One might question why that wasn't the default. There apparently exist usecases where <code>poll</code> may have an edge over <code>epoll</code> (extremely active sockets), but the general advice seems to be that the vast majority of people should use <code>epoll</code>. One person in that mailing list thread suggests that it's not the default because some OSes such as Windows don't have kernel poll support, but this doesn't make all that much sense — there's no reason to cripple platforms that do have epoll/kqueue/etc. for consistency with one that doesn't. (Especially since I doubt there are many people running the BEAM on Windows servers).</p>
<p>Happily, it seems that the Erlang/OTP team had been thinking along similar lines, and coincidentally, shortly after I discovered this, they announced that in OTP 21, the IO polling implementation <a href="http://blog.erlang.org/IO-Polling/">was being completely rewritten</a>. IO polling would be moved from scheduler threads to dedicated IO threads, and kernel-space polling (using epoll on Linux) would become the default (and in fact the <code>+K</code> switch would be removed entirely; epoll would be used always unless disabled at compile-time). Erlang/OTP 21 was duly released in June 2018, and this particular issue was solved at the source for everyone.</p>
<p>This was all two years ago. I left my micro-optimizations in: while marginal they did make some difference. I haven't had the chance to work on the adapter much recently; the problem with building services in …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Once it was held together by ad tech. But advertising spends keep going up, brand content is at peak saturation, and audiences are slowly but surely evacuating the big social media companies. Can the three forces —&nbsp;social media, content, and commerce&nbsp;—&nbsp;find a new way relate to each other?</p>

<p>Here enters the question of community.</p>

<p>As high quality content and effective brand strategy move down the long tail, “community” has become an important concept for every post-Web 2.0 player. Crypto token holders, influencer fanbases, DTC brand customers, creator audiences, and new social networks are all often referred to as communities, and each has a stake in developing community for itself.</p>

<p>A new business type here is the paid community: a direct subscription to join in. Today, most paid communities live on the outskirts of existing social platforms. But as they become normalized, paid communities are becoming a viable business model for smaller-scale social networks aiming to be both profitable and socially sustainable.</p>

<p>This emerging new media <em>thing</em>, the paid community social network, has new rules and new risks, and just as it will require new skillsets to operate, requires a new way of understanding what both business and community mean.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-paid-communities">The Emergence of Paid Communities</h2>

<p>In the last 5 years we’ve seen several interesting innovations as Web 2.0 business models recombined into new mixtures of content, social media, and commerce. Let’s take a look at each of these.</p>

<p>Content and commerce have been merging to create new publishing endeavors that make no distinction between advertising and editorial. These businesses take multiple forms: they include expensive brand-led lifestyle marketing initiatives like the WeTransfer blog and Casper’s Woolly Magazine; “native advertising” efforts like Vox’s <a href="http://theexplainerstudio.com/">Explainer Studio</a>, NYT’s&nbsp;affiliate marketing play with the Wirecutter acquisition; and the extension of lifestyle magazines into product, such as 032c’s streetwear line.</p>

<p>Content and social are also unifying, with Twitch streaming and YouTube being the biggest video players. Meanwhile paid newsletters have taken off in a big way in the last two years. In content + community, an audience connects around a specific content producer through some platform.</p>

<p>Finally, commerce and social are coming together, although to much less a degree than marketing teams who talk up “brand communities” would like you to think. In all but a few cases, “community” here is just the marketing language used to describe a microbrand’s niche Instagram fandom. To me “community” implies users regularly engaging with <em>each other</em>, a criterion which indicates that the “regular crowd” at neighborhood joints or local skate shops are much truer communities than most online brands. Nevertheless, brands are now much better at directly engaging current and future customers through social media. This merger is clearly happening.</p>

<p>Each pairing of verticals has produced some of the most interesting companies and media projects of the last few years. But what’s happening now is that all three are coming together in a new way, fusing to form a completely different type of business: <strong>paid communities.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="paid communities emerge from the combinatation of content, social media, and commerce businessess" src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/paidcommunities.png"></p>

<p>Paid communities are a still-nascent category, but the business model is familiar: free content with a subscription paywall for more (the standard model of content + social). Paid communities develop this formula further: they take the subject matter of a content producer or brand lifestyle, and pair it with a paywalled digital social space for ongoing user interaction. Here the community is not a passive audience, but one that generates its own discussion, and for users comprises much of the value in and of itself. This community often comes to re-shape the brand or content development process.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of burgeoning paid communities you might have already heard of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stratechery: paid content + members-only forum, for investors and tech strategists.</li>
  <li>Venkatesh Rao’s Art of Gig / Yak Collective: paid content + a Discord channel, for indie consultants.</li>
  <li>New Models: content aggregator + commissioned content + paid Discord channel (conducted through Patreon), for artists and cultural producers.</li>
  <li>It’s also worth mentioning that Substack is currently layering on commenting + social features for paid newsletters, so many successful Substacks qualify.</li>
</ul>

<p>These new paid communities largely live on invite-only Telegrams, Slacks, Discords, and Facebook groups, raising the question: could there be applications more suitable to these networks? Indeed, the growing popularity of paid communities has been noticed by a bunch of new venture-funded companies such as such as <a href="http://genevachat.com/">Genevachat</a>, <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty Networks</a>, and <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a>, all of which want to become “the platform for communities.”</p>

<p>Ironically, these “community platforms” are themselves largely clones of Slack and Discord. They have been designed to fit what <em>already</em> exists on the market —&nbsp;to generically scale to support every possible group&nbsp;—&nbsp;in order to drive the user numbers that can support venture-scale returns. With heavy competition and no differentiation, how could any one of these new platforms become successful? This paradox reveals the limits of venture capital logic. An alternative market analysis is needed to understand this emerging space.</p>

<p><img src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/communityplatforms.png" alt="generic looking community platforms"></p>

<p>Patreon is a good example of why generic community platforms are not the future. You could certainly say that Patreon is already at the center of content, social, and commerce. But of course, Patreon has for years been getting unbundled into A, B, and C type businesses. The reason for Patreon’s erosion is that its product design is totally unsuitable for all three use cases: it’s a bad brand platform, a bad content platform, and a bad social platform. Patreon is a classic case of what Venkatesh Rao calls “<a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/too-big-to-nail">Too Big to Nail</a>,” and businesses that try to follow in its stead will face similar challenges.</p>

<p>Don’t buy into the VC hype on this one. There will not be one tool to serve new internet-first communities.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, dozens of alternative social networks have sprouted up in the last couple years. With the maturation of Javascript-based web development and plenty of front-end talent, it’s become easy to build complex web applications with tiny teams. <a href="https://futureland.tv/">futureland.tv</a>, <a href="https://dialup.com/">Dialup</a>, <a href="https://special.fish/">Special Fish,</a> and alternative dating app <a href="https://www.bighead.app/">Bighead</a> are among these new experiments. These alternative social networks are interesting in part because they prove that dissatisfaction with mainstream web has motivated significant movement to alternatives. But they are also interesting because of their unique user communities.</p>

<p>New social networks have typically struggled to monetize due to their small audience sizes, as they are unable to achieve the scale to make meaningful revenue from advertising. Paid communities, however, supply an engaged and paying audience, providing an alternative route to sustainability for independent social networks. At the same time, social networks solve some of the deficiencies of paid content and brand communities. This is worth understanding well.</p>

<p>Businesses want to be active participants in their customers’ social landscape, because <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel/the-hyperfragmentation-of-retail-and-why-the-biggest-winners-are-digital-ad-platforms-not-5d55b26e96c">brand values are the last battleground for differentiation</a>. This is the very justification for community marketing, and the driving force behind the evolution of brand social media accounts from joke memes to increasingly woke and personal human voices. Offering a dedicated social space is a further extension of social participation. By providing a social space, brands can try to deepen their connection with users and have a place for content they produce to be discussed.</p>

<p>Similarly, the topic-specific functionality entertainers build into their streams can be seen as prototypes for rich social spaces. In journalistic media, content providers with growing audiences also need tools to manage their audience and moderate discussion. Slack’s 10,000 message limit for free accounts is a major obstruction to doing knowledge work in these spaces, and Discord’s free tier has lamentably small file upload size limits.</p>

<p>At this point, you may wonder: “why don’t users just want one place to manage all their communities?” Today’s existing tools will continue to be sufficient for some communities, and Discord and Slack’s robust bot APIs are capable of solving <em>some</em> community needs. But fundamentally, they are still based on chat, and chat simply isn’t the right core user experience for many other communities. Unique functionality and bespoke interfaces provide distinct advantages that off-the-shelf tooling can never achieve.</p>

<p>In order to understand how diverse and specialized these paid community / social networks can be, a few case studies, drawing from different scales, will be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Replit</strong><br>Replit is a community of young programmers, supported by a forum, a real-time collaborative IDE, and a library of openly forkable code projects. The deep integration between Replit’s social space and its programmer tooling enable efficient knowledge workflows and sharing of user-generated content. At the same time, it facilitates the growth of a highly collaborative culture <em>specific to this set of tools</em>. Replit has gone the venture capital route, monetizes through a premium offering including paid cloud storage and unlimited private projects.</p>

<div><p><strong>Are.na</strong><br>Are.na, founded in 2012, can claim to be one of the most successful indie social networks. (Disclosure: I am a shareholder through its Republic crowdfund.) Originally bootstrapped by a small community of NYC-based artists, it has grown to over <a href="https://www.are.na/roadmap">12,000 monthly active users</a>, largely designers, artists, researchers, and educators. For these users the restrained interface, absence of an algorithmic feed, and community of intellectuals and cultural producers have made it a popular tool. As of May 2020, Are.na took in a respectable $20,000 monthly …</p></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post will explain how you can easily create <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Lua/Dissectors">protocol dissectors</a>
in Wireshark, using the Lua programming language. This is can be useful when you’re working with
a custom protocol that Wireshark doesn’t already have a dissector for. If Wireshark looks like
this for example</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/before.png" alt="Wireshark without dissector"></p>

<p>it’s hard to tell what the various bytes in the data part represents.</p>

<p>Wireshark is written in C, and dissectors for Wireshark are generally also written in C. However,
Wireshark has a Lua implementation that makes it easy for people who are unfamiliar with C to write
dissectors. For those who are unfamiliar with Lua, it’s a very light-weight programming language
that is designed to be implemented as a scripting language in applications to extend their
functionality.</p>

<p>The downside of using Lua is that the dissector will be slower than a dissector written in C.</p>

<p>Before we start writing the dissector, let’s go through a crash course on Lua. It’s not important
to know the language in detail, but we must know the basics.</p>

<h3 id="lua-crash-course">Lua crash course</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lua is multi-paradigm, and supports procedural style, functional programming to some degree, and
it also has some object-oriented programming features. It doesn’t have classes, prototypes or
inheritance out of the box, but they can be made by the programmer.</li>
  <li>It’s dynamically typed.</li>
  <li>Scope is either <code>local</code> or <code>global</code>. It’s global if you don’t declare it.</li>
  <li>Semicolons are not needed. Whitespace is not important like in Python.</li>
  <li>Lines that start with <code>--</code> are comments.</li>
  <li>Don’t use <code>++</code> or <code>+=</code>. Use <code>i = i + 1</code> instead.</li>
  <li>Not equal in conditionals is <code>~=</code> rather than <code>!=</code>.</li>
  <li>Its types are: string, number, boolean, nil, function, userdata, thread and table. Number
represents all numbers, both floating points and integers. Booleans are either true or false.
Strings are either single-quote or double-quote. You can forget about thread and userdata.</li>
  <li>nil is a non-value. A variable will have the value nil before it’s assigned a proper value.</li>
  <li>In conditionals: nil and false are falsy, the rest are thruthy.</li>
  <li>Lua has a type called <code>table</code>, which is also the only data structure it has. Tables implements
associative arrays. Associative arrays can be indexed by both numbers and other types, such as
strings. They have no fixed size and elements can be added dynamically. Tables are often called
objects. They are created like this:</li>
</ul>



<p>Values are assigned like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>20</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>
<span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>"x"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>                    <span>-- same as a["x"] = 10</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>They can have functions and are generally very similar to objects in JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conditional branching looks like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>200</span>
<span>elseif</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>300</span>
<span>else</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>400</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Loops look like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is <em>i = first</em>, <em>last</em>, <em>delta</em>. <code>break</code> can be used, but continue cannot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functions are declared like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>arg1</span> <span>+</span> <span>arg2</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and are called like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>added_number</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see functions called like this:</p>



<p>then the functions <code>func1</code> and <code>func2</code> belongs to the table (object) <code>a</code>. Using colon is syntactic
sugar for passing the object itself as an argument to the function. That means <code>a:func1()</code> is
similar to <code>a.func1(a)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s the important stuff. You can read the <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/">Lua 5.3 Reference Manual</a>
if you care about the details.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>If you go to Help –&gt; About Wireshark –&gt; Folders, you’ll find all the folders Wireshark reads Lua
scripts from. Choose either the Personal Lua Plugins, Global Lua Plugins or Personal configuration
folder. E.g. <em>C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\2.4.2</em> on Windows. The script will be active when
Wireshark is started. You have to restart Wireshark after you do changes to the script, or reload
all the Lua scripts with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m using the latest version at the current date. What I’m doing here might not work on earlier
versions.</p>

<h3 id="the-protocol">The protocol</h3>

<p>The most interesting protocol to investigate in this post would probably be a custom one that
Wireshark doesn’t know of already, but all the custom protocols I’ve worked with have been work
related and I can’t post information about them here. So instead we’ll look at the
<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/">MongoDB wire protocol</a>.</p>

<p><em>(There is already a <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Mongo">Mongo dissector</a> in Wireshark, but I will not use that one.)</em></p>

<p>According to the specification linked to above, the MongoDB wire protocol is a TCP/IP protocol
using port number 27017. The byte ordering is little endian, meaning the least significant byte
comes first. Most protocols are big endian. The only difference is the ordering of the bytes. If
we had an int32 for example, with these bytes: <code>00 4F 23 11</code> in big endian, then the little endian
version would be <code>11 23 4F 00</code>. This is something must to take into account when writing the
dissector.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll only take a look at the header of the protocol. It looks like this</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/mongodb-wire-protocol-header.png" alt="MongoDB protocol header"></p>

<p>We can see that it has four int32s, each containing 4 bytes, because 4*8 = 32.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-boilerplate-code">Setting up the boilerplate code</h3>

<p>Let’s start by setting up some of the boilerplate code that’s needed in all dissectors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>dissector</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>pinfo</span><span>,</span> <span>tree</span><span>)</span>
  <span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

  <span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We start my creating a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_Proto">Proto</a> (protocol) object and call it <code>mongodb_protocol</code>. The
table constructor takes two arguments: <code>name</code> and <code>description</code>. The protocol requires a <code>fields</code>
table and a dissector function. We haven’t added any fields yet, so the <code>fields</code> table is empty. The
dissector function is called once for every packet of our type.</p>

<p>The dissector function has three parameters: <code>buffer</code>, <code>pinfo</code> and <code>tree</code>. <code>buffer</code> contains the
packet’s buffer and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_Tvb">Tvb object</a>. It contains the data we want to dissect. <code>pinfo</code>
contains the columns of the packet list and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Pinfo.html#lua_class_Pinfo">Pinfo object</a>. Finally, <code>tree</code> is
the tree root and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tree.html#lua_class_TreeItem">TreeItem object</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/columns.png" alt="Columns in packet list "></p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/tree.png" alt="Tree in packet details pane"></p>

<p>Inside the dissector function, we start by checking the length of the buffer and then returning if
it’s empty.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the <code>pinfo</code> object contains the columns in the packet list. We can use it to
set the protocol name when we receive a packet of MongoDB type. On the script’s first line we set
the name of the protocol to be “MongoDB” (by passing the name to the constructor). We set the
protocol column name here</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the protocol column name changes from TCP to MONGODB:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/protocol-column.png" alt="Packet list protocol column"></p>

<p>We must then create a sub tree in the tree structure found in the Packet Details pane. It done by
adding an additional tree item to the tree object that was passed as an argument to the dissector
function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The string is the name of the sub tree. Without having added any fields it will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/packet-pane-1.png" alt="Packet pane with MongoDB but without fields"></p>

<p>Finally, we must assign the protocol to a port. In my case, I’ll use port 59274, because that’s the
port I use to connect to the Mongo database.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>"udp.port"</code> can also be used, if the protocol uses UDP rather than TCP.</p>

<h3 id="adding-fields">Adding fields</h3>

<p>The script already runs at this stage, but it isn’t doing anything useful. For the script to do
something useful we have to add the fields that we want to parse. Fields are made by creating
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_ProtoField">ProtoField</a> objects. We can start off simple by adding only the first field.
The first field in the MongoDB wire protocol specification is the message length, which is an int32.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>dissector</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>pinfo</span><span>,</span> <span>tree</span><span>)</span>
  <span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add the following above the dissector function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument is used as a label in the filter settings, second is used as a label in the sub
tree and the last is used to decide how the variable’s value should be displayed. In this case I
want to show the value in decimal, but I could also use <code>base.HEX</code> to show it in hexadecimal format.
Hexadecimal format doesn’t work for int32 though.</p>

<p><code>ProtoField</code> has several types of functions we can use: <code>uint8()</code>, <code>uint16()</code>, <code>string()</code> and so on.
We have to use the one that matches the specification. A list of all the functions can be found
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_fn_ProtoField_char_abbr___name____base____valuestring____mask____desc__">here</a>.</p>

<p>We then add the field to the <code>fields</code> table of the protocol:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and finally add the field to the sub tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>subtree</span><span>:</span><span>add_le</span><span>(</span><span>message_length</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I use <code>add_le</code> rather than <code>add</code>, because we are working with a little-endian protocol. If the
protocol was big endian we would have to use <code>add</code>. The function takes two arguments: the field we
made further up, and a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_TvbRange">buffer range</a>. We can get a range of the buffer by using
the range function that is a part of the buffer object. <code>buffer(offset,length)</code> is the short form
for the range function. <code>buffer(0,4)</code> means we want to start at the first byte, and then take 4
bytes. The reason we want to start at 0 is because we’re dealing with the first field in the header.
We take 4 bytes because that is the size of an int32.</p>

<p>After reloading the Lua script with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong> Wireshark should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/messageLength-added.png" alt="Message length added to sub tree"></p>

<p>We can see that it parses the messageLength correctly. We can also see that we don’t …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id=""><p><em>This post is contributed by Sebastian Pop, Senior Software Engineer, Amazon Web Services.</em></p><p>AWS recently launched the Amazon EC2 M6g instances powered by Graviton2. Compared to similar-sized M5 instances, Graviton2 instances provide up to 40% better cost-performance on several open-source application stacks.</p><p>This blog discusses how AWS worked together with the PHP community to drive major improvements to the performance of the PHP software stack on the Graviton2-based instances. By using M6g instances, the latest release of PHP-7.4 currently experiences up to 37% faster execution time compared to the previous release PHP-7.3. This significantly lowers the cost of running PHP software such as WordPress on Amazon EC2 M6g instances.</p><h3>A better Zend optimizer for Arm64</h3><p>Zend optimizer is a component of the PHP runtime system that improves performance by up to 30% on a range of Zend micro-benchmarks. Before PHP 7.4 the Zend optimizer was not enabled for Arm. AWS added Arm64-specific implementations to several functions of the PHP interpreter.<br>AWS evaluated the performance impact of the software changes to the PHP interpreter by running the standard micro-benchmarks distributed with the Zend optimizer: bench.php and micro_bench.php. To look at the performance of PHP interpreter as used in a fully loaded server, the benchmarks are set to run as many copies in parallel as vCPUs in the system, that is, each vCPU runs one copy of the benchmark such that the utilization of the system is above 95%. The experiment was run on a 16 vCPUs Graviton2 M6g.4xl and a 16 vCPUs Intel M5.4xl instances. Between PHP versions 7.3 and 7.4 the execution time of M6g instances improved by up to 37%. The following images demonstrate the benchmark results: the first image shows improved execution time of Zend/bench.php with newer versions of PHP, and the second image illustrates a faster execution time with newer versions of PHP on Zend/micro_bench.php.</p><p><img src="https://idk.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Improving-performance-of-PHP-for-Arm64-and-impact-on-Amazon.png" alt="PHP performance with Graviton2" width="1027" height="300" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://idk.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Improving-performance-of-PHP-for-Arm64-and-impact-on-Amazon.png"></p><h3>Performance evaluation of WordPress on Ubuntu 19.04</h3><p>While the synthetic benchmarks proved M6g’s superior performance, I also looked at WordPress, a PHP-based real-world application. The following image shows the setup of the experiment:</p><p><img src="https://idk.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594781652_527_Improving-performance-of-PHP-for-Arm64-and-impact-on-Amazon.png" alt="PHP WordPress" width="497" height="145" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://idk.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594781652_527_Improving-performance-of-PHP-for-Arm64-and-impact-on-Amazon.png"></p><p>The machine represented in the middle of the image is the system under test (SUT) that is an M6g.4xl and an M5.4xl. To measure the performance of PHP independently of other components in the system, the MySQL database is set to run on a separate C5.4xl instance, in blue on the figure. The program WRK generates the HTTP requests for the main page of WordPress. WRK runs on a separate C5.4xl instance represented in orange on the figure. To minimize network noise, the three machines are allocated in the same cluster placement group. The SUT runs the NGINX web-server and the PHP interpreter. The NGINX web-server is configured with the fast CGI interface PHP-FPM. All the machines run Ubuntu 19.04.</p><p>With the software changes in PHP-7.4 and PHP-8, WordPress can serve up to 17% more pages per second on M6g.4xl vs. M5.4xl. Combined with the 20% lower cost of M6g instances, running PHP-7.4 and WordPress provides up to 34% better price/performance on M6g instances vs. M5 instances. The following image illustrates the performance of PHP versions 7.3, 7.4, and 8 when running on M6g.4xl and M5.4xl instances:</p><p><img src="https://idk.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594781652_522_Improving-performance-of-PHP-for-Arm64-and-impact-on-Amazon.png" alt="Wordpress NGINX performance" width="483" height="253" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://idk.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594781652_522_Improving-performance-of-PHP-for-Arm64-and-impact-on-Amazon.png"></p><p>Looking at the scalability of WordPress-NGINX benchmark on the M6g instances, and a better performing PHP-7.4 release, adding more vCPUs scales almost linearly in the number of served pages until eight vCPUs. However, on the beta version of PHP-8 from August 20, 2019 that contains even more optimizations, the scalability trend continues up to 32 vCPUs (after which CPU utilization drops below 90%.)<br>On the low-cost end of the spectrum, AWS offers an M6g.medium instance with 1vCPU that can sustain up to 77 pages per second which may be interesting for small (cost-conscious) users of WordPress.</p><p><img src="https://idk.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594781652_655_Improving-performance-of-PHP-for-Arm64-and-impact-on-Amazon.png" alt="Scalability of WordPress NGINX" width="497" height="453" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://idk.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594781652_655_Improving-performance-of-PHP-for-Arm64-and-impact-on-Amazon.png"></p><h3>How to install PHP-7.4</h3><p>Installation instructions: https://www.php.net/install<br>Installation instructions for Ubuntu: https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-php-on-ubuntu/</p><h3>AWS contributions to PHP-7.4</h3><h3>Patches impacting performance of WordPress benchmark</h3><p>The 20% performance difference from PHP-7.4 and PHP-8 master is due to https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/682b54f68748715f85e9ac4a267477d9ac61918a that removes support for PHP-4 constructors deprecated in PHP-7.0 https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_php4_constructors.<br>As this has been committed early after the PHP-7.4 branch has been cut, the patch may be easily applied to the PHP-7.4 branch to get the performance benefits that we see in PHP-8 master.<br>There are two other patches that impact the performance of the WordPress-NGINX benchmark, and both have been applied to master and PHP-7.4 branch:</p><h3>Future developments</h3><p>PHP-8 plans to release in 2021 with more improvements for Arm64: an improved toupper/tolower function brings performance up by 16.5x. https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4439</p><p>AWS has contributed changes to PCRE2 release 10.34. PCRE2 version 10.34 is used in PHP-8 to match regular expressions. PCRE2 accounted for about 8% of execution time in WordPress benchmark. The change contributed by AWS to PCRE2 vectorizes first character match and matching pairs of characters with NEON instructions: performance improves by up to 8x on M6g. https://lists.exim.org/lurker/message/20191106.052444.1ea1a176.en.html</p><p>PHP-8 plans to feature a new JIT compiler that optimizes the PHP byte-code in the Opcache. The JIT is currently developed on x86 and is based on Lua’s JIT. As Lua’s JIT supports ARM64, we work with PHP developers to enable and to tune the Opcache JIT in PHP-8 to get the best performance on AWS Graviton processors.</p><p>The interaction with PHP community was through early discussion with the maintainers of the PHP Zend optimizer on our plans to improve performance on ARM, patch reviews that improved the quality of our submissions, and follow-up patches from the community to address problems uncovered during review of our patches. AWS continues to contribute ARM performance improvements to PHP-8. We followed the same pattern of involvement with the PCRE community, and continue to work with other open-source communities to bring our expertise and knowledge in improving the performance and tuning of ARM-based AWS Graviton systems.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>PHP release 7.4 is key to obtain maximum performance from the Graviton2-based M6g instances. PHP 7.4 makes the M6g instances even more appealing by delivering both higher performance and lower cost compared to M5 instances.</p><p>To get started, check out the New – EC2 M6g Instances, powered by AWS Graviton2, and please leave comments!</p></div></div>]]>

The player returns.</p><p><em>Ad infinitum.</em> Until either the player or opponent breaks the loop, because they failed to return the ball.</p><p>Tennis folks call this a rally, but for us, this repeating structure is the game's core loop. It's exactly what we were looking for.</p><p>A core loop is the game's <em>essential activity</em>. Every sport has one, and every game has one:</p><ul><li>Baseball: a pitcher pitches a ball; a batter hits the ball, or misses.</li><li>Football: a quarterback receives the ball, and makes a play.</li></ul><p>Games have larger loops of course! In baseball, runners run to bases around a diamond. There are innings. There are game series.</p><p>But we seek the smallest, tightest loop of the game. Such that if you take this loop away, the game won't work.</p><p>Can you find a game that <em>doesn't</em> have a core loop? Heck, one can argue that visual novels –&nbsp;which are heavily story-based –&nbsp;have a core loop of dialogue navigation.</p><p>Since <a href="https://teamavocado.co/sports-game">we're making a boxing game</a>, let's identify the core loop:</p><ol><li>A boxer throws a punch.</li><li>An opponent evades or blocks the punch, or throws a punch back.</li></ol><p>From that core idea, we can scope our project.</p><h2 id="define-project-milestones">2. Define project milestones</h2><p>When game developers say to build on a strong core, they refer to core loops.</p><p>Wanna know why?</p><p>Once you've identified your game's core loop, the path forward is clear:</p><ol><li>🧭 <s><strong>The Goal.</strong> Do you want to tell a story? Express a feeling? Fulfill a game jam prompt? Make a game for a certain demographic?</s></li><li>🍏 <s><strong>The Core Loop.</strong> What's the essential activity that defines your game?</s></li><li>👩 <strong>The First Playable.</strong> Get stuff moving on screen ASAP. Code up your core loop so that your mom can play it.</li><li>🥞 <strong>The Horizontal Slice.</strong> Full gameplay. All game mechanics finalized, including progression and leveling mechanics.</li><li>🍰 <strong>The Vertical Slice.</strong> Full user experience with all game states. Includes menus, and win-lose conditions.</li><li>💅 <strong>Polish.</strong> Juice up your feedback. Add more content.</li><li>🎂 <strong>The Full Cake.</strong> The final game.</li></ol><p>Oh, and if you're using PICO-8, you might need to optimize tokens in between steps. 😛</p><p>These milestones will guide us through the rest of the tutorial series, so keep it in mind!</p><h2 id="design-your-game-loops-length">3. Design your game loop's length</h2><p>I think a <strong>good</strong> game is one where the total player time far exceeds the development time.</p><p>Why? Because players can replay your game over and over if it's genuinely fun. On the other hand, you only had to make the game once.</p><p>You get a lot more bang for your buck.</p><p>Part of that comes from the length of the higher-level game loop.</p><p>If you recall Pico Tennis, the <em>essential activity</em> is hitting the ball back and forth. But the higher-level <em>game</em> loop is the <em>rally</em>.</p><p>And in Pico Tennis, a rally lasts maybe a minute. This is important!</p><p>If you're designing for busy people who play games in pockets of time, maybe you want minute-long game loops. So players can play several rounds within the span of a coffee break.</p><p>(An interesting take: Jan Willem Nijman's <em>Minit</em> has game length in its name. Its game loop lasts exactly 60 seconds.)</p><blockquote><p><em>"Man, that's deep. Can I get some dog treats now?"</em></p><p><em>– Paraphrasing my dog, as she stares intently into my soul.</em></p></blockquote><p>Once you understand the idea of a core loop, you start to see them everywhere.</p><p>Take the game of life.</p><p>Not Conway's Game of Life! But actual day-to-day life.</p><p>The core loop of life is a <em>day</em>. And within those iterations lies a life <em>story</em>.</p><p>(From now on, maybe you'll think twice before creating a recurring event in Google Calendar.)</p><p>That's what we're aiming for. With a game's core loop, we tell a story.</p><p>What story do you want to tell?</p><p>In the next blog post, we'll discuss how to go from core loop to <a href="#define-project-milestones">First Playable</a>.</p><hr><h2>🏃‍♀️ Exercise</h2><p>Try it!</p><p>Head over to the PICO-8 BBS.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PostgreSQL backups can be categorized into two types: <em>logical</em> and <em>physical</em>. This post briefly covers each type and discusses the situations where you would use either one.</p><p>We'll cover some of the many tools you can use for Postgres backups in future posts.</p><h2>Logical Backups</h2><p>This form of backup is typically achieved by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html">translating all the data into a set of SQL commands and writing it into a single file</a>. This can then be fed to any database cluster to recreate everything. In your CLI, performing logical backups can be as easy as:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dump db_name </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for a single database, and:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dumpall </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for an entire database cluster. Both the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-dumpall.html">pg_dumpall</a> utilities have their respective additional options for you to choose from and set up your desired logical backup setting. Recovering from them is comparably as simple:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>psql -d db_name -f file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>Simpler and quicker way of performing backups</h4><p>As shown above, a single command is enough to perform a logical backup and another to recover from it. As a novice with databases, this would be an ideal and non-intimidating ensure that your database is backed up at all times.</p><h4>Migration between different major versions of Postgres</h4><p>If you are planning to migrate to a different major version of Postgres (for example, from Postgres 11 to Postgres 12), logical backups via <code>pg_dumpall</code> would surely be your <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">tool of choice</a>. This is mainly because internal data storage formats may differ between major versions. This is the basis of physical backups, eliminating it as an option when upgrading. We'll go deeper into migrations and how to perform them in another post.</p><h4>Backing up a single specific database</h4><p>With <code>pg_dump</code>, you can constantly back up a single, targeted database.</p><h2>Physical Backups</h2><p>Physical backups pertain to the actual set of files or file systems where your database data is stored. One option for physical backups involves <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-file.html">taking a snapshot</a> of your data files by making a copy of them.</p><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>More ideal for larger databases</h4><p>As your database grows to the size of a few gigabytes, backing it up through physical backups is more ideal than through logical backups. As explained <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#the-performance-impact-of-logical-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, over time, performing logical backups in large databases could lead to degraded performance for other queries. Given the long run time as well to successfully perform a logical backup on a large database, errors have a higher chance of occurring, making the eventual backup unusable.</p><h4>Achieving Point in Time Recovery</h4><p>Postgres also generates <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">Write Ahead Log</a> (WAL) files, which can be used together with a backed-up file system to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html">recover a database up to any chosen point in time</a>. When disaster strikes, this is one of the best options for recreating your database up to the point right before the unfortunate happens. This greatly minimizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</a> along the way. Even better, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL-G</a> are readily available to simplify the steps involved in setting this up.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, logical and physical backups are generated differently from one another. Neither has an advantage over the other. Depending on your needs, each brings unique uses to the table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Logical</th><th>Physical</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simpler way of getting started with backups.</td><td>Better way of handling backups for larger database clusters.</td></tr><tr><td>Using it to migrate between different major versions of Postgres.</td><td>Using it for Point in Time Recovery.</td></tr><tr><td>Having the option to back up a single database.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></section></div>]]>

                <p>I learned how to build websites the old fashioned way: looking at website source code and trying to replicate the things I saw. I threw in the odd book for the stuff I couldn’t <em>see</em> (like PHP/MySQL), and I was on my way.</p>

<p>This was back in 1999, when we’d write things like <code>&lt;font size="4" color="#000000"&gt;</code> and DHTML was a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>When CSS came along my approach to learning didn’t differ. But I <em>really</em> wish I’d taken the time to learn CSS properly: there was so much fundamental stuff I missed.</p>

<p>Here are some things I didn’t know that I wish I’d learned earlier.</p>

            </section>

                <p>Even though I <em>knew</em> about these properties, I didn’t fully understand them for a long time.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>block</code> elements expand horizontally to take up a whole line (like a heading). We can apply vertical margin to these.</li>
<li><code>inline</code> elements expand horizontally just enough to contain their content (like <code>strong</code> or <code>em</code> elements). We <strong>cannot apply vertical margins to these</strong> and they should usually be placed inside a <code>block</code> element.</li>
<li><code>inline-block</code> elements are like <code>inline</code> elements, <strong>but you can apply vertical margins to these</strong> (making them useful for things like buttons).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, <code>block</code> elements have a blue border, <code>inline</code> elements have an orange background, and our <code>inline-block</code> element has a red border.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>Images <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Styling_with_CSS">being inline by default</a> isn’t a problem, but it can cause confusion when trying to position them or add vertical margins.</p>

<p>If your CSS reset doesn’t include this already, I’d suggest adding the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>img {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will make their behaviour much more predictable. You might also want to add <code>max-width: 100%;</code> to stop them breaking out of their container, too.</p>

<h2 id="how-height-and-width-are-calculated">How height and width are calculated</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>By default, the width/height of a box is calculated by adding together the dimensions of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content area</li>
<li>Padding area</li>
<li>Border area</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t usually a problem for an element’s height: we’re usually not too bothered about how content reflows vertically. The problems usually occur when trying to calculate an element’s width, especially if there’s more than one element in a row.</p>

<p>If we had the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.some-class {
    width: 50%;
    padding: 2em;
    border: 0.1rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The total calculated <code>width</code> for <code>.some-class</code> would be:</p>

<p><code>50% + 4em + 0.2rem</code></p>

<p>That’s because of a property called <code>box-sizing</code> which has a default value of <code>content-box</code>. This value means the <code>width</code> property <strong>applies to the content area</strong>: everything else is added on top of this.</p>

<p>We can change this for all elements with the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Returning to our example, the element’s width would now apply to the <code>border</code>, so our element’s total <code>width</code> would be <code>50%</code>.</p>

<p>What happens to the <code>border</code> and <code>padding</code>? Those properties/values still apply, but they don’t affect the total <code>width</code> of the element: they sit within the defined area.</p>

<p>Check out this Codepen to see this in action:</p>

                    <p>We haven’t discussed <code>margin</code> here because <strong>margin is the space between elements</strong>. For that reason, it is never part of this calculation.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>If an element has no <code>background</code> or <code>border</code>, it can appear that <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> are the same. They are not!</p>

<ul>
<li><code>margin</code> is the space <strong>between</strong> elements</li>
<li><code>padding</code> is space <strong>inside</strong> an element</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes <code>padding</code> useful for elements that have a <code>background</code>. We often don’t want the content to be close to the edge of the element’s box and <code>padding</code> helps us achieve that.</p>

                <p>This has been the source of frustration for CSS newcomers for a long time. Rachel Andrew <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/#margin-collapsing">describes the behaviour</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When margins collapse, they will combine so that the space between the two elements becomes the larger of the two margins. The smaller margin essentially ending up inside the larger one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we have two block elements with <code>margin-bottom: 1em</code> on one element and <code>margin-top: 1.5em</code> on the element directly below it, the total space between the two elements would be <code>1.5em</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that here:</p>

                <p>When two margins meet, the larger margin absorbs the smaller margin. If the margins are the same value, they absorb each other.</p>

<p>As soon as we know this, <code>margin</code> calculations become easier. It might also change our approach to managing them, and that’s where something like <a href="https://cssfordesigners.com/articles/managing-vertical-margins-in-css">the Lobotomised Owl selector can be useful</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Margins don’t collapse when the parent element is set to <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code>.</p>

                <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It’s no surprise therefore that the <strong>cascade</strong> is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.</p>

<p>Though we might be aware of how our own stylesheets interact with each other, we have to remember that there’s <strong>always a default browser stylesheet</strong>. This is loaded <em>before</em> any custom stylesheets, making it easy to redeclare existing values.</p>

<p>The declared styles vary by browser, but they’re the reason that, by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headings have different sizes</li>
<li>Text is black</li>
<li>Lists have bullet points</li>
<li>Elements have any <code>display</code> property (such as <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And many other things.</p>

<p>Even if a website only has a single stylesheet, that stylesheet will always be merged with the browser’s default styles.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>Using pixels (<code>px</code>) is tempting because they’re simple to understand: declare <code>font-size: 24px</code> and the text will be <code>24px</code>. But that won’t provide a great user experience, particularly for users who resize content at <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html#Update02">the browser level</a> or zoom into content.</p>

<p>I started using <code>em</code> (and later <code>rem</code>) for font sizing early. It took much longer to feel comfortable using <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> for other things such as <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>border</code>.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is critical to making relative units manageable. For instance, we might use <code>em</code> for <code>@media</code> queries and vertical margins, but <code>rem</code> for consistent <code>border-width</code>.</p>

<p>The benefits of going all-in on relative sizing are well-worth the small adjustment in thinking that requires.</p>

Me and Joanne in front of one of our four homemade Grommet backdrops that were featured in all of our early videos.</p></div>
<p>Late last month, my Grommet co-founder Joanne Domeniconi and I were fired. Our majority shareholder Ace Hardware made the call, as is their right. It happens when visions for a company diverge.</p>
<p>Joanne and I are sad to abandon our Citizen Commerce™ mission and not see Grommet through to becoming a household name. But we feel nothing but a great deal of pride when we reflect on the hundreds of careers we shaped, the more than 3,000 small businesses we accelerated, and the thousands of jobs we created. We grew to a meaningful scale: where we could legitimately move markets and create demand for previously unheard-of products and even create new product categories. No one had heard of brands like SodaStream, Fitbit, OtterBox, PopSockets, S’well, Bombas, SimpliSafe and Mrs. Meyers when we embraced and launched them.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news one Grommet maker wrote, “<em>I have said it so many times it must sound like a broken record, but what you created was pure magic</em>!”&nbsp; For a small business with an innovative product, breaking through in a crowded consumer world is excruciatingly difficult. Each Grommet we launched benefited handsomely from our reputation, credibility, and gaining access to our 4M followers.&nbsp; I always saw being chosen as a Grommet as cutting two years of struggle out of their path. Many awesome companies would have died on the vine if it were not for Grommet.</p>

<p>We employed hundreds of the best and brightest.&nbsp; One of the current team members said, “<em>The Grommet has made an impression on me in many ways in the three years since I joined. I’ve worked for a number of small companies now, and while most of their founders have had “hustle” to spare, I have not encountered&nbsp;anyone else with your commitment to&nbsp;values.&nbsp;I did not choose a career path which automatically involves helping others (doctor, nonprofit, etc.), so it has been a comfort to work for someone who steers the ship with moral conviction</em>.”</p>

<p>Lynda Applegate, a Harvard Business School professor, wrote a popular case on The Grommet. Out of the thousands of potential case study subjects at her disposal she chose Grommet because she said we were the kind of business that could uniquely thrive in a <strong>modern</strong> economy—with a groundbreaking approach to creating value for multiple parties. Here’s a small slice of what that means to me: I believe that each person in a company is sacred and capable of leadership. When individuals are <strong>truly</strong> engaged toward a common purpose, powerful gains can be delivered for customers, suppliers, society, and the planet. It is then that a great business–measured in revenue and profits–can also be a great company.&nbsp; I was not interested in one without the other. This is what Lynda recognized.</p>
<p>I also hope our Grommet alums will be brave on the innovation front. As one of our investors John Landry told me, “If you aren’t the lead dog you are just sniffing someone else’s butt.”&nbsp; We originated the use of video in e-commerce. We were the first company to assign societal/personal values to the products we sold. While corporations today are scrambling to show they “care” about products from minority or queer or veteran entrepreneurs, or from social enterprises, or about American made sourcing—moves that I wholeheartedly applaud—I take pride that we sourced all of our products according to those kind of values from Day One.</p>

<p>It seems so basic, but we built a company whose people and products you could trust implicitly. If retail were not a catastrophic race to the bottom, “trustworthiness” would not be a distinctive competitive asset–but it was at The Grommet. And it was measurable. While most e-commerce companies find that dissatisfied customers return 15-25% of what is bought, our customers only returned 3% of Grommets. And these are products from totally unknown small businesses. 3%!! This is because we curated carefully and only launched products worth buying, from people worth supporting.</p>

<p>As a CEO, I am proud that we defied the odds and built a large-scale business, and shepherded it successfully through two financial crises and a global pandemic. We also defied the odds in attracting visionary angel investors like Peter Lynch and Jill Preotle–in a world where women founders get 2.7% of the funding from venture capitalists.&nbsp; We navigated not just one, but two, strategic investors over seven years.&nbsp; A public company CFO friend told me after the first investment (from the wonderful Rakuten) “<em>I have bought many companies. It never works for the founders. You won’t last six months.</em>” Ha!&nbsp; Joanne and I are not quitters. And we not only defied the odds in scaling the business, but also remained friends and partners throughout. We came into the venture together and there is poetry in the fact that we left Grommet the same way. Joanne and I were always a package deal.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of sappy, but I will think back at Grommet under our leadership as a form of “Camelot” for our team, our Makers and ourselves. My greatest hope is that Grommet alums will go on to use the lessons of how a business can both do good and do well. I know Grommet team members will be contributory to–and demanding of–their future employers when it comes to both ethical and executional standards. We all certainly learned a valuable lesson that one cannot simultaneously grow and harvest the same company–you have to pick a lane.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: for some reason beyond my understanding, our amazing VP of Operations Jason McCarthy was also terminated. The company was on a fantastic 2020 trajectory with revenues up 50% over plan in May and 25% for the year. Jason was very, very central to that success—our business was extremely operationally intense. Jason is a dynamic leader whose teams will follow him anywhere. &nbsp;He was my go-to person for many things from brainstorming new initiatives to putting models and plans to an analytical or real-world test.&nbsp; At Grommet he had the broadest portfolio of responsibilities among all my reports, including Logistics, Inventory Planning, Account Management, Growth Services and Customer Support. &nbsp;He also founded and built our Wholesale business. &nbsp;Beyond all that he is a culture builder who earned deep respect and loyalty during his seven year+ tenure at Grommet, including mine of course. I will be very happy to introduce him to worthy employers and startup teams.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the day (and our run), while the future course of Grommet will not include its founders’ drive and hustle, or our moral and spiritual guidance, we are happy to have shown the way for individuals and companies to support small businesses, to celebrate&nbsp; the work of underrepresented entrepreneurs, to seek out quality products, and to honor trustworthy people.&nbsp; Grommet was the culmination of my life’s work—and Joanne’s. We share a deep satisfaction and priceless legacy with the many talented and committed individuals who made it all happen.&nbsp; I have no regrets. This is the simplest definition of success that I know.</p>

July 16, 2020 | https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
        css-media-vars adds several --custom-css-variables, all namespaced with "--media-" and based on media queries, onto the HTML tag. These vars act as universal mixins for your CSS values. If the media query is true, your value will be used. If it's false, the var(..., fallback) will be used.</p><p>
        
        For example, there are several named breakpoints that respond to the width of the screen, such as <code>--media-lte-sm</code>.</p><p>
        
        In your CSS, if you want a value to only apply when the screen is less than or equal to the "small" breakpoint range, you mix it into your value:<br>
        <code>--my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;</code><br>
        From this point, you can use your variable anywhere and it will only be "2px" if the media query is true. Else, it uses the fallback you provide, like so:<br>
        <code>border: var(--my-small-value, 15px) solid green;</code><br>
        <img src="https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/suchborder.gif" alt="Border changing size at 900px breakpoint"><br>
        Here's a link to the jsbin pictured in the gif: <a href="https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output">https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output</a></p><p>
        
        If you need multiple break points, all you have to do is mix a different breakpoint into another variable and use it in the first fallback:<br>
        <code>
          --my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;<br>
          --my-medium-value: var(--media-md) 15px;<br>
          border: var(--my-small-value, var(--my-medium-value, 30px)) solid green;<br>
        </code><br>
        In this case, because the small values are listed first, this approach is <b>mobile-first</b>! CSS Variables don't compile the fallback unless it's used (similar to the expected short-circuting of conditionals in JavaScript).</p><p>
        
        This is all vanilla CSS. No JS or build step is necessary.<br>
        The library is small and built on a CSS trick called "Space Toggle" discovered in the development of <a href="http://augmented-ui.com/">augmented-ui</a>. You can read more about Space Toggle in these tweets which contain links to JSBins you can explore further with:<br>

        Browser support for CSS Variables is currently 94% globally according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">caniuse</a>.<br>
        Each of the --media-* vars are using the actual media query in CSS to switch them to the "true" state. Browser support depends on the feature but will always behave as if it's "false" if the media query isn't supported in the user's browser, such as <code>--media-prefers-light</code> which only recently gained traction.
