<h4 id="a-primer-on-the-cruel-tacit-laws-of-type-level-programming-in-haskell"><em>A primer on the cruel, tacit laws of type-level programming in Haskell</em></h4>

<p>Haskell programs are constructed at the junction of two worlds: one of types, and the other of values. Values are operational run-time entities that are denoted syntactically by <em>terms</em> in the code. To this end, types classify terms. They provide a powerful abstraction to organize data, determine how it should be stored in memory, passed through various operations, and more. On a superficial level, the difference between these worlds is simple: <em>types</em> refer to datatypes, which are either built-in (such as <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code>), or user-declared, for example:</p>

<pre><code>data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
</code></pre>

<p>By comparison, <em>values</em> are denoted by <em>terms</em> those types categorize (such as <code>1</code> and <code>"abc"</code> described by the standard library’s <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code> types, or <code>Cady</code> and <code>Regina</code> in the case of our user-declared type, <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>). Thus, the term <code>1</code> denotes a value that exists in memory only when the program is run.</p>

<p>In addition to these two worlds, a third, darker, and more elusive underworld of <em>kinds</em> also lurks in the shadows of Haskell programs. Haskell kinds can be as unpredictable and insidious as the soulless alpha-female of an elite high school clique. While daunting, understanding the coaction between these three worlds lays the foundation for type-level programming, a topic worth learning as it strengthens overall Haskell intuition.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/81239044-afe24580-8fd1-11ea-96b0-274cf839e834.png" alt="the haskell type system: a machine of constant, unforgiving judgement and rigid classification"></p>

<h3 id="kindness-is-a-virtue">Kindness is a virtue</h3>

<p>Much like counter-intuitive adolescent social dynamics, mastery of Haskell bears a steep learning curve because of its underlying complexity. It is difficult to wrap one’s head around the language’s typeclass hierarchies, category-theoretic roots, or the intricacies of compiler behavior. However, an intimate understanding of the type system lets programmers look beyond the chaos of code and apply a recognizable template by which to understand it.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-takes-patience">Kindness takes patience</h3>

<p>This topic is also difficult to master because it is both vast and subtle. Ideas underlying type-level programming are scattered across many disconnected resources focused on several corners of the Haskell ecosystem. Authoritative references on the topic (such as relevant library documentation) tend to assume familiarity with domain-specific terminology that may be unknown to non-experts. Due to the paucity of approachable materials on the subject, I’ve attempted to break down type-level programming into explanations of its constituent parts. While I don’t go into extensive depth on any individual section below, I hope to provide a valuable starting point with which readers can explore ideas in greater detail.</p>

<h3 id="types-vs-values">Types vs. Values</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, Haskell programs are divided into two worlds: the <em>type-level</em> and the <em>value-level</em>. The <em>type-level</em> refers to the part of a program analyzed by the static type-checking phase during compilation. Since every expression is assigned a type, code is checked against Haskell’s type system to ensure it fits <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>’s specified correctness criteria.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704534-fce9fd80-af27-11ea-9544-13961a56c444.png" alt="types classify terms, just like hostile teens with identity crises classify one another"></p>

<p>If the program is well-typed, the program will compile. However, this type-information evaporates once the compilation process terminates, leaving only <em>values</em> behind at run-time. In this way, types and values can be better distinguished by the phasing distinction, with types being compile-time entities and values being run-time entities.</p>

<p>For example, if a function takes a <code>String</code>, the type-checker doesn’t care if the <code>String</code> has a value denoted by <code>"abc"</code> or <code>"123"</code> or <code>"get in loser"</code>—so long as it’s a <code>String</code>. Type information gets discarded at run-time, leaving only the string’s value (ex.,<code>"get in loser"</code>). In some cases, however, we want the type system to care about what those values are and distinguish between them. The <code>DataKinds</code> extension, which we’ll explore below, lets us do that by allowing us to shove more information about our program into the type system. This lets us add meaning to the value of a <code>String</code> at the type-level, moving them from their usual, strictly run-time existence, into the compile-time phase. The technique allows us to use more information statically in the logical development and abstraction of the program’s behavior. We’re also able to add consequences that can halt compilation if the specific value of <code>String</code> doesn’t conform to the rules we’ve specified, or define classes over them.</p>

<h4 id="distinguishing-types-and-values-in-ghci">Distinguishing types and values in GHCi</h4>

<p>Let’s examine our aforementioned <code>SpringFlingQueen</code> datatype in GHCi. When we query the type of one of its constructors using <code>:t</code> (a handy shorthand for <code>:type</code>), we see that it is indeed of type <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
λ :t Cady
Cady :: SpringFlingQueen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider literals <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>. These are <em>values</em> of a type that parameterizes the <code>Num</code> class:</p>



<p>Typing <code>:t 1</code> into GHCi gives us <code>Num p =&gt; p</code>, indicating that a literal such as <code>1</code> can be of any polymorphic type <code>p</code> as long as the <code>Num</code> type class has instances for that type (for example, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code> both have <code>Num</code> instances and therefore are valid types that <code>p</code> could be instantiated with). This is possible due to <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_inference">type inference</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704346-ae3c6380-af27-11ea-8078-6f1ddfc7b238.png" alt="type inference can be used to deduce concrete types wherever they're obvious. If a type looks like a mouse, it's a mouse—duh!"></p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>Just like types classify terms, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1">kinds</a> classify types, and therefore are frequently described as “types of types”, or referred to be “one level up.” The “star” syntax (i.e., <code>*</code>) denotes kinds. It is defiantly used in this post despite <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0143-remove-star-kind.rst">recent syntactic changes</a>. A prerequisite for understanding the kind system necessitates comprehending the differences between three pairs of ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data constructors vs. type constructors:</strong> data constructors create values, whereas type constructors create types. Type constructors take one or more type arguments and produce a datatype when enough arguments are provided. This means that through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying">currying</a>, a type constructor can be <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially applied</a>. For example, the list type constructor <code>[]</code> may take a single type argument (ex. <code>String</code>) to denote the elements of the list (i.e., <code>[String]</code>). <code>[String]</code> is simply syntactic sugar for <code>[] String</code>, where the type <code>[]</code> is applied to <code>String</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full vs. partial application</strong> A partially-applied type, like a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially-applied function</a>, is one that is missing some of its data constructors. For instance, consider the list type <code>[]</code>. The kind of <code>[]</code> is <code>* -&gt; *</code>. A fully-applied list has data constructors, such as <code>[Int]</code>, and its kind is <code>*</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inhabited types vs. uninhabited types:</strong> An inhabitant of a type is precisely a value of that type. This means that <em>inhabited</em> types refer to the types that contain concrete values, such as the value denoted by the term <code>1 :: Int</code>. This suggests that the type <code>Int</code> is inhabited by value denoted by <code>1</code>. By contrast, <em>uninhabited</em> types refer to type constructors to which no values are abstracted. For instance, <code>Void</code> is uninhabited because it has no data constructors, and thus can not be used to construct a valid term. While <code>Void</code> may seem pointless at first, it can be a useful way to represent that a container is empty (ex., <code>[Void]</code>, which <em>is</em> inhabited by the term <code>[]</code> and the value this term denotes).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How do these ideas relate to the kind system? Well, all fully-applied runtime values are of kind <code>*</code> <em>and</em> they are inhabited. You can confirm this by typing <code>:k Int</code> and <code>:k String</code> in GHCi. However, this doesn’t work the other way around—just because a type is inhabited, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s fully-applied (ex., <code>[]</code> is not fully-applied but it <em>is</em> inhabited, and its kind signature is <code>* -&gt; *</code>). Conversely, all partially-applied types are uninhabited (since they don’t correspond to a value), but not all uninhabited types are partially applied. <code>Void</code> for instance is not partially-applied, but it is uninhabited.</p>

<p>To get the hang of this idea, consider the following examples:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Inhabited?</th>
      <th>Fully-applied?</th>
      <th>Kind</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Int</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>String</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[Int]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(,)</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Void</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either Void Void</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Kind signatures can be specified manually in GHCi using the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XKindSignatures"><code>XKindSignatures</code></a> extension. Try extending the above table by investigating the kind signatures of various types.</p>

<h3 id="higher-kinded-types">Higher-kinded types</h3>

<p>Just like there are higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), there are higher-kinded types (types constructors that take other type constructors as arguments). Type constructors such as <code>[]</code> are a first-class type, but also a higher-kinded type, given they take another type constructor to be reified:</p>



<p>Let’s consider <code>Functor</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :k Functor
Functor :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; Constraint
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> takes a type constructor <code>* -&gt; *</code> and returns a <code>Constraint</code>. Let’s use <code>:info</code> to examine <code>Functor</code> a bit more closely:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :info Functor
class Functor (f :: * -&gt; *) where
  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
  (&lt;$) :: a -&gt; f b -&gt; f a
  {-# MINIMAL fmap #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Functor ((,,,) a b c) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor ((,,) a b) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor Maybe -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> allows type constructors like <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> to have <code>Functor</code> instances, but not <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. This is because <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> are <code>* -&gt; *</code>, while <code>Int</code> has kind <code>*</code>. Similarly, <code>Either</code> has <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, which is why its instance above is parameterized with a type parameter denoting something of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>: <code>Either a</code>.</p>

However, sometimes you do not really need this level of control on your compute instances and that brings us to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail/" target="_blank">AWS Lightsail</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Lightsail as the name suggests is a lightweight version of EC2. Under the hood Lightsail instances are actually EC2 instances, but this is not apparent to the user and unlike the highly configurable EC2, Lightsail comes with a fixed configuration that once you provision cannot be changed. The billing is also a fixed amount per month as opposed to EC2 which is billed by the hour.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>To give you a sense of how much less complicated Lightsail is, please take a look at these screenshots of the EC2 dashboard and Lightsail dashboard.</p><figure id="w-node-7afe1c2bdee3-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef82a451ea3cd05dfd4c146_x93boOZlEeQGL9kcVSXPZyGOX3SNQJfDNyRC0qG3jNDCYeySdZpIgBzYgkVDZqq3DhR92f_Eqdp8sG-vIgkwltIW9ExWhshfDSsb-gd2qCah6E5VjydVhGxO4QFRA5qCR2KXqhP5.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-2074947a61a8-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef737f4a33047deb1c0a4a6_ZMr0t2QqxGgPZ-Grg-TIHjpok_ujhoYzyHLQnsGzlSfLJj0wRrKWFMKNnVDwCoOorYJHs6j4aqKz_NgztOFGNSNc9Fw4nKGrwSRVK7E4hQtDkzE7OXIVaQp0lDjXxwjiKkHN1e3c.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>EC2 dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>But we are not here to debate the complexity of EC2 vs Lightsail, so let’s let us talk about the cost.</p><p>An EC2 instance with 2 virtual cores, 4GB RAM and a storage of 80GB costs roughly 37$ a month and a Lightsail instance with the exact same configuration costs 20$ a month which is almost half the cost!</p><p>‍<br></p><p>The only drawback here as previously mentioned is that the instance is fixed and neither the storage nor the compute power can be tweaked later according to spikes in traffic and usage.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>In our case we do not have a need for too much storage on the compute instance, and as for the computing power it was easy for us to simply provision another Lightsail instance when there is an increase in traffic and set it up behind a load balancer. This way our system is still scalable.</p><p><strong>Database instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Choosing a database provider for your application can be a tricky decision, but on a high level there is just one thing that is absolutely required for any database provider - the ability to take regular backups of the DB automatically and the ability to restore the database from one of the backups.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this functionality is provided by AWS RDS along with an array of other capabilities like autoscaling of storage, multiple availability zones, etc. However we did not not really need this level of control over the DB for our simple SaaS product, not to mention the fact that RDS would cost us a minimum of 200$ a month with the lowest acceptable configuration.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again our saviour was Lightsail which provides managed Databases with a fixed storage at very cheap prices. Only MySQL and PostgreSQL are available though which was fine with us since I am quite comfortable with MySQL. We have currently provisioned one MySQL DB with 2 vCPUS, 4GB RAM and 120GB SSD and it costs us 60$ a month.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>And as mentioned before Lightsail provides the basic capabilities of backups and restoration.</p><figure id="w-node-e1f43dee380f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef731c812136072299e133c_Q2n6wprxbcqgh5vI97YqjWYkOYV52HGzRtHXIQFfpgxwlHkGaO8YDv3aO3V-PwM2SI4qxPty6ZMlK0siv1-lAizSl9hf_6RASDqzNrSfEmIeMdu8UeSTsRhu4Sk1Ofg6Uw8CPPuK.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Database restoration from recent backup</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><div><p>The drawback here is that the DB will not scale automatically so your will have to make sure that your application does not use storage beyond what is available in the instance you select. We do this by regularly purging our Database of data that is older than X days and data that belongs to users who churned from our app more than X days ago and haven’t come back since.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Caching instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>For our application we needed a Caching layer as well as the ability to queue up jobs that can be executed asynchronously. The seasoned folks here might have realised that the best tool to use for this is Redis and AWS has a service called ElastiCache which is Redis under the hood.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again this would be a very safe choice to make because it is completely managed and scalable. Our need was a Redis instance with at least 6GB of memory and 2vCPUs and if we went with ElastiCache our cost would roughly come out to be 112$ a month, not to mention the additional cost of running our async workers somewhere else.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>I might sound like a broken record at this point but what we ended up doing was to provision a Lightsail instance with 2vCPUs and 8GB of memory for the cost of 40$ a month and installed an open source version of Redis on this instance. We also use the same instance to run our asynchronous workers which read from the Redis queue and execute jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So what is the drawback? Well since it is not a managed service, you would have to monitor the Redis server yourself. There are many tools out there that help you do this and the one I would recommend is<a href="http://prometheus.io/" target="_blank"> prometheus.io</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This means that you have to do a little bit of extra work to setup metrics collection from your Redis instance and use a grafana dashboard where you can view these metrics, but this extra work saves a lot of money in the long run and you get to look at a super cool dashboard like this one</p><figure id="w-node-ed9ef23d383f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b6832df460f9189c1ef_8fAYGJqB0CXvglSTkg-wXPXqpKi2e3fusNyMcOaiepfnZ-dC1kjn2Do44sILw5lbKOSISB1CMTEdCzyqBcyggDwK4tJcDEA17xkWXb2J1tUjLHBJgtMa_t3ekfIUfOiImx5IaZd6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Grafana dashboard for monitoring redis instance</figcaption></figure><p><strong>CDN</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Our application requires a javascript file to be loaded into the websites of our customers. This JS file gets a ton of traffic because this traffic scales according to how many visitors our customers get. Now this can be scary because it means we really had no idea how many requests the JS file might actually end up receiving so we hesitated to go with CloudFront which is the goto solution for a CDN on AWS.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So we ended up taking an entirely different approach for this. Our application is a Shopify app and during the process of building the application we created a Shopify store. Every Shopify store gets its own personal CDN where you can manually upload anything and it will be served over the Shopify CDN. So we minified and uploaded our JS file to the CDN of our Shopify store and now we serve 20000 Shopify stores using this method at zero cost.</p><figure id="w-node-78b80f124ebd-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b68374cfd3932d127f5_z2vfALB6_5FJXMp4al-65PIczwKOE-wUb0TubqBXAFMiu0rnqPEKGAOl12Saf0Xn-Ay1DjWL7wIj7Vby1sNPfLHkpuXzHf17ytoJ5gQvql13DZl1BsIV2rJPeHgfnCnIdezWiddG.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Shopify CDN&nbsp;that is free of cost</figcaption></figure><p>There is a glaring drawback to this approach. The Shopify store CDN does not provide an API that you can use to programmatically upload files and it has to be done manually. Also unlike CloudFront, there is no option of invalidating a file once it is uploaded. So If you have to make updates to your file you would have to upload a new file and migrate all of your existing users to this new file.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p>This might sound like a big drawback, but it actually took me an hour to whip up a script that updates the JS file for all our existing 20000 stores to the updated JS file that I provide. So whenever I make a new release to this JS file, I simply upload a new file manually to the CDN, then take that file as the input and run this script and we re live! This approach works for us because we do not make too many releases to the JS&nbsp;file to begin with.</p><p><strong>Web server + load balancer</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Every application requires the ability to route requests coming to their domain or subdomain to various applications running under the hood. The best way to do this is to use AWS ELB which can be used to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This sounds quite fancy, but all we needed for our product was 4 things</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Serving static files for our application dashboard</li><li>Distribute traffic among different Lightsail instances based on the path of the incoming URL</li><li>Load balance traffic that comes from our Merchants Shopify stores amongst N identical Lightsail instances.</li><li>Rate limiting of requests to prevent DDOS attacks.</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this can be done using NGINX which is a great piece of software and is quite robust even with the default settings that it comes with.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we simply installed a stable version of NGINX on one of our existing Lightsail instances which was already being used to host one of our server applications. We also use<a href="http://amplify.nginx.com/" target="_blank"> amplify.nginx.com</a> for monitoring it. This setup is pretty much equivalent to using a managed service at zero cost.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-26b2c44e15ee-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef730c34b26677e785fa7ea_w67-tKkFsy_LekSEhO_PXqnHGxDiREqENBgMBaEAOqotyjEDJoKXRk6Wpd5K86OOv2z_S-ejGOnL37l6lj6MWqE_x2ZvrIZ4FCQraAC1uDWMne7yi0Fme4Jap2sp2uH2zrKdvpTz.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Amplify dashboard for monitoring health of the NGINX server</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Use lightsail instances (20$ per instance) instead of EC2 instances (37$ per instance)</li><li>Use a lightsail database (60$ per DB) instead of RDS (200$ per DB)</li><li>Use a self hosted redis server on a compute instance (40$) instead of ElastiCache (112$)&nbsp;</li><li>If feasible, use a free CDN (cost savings depends on traffic size)</li><li>Use a self hosted NGINX server (20$ fixed cost) instead of ELB (cost depends on traffic and usage)</li></ul><p><strong>Closing notes</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I would like to put emphasis on the fact that we are a micro-SaaS product that solves a small and specific use case and therefore this kind of AWS setup worked for us.

                <a href="https://blog.mostlypointless.dev/tags/raspberry-pi">raspberry pi</a>
            
        
        <p>Almost two months ago, I started building a four node Raspberry Pi 4 cluster for a project I’m working on. Figuring out the best way to get Linux on each node lead me down a rabbit hole and I spent the next four weeks <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html">yak shaving</a>.</p>
<p>The most common way to boot a Pi is from an SD card. But they are slow and unreliable - I don’t like them. Certain models of Pi 2 and Pi 3 support <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md">booting from USB storage</a>, but Pi 4 cannot do that yet. So, I’m stuck with using an SD card for each Pi. Or so I thought.</p>
<h3 id="enter-pxe-boot">Enter PXE boot</h3>
<p>Turns out, Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 also <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net.md">support network booting</a>. A beta firmware was released late last year that enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a> for Pi 4. I found <a href="https://linuxhit.com/raspberry-pi-pxe-boot-netbooting-a-pi-4-without-an-sd-card">an article on LinuxHit</a> detailing the process of installing the firmware and setting up network boot.</p>
<p>Just to test this out, I updated the firmware and configured PXE server on one of the Pis. I tried booting another Pi over the network and…it worked!
Here is the gist of PXE server setup process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the contents of <code>/boot</code> and the rest of <code>/</code> into separate folders on your local filesystem. I copied mine to <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Install and configure <code>dnsmasq</code> to enable TFTP and use <code>/tftp</code> as <code>tftp-root</code></li>
<li>Install and configure NFS server to share <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code></li>
<li>Edit the contents of <code>/nfs/raspbian-root/fstab</code> to mount the boot partition.</li>
<li>Edit <code>/nfs/raspbian-boot/cmdline.txt</code> to</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/raspbian-root,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><h3 id="pxe-booting-3-nodes-using-overlayfs">PXE booting 3 nodes using OverlayFS</h3>
<p>I cannot just boot all three nodes from the same boot and root filesystems since they are not read-only. And I don’t want to maintain a copy of these for each node. But this is a solved problem - Docker already lets you spin up multiple containers from a single base image. So I’ll just do <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/#how-the-overlay2-driver-works">what Docker does</a> - create <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html">OverlayFS</a> for each node using raspbian-root and raspbian-boot as my lower directories. I’ll share them over NFS like before.</p>
<p>Configuration for one of the nodes is below. Other two nodes follow the same pattern. Note that I moved raspbian-root and raspbian-boot to a USB hard drive (mounted at <code>/mnt</code>) to get better r/w performance. dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX is the MAC address of the node. I’m using <code>tftp-unique-root=mac</code> option in <code>dnsmasq</code> to maintain a separate boot environment for each node based on its MAC address.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ mount -t overlay nog-boot -o lowerdir<span>=</span>/mnt/raspbian-boot,upperdir<span>=</span>/mnt/upper/nog-boot,workdir<span>=</span>/mnt/work/nog-boot -o nfs_export<span>=</span>on -o index<span>=</span>on -o redirect_dir<span>=</span>nofollow /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX

</code></pre></div><p>(In case you are wondering what <code>nog</code> is: I name my servers after planets from the Star Wars universe. Following this tradition, I’ve named the Pis Mandalore (PXE server), Nog, Ordo and Werda)</p>
<p>You are probably thinking that this worked. It did not.</p>
<p>NFS and OverlayFS did not play nice with each other. After a weekend trying to work around some weird issues, I gave up.</p>
<p>But OverlayFS is not the only copy-on-write filesystem in existence, is it? ZFS and BTRFS offer <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-subvolume">subvolumes and snapshots</a> that I can use instead. But not before I <del>procrastinate</del> spend 2 weeks deciding which one to use.</p>
<h3 id="moving-to-btrfs">Moving to BTRFS</h3>
<p>The plan is simple: I’ll create a subvolume each for raspbian-root and raspbian-boot. I’ll then create three snapshots of each subvolume - one for every node. I created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">btrfs file system</a> on my external drive and ran the following commands</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-root
$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-boot

<span># Repeat the following for each node changing folder names as necessary</span>
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-boot nog-boot
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-root nog-root
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-boot /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-root /nfs/nog

<span># Don’t forget to edit cmdline.txt for each node</span>
$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt
console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/nog,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><p>Well, this worked! I have a Pi running without an SD card!! Now all I have to do is create systemd unit files to start all required services and mount snapshots. I can finally start working on my project.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Take a closer look at the output of <code>cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.
If you are like me, you will realize for the first time that <code>root=</code> in this file defines where the root filesystem will be mounted from. Right now, we are telling it to mount from <code>/dev/nfs</code>. What if I attach an external drive and set <code>root=</code> to point to the external drive?</p>
<h3 id="network-booting-into-a-usb-hard-drive">Network booting into a USB hard drive</h3>
<p>RPi 4 cannot directly boot from a USB drive. As in - it cannot find <code>/boot</code> on a USB drive when powering on. But what if we provide <code>/boot</code> with network boot and mount <code>/</code> from a USB drive using <code>cmdline.txt</code>? Time to test.</p>
<p>I copied raspbian-root to a USB drive, edited <code>fstab</code> to mount <code>/</code> using the partition’s PARTUUID and connected it to Nog. I then updated the contents of <code>/tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt

</code></pre></div><p>After a couple of reboots, it worked! I now have a RPi 4 running off a USB hard drive!</p>
<h3 id="what-did-i-gain">What did I gain?</h3>
<p>Let’s start with what I was looking for. All I wanted was to not deal with SD cards because they are slow and unreliable. Reliability is relative - everything fails at some point. But a decent quality USB hard drive will likely outlive an SD card. So let’s just look at some read/write performance numbers and see how they compare.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sync; dd <span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero of<span>=</span>twogeefile bs<span>=</span>1M count<span>=</span>2048; sync  <span># Write performance</span>
$ sudo sh -c <span>"sync &amp;&amp; echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"</span>
$ dd <span>if</span><span>=</span>twogeefile of<span>=</span>/dev/null bs<span>=</span>1M count<span>=</span><span>2048</span>              <span># Read performance</span>
</code></pre></div><table>

<p>With network boot, I was able to get read and write speeds similar to a class 10 SD card. Note that the boot images are hosted on a USB hard drive connected to Mandalore (PXE server). NFS seems to be the bottleneck here - raw r/w speeds of the hard drive are much better than this. All Pis are connected to Netgear’s 8 port gigabit ethernet switch.</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, things improve considerably when Pis are running off a USB hard disk. Note that the external drives I used are 5400RPM hard disks repurposed from very old MacBooks. I bought them on eBay for $10 a pop. YMMV.</p>
<h3 id="current-setup">Current setup</h3>
<p>Right now, I have Mandalore booting from an SD card and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk. Nog, Ordo and Werda fetch <code>/boot</code> from Mandalore over the network and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk.</p>

   <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
   <p>This specification uses pluggable protocols, with QUIC <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-quic-transport">[QUIC-TRANSPORT]</a> as
one such protocol, to send data to and receive data from servers. It can be
used like WebSockets but with support for multiple streams, unidirectional
streams, out-of-order delivery, and reliable as well as unreliable transport.</p>
   <p role="note"><span>Note:</span> The API presented in this specification represents a preliminary proposal
based on work-in-progress within the IETF QUIC WG. Since the QUIC transport
specification is a work-in-progress, both the protocol and API are likely to
change significantly going forward.</p>
   <h2 data-level="2" id="conformance"><span>2. </span><span>Conformance</span><a href="#conformance"></a></h2>
   <p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines,
diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
   <p>The key words <em>MUST</em> and <em>SHOULD</em> are to be interpreted as described in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
   <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product:
the user agent that implements the interfaces that it contains.</p>
   <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
   <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this
specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript
Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-webidl">[WEBIDL]</a>, as this
specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

 datagrams in favor of newer datagrams. The number of datagrams to queue
 should be kept small enough to avoid adding significant latency to packet
 delivery when the stream is being read slowly (due to the reader being slow)
 but large enough to avoid dropping packets when for the stream is not read
 for short periods of time (due to the reader being paused).</p>

  <p>Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with security by default. Deno tends to substitute Node.js with a simpler, modern, and more secure runtime.</p>
<p>Deno is built on V8, Rust, and <a href="https://tokio.rs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Tokio homepage">Tokio</a>, a Rust asynchronous runtime environment. It aims to be a productive and secure scripting environment for the modern world of programming, Deno is for you!</p>
<p>If you want to learn Deno you are in the right section.</p>
<p>Our Deno tutorial is designed for simplicity. We also have tons of examples to get you in the game.</p>
<h2>Deno Example Code</h2>
<pre><code>function generateRandom(max_number) {
  return Math.ceil(Math.random() * max_number);
}

console.log(generateRandom(5));</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://lyty.dev/diy/deno-typescript-random-number-example.html" target="_blank"><i>launch</i>&nbsp; Do It Yourself</a></p>
<h2>What Can Deno Do?</h2>
<p>Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime environment, this means that you can use Deno to process server-side actions by writing JavaScript or TypeScript. Think of anything that other server-side programming languages can do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deno can <strong>serve</strong> web pages dynamically (like PHP, NodeJS, ASP, and other server-side languages).</li>
<li>Deno can <strong>create</strong>, <strong>open</strong>, <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong>, <strong>delete</strong>, and <strong>close</strong> files on the server</li>
<li>Deno can be used to <strong>build</strong> command-line based applications</li>
<li>Deno can <strong>interact</strong> with any kind of database</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Use Deno?</h2>
<p>Think of anything other server-side programming languages can do, then think <strong>security</strong>, <strong>simplicity</strong>, and <strong>modernization </strong>with Deno.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security by default. No file, network, or environment access (unless explicitly enabled).</li>
<li>It is a TypeScript runtime, which means it supports TypeScript out of the box.</li>
<li>Comes with a single executable (<code>deno</code>).</li>
<li>Ships with built-in tools that make code inspection and formatting easy,&nbsp; the <code>deno info</code> and <code>deno fmt</code>.</li>
<li>You can bundle scripts into a single JavaScript file and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who Can Learn Deno?</h2>
<p>Deno can be learned by anyone, provided that you have the basic knowledge of <strong>JavaScript </strong>especially about <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>
<h2>Comparisons to Node.js</h2>
<div><table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Deno</td>
<td>NodeJS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No package manager. Uses modules referenced as URLs or file paths</td>
<td>Has a package manager called <code>npm</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deno does not use <code>package.json</code> in its module resolution algorithm</td>
<td>Uses <code>package.json</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All async actions in Deno return a promise. Thus Deno provides different APIs than Node.</td>
<td>In Node.js, async can be promise or function-based</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deno requires explicit permissions for file, network, and environment access (for security purposes).</td>
<td>Node.js does not require this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deno always dies (exits) on uncaught errors</td>
<td>Node.js may not die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Uses "ES Modules" and does not support <code>require()</code>. Third-party modules are imported via URLs: <code>import * as log from "https://deno.land/std/log/mod.ts";</code></td>
<td>Node.js uses both <code>require()</code> and the ES <code>import</code>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>You can start our Deno Tutorial by clicking the 'Next Chapter' button below.</p>
<h2>What You Should Know at the End of This Lesson</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should understand when <strong>Deno</strong> is.</li>
<li>You should understand the core value of <strong>Deno </strong>(security, speed, and modern).</li>
<li>You should know that <strong>Deno </strong>is TypeScript-code and the standard file extensions are <code>.js</code> and&nbsp;<code>.ts</code></li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The language of mathematics is distinct from natural languages in that it aims to communicate abstract, logical ideas with precision and unambiguity. As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think. In fact, in what follows, we’ve compiled a list of 106 such terms — along with some in-depth exploration of their <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>implications</strong>.</p><p>So if you’re ready to dive into this fascinating world that is known as mathematics, then let’s get started!</p><p>(and if you’re looking for a concise rendition of all the 106 terms featured in this glossary, then you might find the following <strong>higher math jargon mindmap</strong> both interesting and useful.)</p> <p><span><a href="#" target="_self"><span><strong>Download the 4-Page Higher Mathematical Jargon Mindmap</strong></span></a></span></p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png" alt="The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargons" width="1366" height="702" srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png 1130w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-600x308.png 600w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-768x395.png 768w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-1024x526.png 1024w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" title="Math Glossary Header Image" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201366%20702'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png 1130w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-600x308.png 600w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-768x395.png 768w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-1024x526.png 1024w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-300x154.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png"></p><h2 id="toc">Higher Mathematical Jargon — The Definitive List (106 Terms)</h2><p><span> The definitive glossary of higher mathematical jargon — from abstract nonsense, elementary proof to singularity and 101+ more. </span> <span><span>Click to Tweet</span><i></i></span></p><h2 id="abstraction"><a href="#toc">Abstraction</a></h2><p>The process of extracting the underlying <strong>structures</strong>, <strong>patterns</strong>, or <strong>properties</strong> of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects.

And since such arguments are often highly abstract and long-winded by nature, they are also alternatively referred to as “<strong>general abstract nonsense</strong>” or “<strong>generalized abstract nonsense</strong>“.</p><h2 id="aon"><a href="#toc">Abuse of notation</a></h2><p>The act of inadvertently or deliberately using notations in a way that’s not entirely<strong> syntactically correct</strong> — but which simplifies the exposition and makes the passage easier to understand. For example, one might say that:</p><ul><li>“$\mathbb{R}$ is distributive” — rather than “$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is distributive.”</li><li>“$3$ is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $x \mapsto 3$ for all real $x$, is differentiable.”</li><li>“$a+b+c = c+b+a$” — rather than “$(a+b) + c = (c+b) + a$”.</li></ul><p>In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a <strong>misuse of notation</strong> — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$).</p><h2 id="algo"><a href="#toc">Algorithm</a></h2><p>A finite series of <a href="#welldefined">well-defined</a>, <strong>computer-implementable instructions</strong> to solve a specific set of computable problems. It takes a finite amount of initial input(s), processes them unambiguously at each operation, before returning its outputs within a finite amount of time. Some examples of algorithm in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong> (for finding the greatest common factor of two natural numbers)</li><li><a href="https://mathvault.ca/long-division">The <strong>long division algorithm</strong> (and its variants)</a></li><li>The <strong>simplex algorithm</strong> (for finding the optimal solution under a set of linear constraints)</li></ul><p>In essence, algorithms are created to streamline the solution-finding process for a specific set of problems, though it can also remove the necessity of thinking and understanding in the process. For a a series of instructions that are quasi-algorithmic and broader in nature, the term “<strong>general procedure</strong>” is sometimes used (which, like an algorithm, could also involve some element of <a href="#heuristics">heuristics</a> or <a href="#recursion">recursion</a>).</p><h2 id="almost"><a href="#toc">Almost</a></h2><div id="attachment_18414"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18414" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png" alt="Dart and Board" width="225" height="225" srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png 225w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-150x150.png 150w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-100x100.png 100w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-220x220.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" title="Dart and Board" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20225%20225'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png 225w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-150x150.png 150w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-100x100.png 100w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-220x220.png 220w" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png"></p><p id="caption-attachment-18414">Since the actual circumference of the board has area 0, the probability of hitting it is also 0 as well (i.e., almost never).</p></div><p>A handy adverb similar to its usage in English, but can take on specific meanings depending on the context. For example:</p><ul><li>“<strong>Almost all</strong> elements in a set” usually means “all but a finite/countable amount of negligible elements in the set.”</li><li>“<strong>Almost no</strong> integer” usually means “only a finite subset of integers.”</li><li>“A property holds <strong>almost everywhere</strong> (in a measure space)” usually means “everywhere in a set except a subset of<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MeasureZero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> measure zero</a>.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost surely</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 1, even though it does not include all of the possible outcomes.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost never</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 0, even though it does contain some of the possible outcomes.”</li></ul><p>Here, notice that “almost” doesn’t necessarily mean that the <strong>exceptional cases</strong> are “small”, and hence one is perfectly well-justified in making claims such as “almost all real numbers are transcendental” — or that “the dart almost never lands on the circumference of the board.”</p><h2 id="ansatz"><a href="#toc">Ansatz</a></h2><p>A term of German origin meaning “initial placement of a tool at a work piece” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>), and is used in mathematics to refer to the initial, additional <strong>mathematical assumptions</strong> made to kick start the problem solving process — but which are later confirmed to be parts of the actual solution as well.

    <p>A bit more than four years ago I started the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">xi-editor</a> project. Now I have placed it on the back burner (though there is still some activity from the open source community).</p>

<p>The original goal was to deliver a very high quality editing experience. To this end, the project spent a rather large number of “novelty points”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rust as the implementation language for the core.</li>
  <li>A rope data structure for text storage.</li>
  <li>A multiprocess architecture, with front-end and plug-ins each with their own process.</li>
  <li>Fully embracing async design.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> as a mechanism for concurrent modification.</li>
</ul>

<p>I still believe it would be possible to build a high quality editor based on the original design. But I <em>also</em> believe that this would be quite a complex system, and require significantly more work than necessary.</p>

<p>I’ve written the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">CRDT part of this retrospective</a> already, as a comment in response to a Github issue. That prompted good <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">discussion</a> on Hacker News. In this post, I will touch again on CRDT but will focus on the other aspects of the system design.</p>

<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>

<p>The original motivation for xi came from working on the Android text stack, and confronting two problems in particular. One, text editing would become very slow as the text buffer got bigger. Two, there were a number of concurrency bugs in the interface between the EditText widget and the keyboard (input method editor).</p>

<p>The culprit of the first problem turned out to be the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/SpanWatcher">SpanWatcher</a> interface, combined with the fact that modern keyboards like to put a spelling correction span on each word. When you insert a character, all the successive spans bump their locations up by one, and then you have to send onSpanChanged for each of those spans to all the watchers. Combined with the fact that the spans data structure had a naive O(n) implementation, and the whole thing was quadratic or worse.</p>

<p>The concurrency bugs boil down to synchronizing edits across two different processes, because the keyboard is a different process than the application hosting the EditText widget. Thus, when you send an update (to move the cursor, for example) and the text on the other side is changing concurrently, it’s ambiguous whether it refers to the old or new location. This was handled in an “almost correct” style, with timeouts for housekeeping updates to minimize the chance of a race. A nice manifestation of that is that swiping the cursor slowly through text containing complex emoji could cause flashes of the emoji breaking.</p>

<p>These problems have a unifying thread: in both cases there are small diffs to the text, but then the data structures and protocols handled these diffs in a less than optimal way, leading to both performance and correctness bugs.</p>

<p>To a large extent, xi started as an exploration into the “right way” to handle text editing operations. In the case of the concurrency bugs, I was hoping to find a general, powerful technique to facilitate concurrent text editing in a distributed-ish system. While most of the Operational Transformation literature is focused on multiple users collaboratively editing a document, I was hoping that other text manipulations (like an application enforcing credit card formatting on a text input field) could fit into the general framework.</p>

<p>That was also the time I was starting to get heavily into Rust, so it made natural sense to start prototyping a new green-field text editing engine. How would you “solve text” if you were free of backwards compatibility constraints (a huge problem in Android)?</p>

<p>When I started, I knew that Operational Transformation was a solution for collaborative editing, but had a reputation for being complex and finicky. I had no idea how deep the rabbithole would be of OT and then CRDT. Much of that story is told in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">CRDT discussion</a> previously linked.</p>

<h2 id="the-lure-of-modular-software">The lure of modular software</h2>

<p>There is an extremely long history of people trying to build software as composable modules connected by some kind of inter-module communication fabric. Historical examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCE/RPC">DCE/RPC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture">Corba</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo_(GNOME)">Bonobo</a>, and more recently things like <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">Sandstorm</a> and <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/modular/module">Fuchsia Modular</a>. There are some partial successes, including <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Binder">Binder</a> on Android, but this is still mostly an unrealized vision. (Regarding Binder, it evolved from a much more idealistic vision, and I strongly recommend reading this 2006 interview about <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/13674/introduction-to-openbinder-and-interview-with-dianne-hackborn/">OpenBinder</a>).</p>

<p>When I started xi, there were signs we were getting there. Microservices were becoming popular in the Internet world, and of course all Web apps have a client/server boundary. Within Google, <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> was working fairly well, as was the internal process separation within Chrome. In Unix land, there’s a long history of the terminal itself presenting a GUI (if primitive, though gaining features such as color and mouse). There’s also the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> and then, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> and X11.</p>

<p>I think one of the strongest positive models was the database / business logic split, which is arguably the most successful example of process separation. In this model, the database is responsible for performance and integrity, and the business logic is in a separate process, so it can safely do things like crash and hang. I very much thought of xi-core as a database-like engine, capable of handling concurrent text modification much like a database handles transactions.</p>

<p>Building software in such a modular way requires two things: first, infrastructure to support remote procedure calls (including serialization of the requests and data), and second, well-defined interfaces. Towards the end of 2017, I saw the goal of xi-editor as <em>primarily</em> being about defining the interfaces needed for large scale text editing, and that this work could endure over a long period of time even as details of the implementation changed.</p>

<p>For the infrastructure, we chose JSON (about which more below) and hand-rolled our own xi-rpc layer (based on JSON-RPC). It turns out there are a lot of details to get right, including dealing with error conditions, negotiating when two ends of the protocol aren’t exactly on the same version, etc.</p>

<p>One of the bolder design decisions in xi was to have a process separation between front-end and core. This was inspired in part by <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, in which everything is a plugin, even GUI. But the main motivation was to build GUI applications using Rust, even though at the time Rust was nowhere near capable of native GUI. The idea is that you use the best GUI technology of the platform, and communicate via async pipes.</p>

<p>One argument for process separation is to improve overall system reliability. For example, Chrome has a process per tab, and if the process crashes, all you get is an “Aw, snap” without bringing the whole browser down. I think it’s worth asking the question: is it useful to have the front-end continue after the core crashes, or the other way around? I think probably not; in the latter case it might be able to safely save the file, but you can also do that by frequently checkpointing.</p>

<p>Looking back, I see much of the promise of modular software as addressing goals related to project management, not technical excellence. Ideally, once you’ve defined an inter-module architecture, then smaller teams can be responsible for their own module, and the cost of coordination goes down. I think this type of project management structure is especially appealing to large companies, who otherwise find it difficult to manage larger projects. And the tax of greater overall complexity is often manageable, as these big companies tend to have more resources.</p>

<h3 id="json">JSON</h3>

<p>The choice of JSON was controversial from the start. It did end up being a source of friction, but for surprising reasons.</p>

<p>The original vision was to write plug-ins in any language, especially for things like language servers that would be best developed in the language of that ecosystem. This is the main reason I chose JSON, because I expected there would be high quality implementations in every viable language.</p>

<p>Many people complained about the fact that JSON escapes strings, and suggested alternatives such as <a href="https://msgpack.org/index.html">MessagePack</a>. But I knew that the speed of raw JSON parsing was a solved problem, with a number of extremely high performance implementations (<a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> is a good example).</p>

<p>Even so, aside from the general problems of modular software as described above, JSON was the source of two additional problems. For one, <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-mac/issues/102">JSON in Swift is shockingly slow</a>. There are <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/rearchitecting-jsonencoder-to-be-much-faster/28139">discussions on improving it</a> but it’s still a problem. This is surprising to me considering how important it is in many workloads, and the fact that it’s clearly possible to write a high performance JSON implementation.</p>

<p>Second, on the Rust side, while <a href="https://serde.rs/">serde</a> is quite fast and very convenient (thanks to proc macros), when serializing a large number of complex structures, it bloats code size considerably. The xi core is 9.3 megabytes in a Linux release build (debug is an eye-watering 88MB), and a great deal of that bloat is serialization. There is work to reduce this, including <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/miniserde">miniserde</a> and <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/nanoserde">nanoserde</a>, but serde is still by far the most mainstream.</p>

<p>I believe it’s possible to do performant, clean JSON across most languages, but people should know, we’re not there yet.</p>

<h2 id="the-rope">The rope</h2>

<p>There are only a few data structures suitable for representation of text in a text editor. I would enumerate them as: contiguous string, gapped buffer, array of lines, piece table, and rope. I would consider the first unsuitable for the goals of xi-editor as it doesn’t scale well to large documents, though its simplicity is appealing, and memcpy is fast these days; if you know your document is always under a megabyte or so, it’s probably the best choice.</p>

<p>Array of lines has performance failure modes, most notably very long lines. Similarly, many good editors have been written using piece tables, but I’m not a huge fan; performance is very good when first opening the file, but degrades over time.</p>

<p>My favorite aspect of the rope as a data structure is its excellent …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>My Twitter feels like a local library. Each one of my Twitter friends is tending to their own little corner of the internet, sharing their best material, and responding to my random research questions. There are a lot of knowledgable folks out there, but <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/[@visakanv](https://twitter.com/visakanv">Visakan Veerasamy</a> is the ultimate librarian. I like to think of him as the crown prince of Nerd Twitter —&nbsp;a writer, creator, and curator who’s so prolific he doesn’t recognize himself. Visa is playing the Twitter game on a whole new level. He’s constructing a digital version of his brain, and his curation style feels like an early iteration of something that might one day go mainstream. It’s a knowledge creation and exploration ethos that feels more true to the original “web” and more fit for how we think.</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/visa.png">
<em>Visa’s Twitter profile, complete with his personal web of values.</em></p>

<p>Inspired by his huge web of knowledge, I sent out a tweet three months ago that said: “I think I would legit pay for @visakanv as a service. $10/mo for him to respond to all of my random musings with his own thoughts, content recommendations, and links to relevant threads. This service would be like Mario racing turbo boost for the mind!”</p>

<p>To my surprise, Visa responded within a few minutes. “Happy to do this,” he said, and shared a link to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/visakanv">Patreon</a>.</p>

<h3>A brief history of tweetstorms</h3>

<p>Visa’s digital brain is made up of Twitter threads. He didn’t invent the medium, but he’s pushed it to its limits.</p>

<p>When Marc Andreessen started tweeting in 2014, he didn’t let the 140-character limit stop him from posting his thoughts at length. Instead of shortening his tweets, he started stringing them together by replying to himself. Thus was born the tweetstorm. At first, tweetstorms were a hack. And they were mildly <a href="http://expletiveinserted.com/2014/07/02/taming-tweetstorms/">controversial</a>. Gawker once <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/uber-ceo-posts-13-tweet-apology-without-answering-a-sin-1660229634">slammed</a> Travis Kalanick’s use of a tweetstorm, calling it “a series of thoughts that give the illusion of substance and circumspection because they are presented in a numerical order.” Tech blogger/investor M.G. Siegler raged against them in 2014:</p>

<blockquote><p>1/ In theory, 2/ I love Tweetstorms 3/ and have long wanted a feature like this myself. 4/ But in practice, 5/ I f*cking hate them. 6/ They flow in the tweet stream about as nicely as vomit out of an esophagus. 7/ They ruin the experience of the stream by breaking what Twitter is, 8/ a service to share short thoughts quickly 9/ and let others reply to those in some semblance of order.</p></blockquote>

<p>At first, creating tweetstorms was a <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/08/21/twitter-jargon-illustrated-rt-mt-canoes-darth/">very manual process</a>, and they weren’t very easy to read or share. Fast-forward three years: in 2017, Twitter officially productized tweestorms and rebranded them as “threads.” Suddenly, it was much simpler to string tweets together and share the resulting thread as a unit. This product change created the infrastructure on which Visa and others are currently spinning their webs.</p>

<h3>Resurrecting the Memex</h3>

<p>I found Visa’s threads sometime last year, and I’ve been crawling across them ever since. Whereas Marc Andressen’s threads were mostly self-contained, Visa’s are linked together. They form a giant web of interconnected thoughts. There’s no beginning or ending or map or wayfinding or sense of where you are in his tapestry. There are just threads of threads of threads that seem to extend into infinity —&nbsp;an ever-expanding network of Visa’s ideas and discoveries. At each node, there’s usually a full-on discussion taking place between his followers. Visa has constructed what feels like a whole new medium on top of the bedrock of Twitter. Here’s a representative thread for you to explore:</p>

<blockquote data-lang="en"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’ve been stewing this theory for 1 year +:</p><p>Just as how the WWE isn’t a wrestling show, but a show ABOUT a wrestling show,</p><p>mainstream media is less about the news than a participatory interactive tv show ABOUT the news</p><p>Cable News Network is really Cable News Entertainment <a href="https://t.co/QZO2t8I9fI">https://t.co/QZO2t8I9fI</a></p></div>— Visa is in SF until May 8! 🌉 (@visakanv) <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1004190525270851584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2018</a></blockquote>





<p>Visa’s threads are doing to Twitter what hyperlinks did to dead-tree text. They link things together across time and space. Without thread-webs, most tweets get left behind in the past. A web of tweets allows people to rediscover older thoughts and connect them with newer ones.</p>

<p>These threads bear a family resemblance to the vision of an early 20th-century computer pioneer named Vannevar Bush. In 1945, he wrote a now-famous article called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>, which described a knowledge device he called the Memex:</p>

<blockquote><p>Man cannot hope fully to duplicate [his] mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways, he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed of flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence an clarity of the items resurrected from storage … <strong>Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/memex.jpg"></p>

<p>Bush’s vision of associative trails has been realized in some corners of the web, like Wikipedia. But most content is organized in the reverse-chronological stream (also known as the feed or the timeline). Social media sites have made information consumption a very linear process. We scroll down infinitely long pages that are (roughly) organized from newest to oldest. Content that’s more than a week old is fossilized under the endless dump of new posts, links, pictures. On social media, time is the main ordering principle. Creating new content feels like throwing a leaf into a roaring river. It’s not attached to anything — it just floats on by, doomed to be forgotten within a matter of seconds. We don’t really “surf” the web anymore. Unless we’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikirace">Wiki-racing</a>, we’re not hopping from hyperlink to hyperlink on a surprising journey across  human knowledge. We scroll, click, scroll click.</p>

<p>I see Visa’s Twitter threads as a response to this boring linearity&nbsp;— an attempt to make things hang together. We’re associative beings. We make sense of things by relating them to other things. As Joshua Foer wrote in his book <em>Moonwalking With Einstein:</em> “It takes knowledge to gain knowledge. Memory is like a spiderweb that catches information. The more it catches, the bigger it grows. And the bigger it grows, the more it catches.”</p>

<h3>The spread of threads</h3>

<p>I’ve noticed that the threading impulse is beginning to expand beyond Twitter. It’s popping up in more and more corners of the web. At Ribbonfarm, Venkatesh Rao is experimenting with a new genre called “<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/21/constructions-in-magical-thinking/">blogchains</a>,” in which a bunch of blog posts are linked together around a single theme. It’s different than a traditional series because it’s “improvised rather than planned, is responsive to salient events in the environment, evolves at a certain tempo, is structurally a way to <em>build over time</em>, is suitable for multi-author collaboration, is capable of supporting an inter-process messaging protocol with adjacent blogchains, has no necessary or scripted ‘ending.’” The blogchain seems like a direct descendant of the Twitter thread — an attempt to experiment with the medium outside the confines of Twitter’s more rigid platform.</p>

<p>At Epsilon Theory, Ben Hunt created what he calls a <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/discovery-map-december-31-2018/">Discovery Map</a>. It’s an interactive visualization that displays all 300 of his blog posts as a network graph. The nodes of the network are organized in thematic clusters. Instead of scrolling down a reverse-chronological feed, you can surf across related posts and see connections across time. This feels like a genuinely new way of interacting with blog content, and it serves as an interesting answer to the question “Where should I start?”</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/discovery-map.png"></p>

<p>The most interesting non-linear threading product I’ve discovered is called <a href="http://are.na/">Are.na</a>. It’s like Pinterest, but for nerds. Are.na lets you organize “Blocks” (text, links, photos) into thematic “Channels”. For example, I’m currently collecting material for channels called “<a href="https://www.are.na/aaron-lewis/deep-history-8mjcwnu9nia">Deep history</a>” and “<a href="https://www.are.na/aaron-lewis/culture-wars-2-0">Culture wars 2.0</a>”. Other people can easily add blocks to your channels, and you can include their channels inside your own. Channels can be rearranged, renamed, connected in novel ways. On Are.na, you’re a spider spinning a knowledge web alongside a bunch of other curious spiders. You never know how your webs might connect. I’ve started searching for things on Are.na (instead of Google) because every block lives inside a channel that’s connected to a lot of related content. Whereas a Google search result feels like a dead-end, an Arena block feels like an unexpected beginning.</p>

<p>What’s frustrating about blogging is that each post feels static and final. It’s not very alive as a medium. I wish it were easier for posts to evolve over time, sprout offshoots, find collaborators. The hyperlink is a pretty crude technology for connecting things together. Visa’s threads, Ribbonfarm’s blogchains, Epsilon Theory’s Discovery Map, and Are.na’s channels are all pointing to a model of content creation and consumption that’s more fit for the way our minds actually work. Threads are a more fluid and malleable medium. Finding someone’s thread-web feels like the digital equivalent of perusing the bookshelves in their home. You don’t have to know what you’re looking for, but you’re usually pleasantly surprised by what you find.</p>

<p>For the last few months, Visa has been replying to my tweets with links to his relevant thread-webs. Each random thought I tweet becomes a new entry point into the collection he’s been curating for years. He’d probably do this if I weren’t supporting him on Patreon, but I believe his threading experiment is an extremely valuable service. As the internet grows more complex, we’re going to need people who can string things together across time and …</p></article></section></div>

      <div><p>Facebook censorship has effectively barred my business from their platform and is materially impacting the livelihood of my customers.</p>
<p>For the past decade, Iâ€™ve run an online portfolio business on the side called <a href="https://foliohd.com/" target="_blank">FolioHD</a>. (You get a subdomain on the platform to host your portfolio, like mine at <a href="http://watilo.foliohd.com/">watilo.foliohd.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have no insight into the offending content, and the offending content can be anything from a nippleÂ&nbsp;to now apparently <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/23/project-veritas-facebook-sting-moderators-brag-abo/" target="_blank">even a MAGA hat</a>.</p>
<p>Now I am personally blocked on Instagram from liking photos or sending DMs. I canâ€™t sign into my company Instagram account. And Facebook has reached into my Pageâ€™s support inbox and removed private message between myself and customers.<br></p><p><b>How I noticed</b></p><p>A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through my personal Instagram and double-tapped a photo. Instead of seeing a red heart, I received this message.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3509ecd9-6aeb-4004-b042-0d782cec404c/Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171501Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=534498c02cd6adf24abad8b4848915ab86e2fc90c2bc390e986a256de8d3e10f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png%22" title="Image: https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3509ecd9-6aeb-4004-b042-0d782cec404c/Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171501Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=534498c02cd6adf24abad8b4848915ab86e2fc90c2bc390e986a256de8d3e10f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png%22"><br></p><p>Tapping â€œTell usâ€� simply says, â€œThanks for reporting this issue.â€�</p>

<p>Any social posts created through a Buffer-style service, even using a bitly link, gets posted briefly, then removed, with no notice.</p>

<p>Now my customers can no longer share links to their websites within the Facebook ecosystem.

If a subdomain contains offending content, it shouldnâ€™t poison the root domain and every other subdomain.</p>
<p>And Facebook should probably never weasel their way into private company inboxes to remove content retroactively. You break the trust of any business by pulling these kind of moves. How can we rely on you for anything if your censorship is a moving target?</p>
<p>And if anyone knows how to get Facebook to fix this, please let me know. Short of filing a lawsuit, Iâ€™m not sure how to get this resolved.<br></p></div>

<p>We present a simple to use implementation of networking across ultrasonic frequencies, by making use of Gnuradio and a microphone and speakers. This allows you to use <strong>TCP/IP</strong>,<strong>UDP</strong> across an audio link.</p>



<p>In order to follow this tutorial we recommend you use the LiveDVD release of Gnuradio (which is basically a Ubuntu distribution, with gnuradio already installed). This is easily downloadable from <a href="https://gnuradio.org/redmine/news/31">http://gnuradio.org/redmine/news/31</a>. First of all you will need to download the patch we made to Gnuradio, to a USB stick. You can download the patch from <a href="https://github.com/anfractuosity/ultrasonicnetworking/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/anfractuosity/ultrasonicnetworking/archive/master.zip</a>. In order to use the patch, you need to be root, so type <strong>‘sudo bash’</strong>, then unzip the patch, and simply run setup.sh, by typing <strong>./setup.sh</strong>. The setup file simply patches the Gnuradio packet encoder and decoder, in order to support variable length packets.</p>



<p>After running <strong>setup.py</strong>, you can then initialise Gnuradio, which you need to run as root, so do <strong>sudo gnuradio-companion</strong>. And then load a.grc on your first laptop.</p>



<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> depicts our graph which enables us to perform the ultrasonic networking. We will now describe how the graph functions through each block. The first block in the top left, is the TUNTAP PDU, this allows you to create a virtual network interface, through which we can send and receive packets.</p>



<p>We use the “PDU to tagged Stream” block to convert the packets received from the virtual NIC, into a byte stream for the packet encoder to process. We can’t directly attach the output of the tagged stream to the GFSK modulator, as we need to add a checksum, through the use of CRC and also we need to add a preamble and header onto the packet – this is all achieved through the use of the packet encoder.</p>



<p>A preamble is essentially a series of bits, which can be detected at the receiver end, in order to correctly align bits, to the correct byte boundaries. The packet encoder, also adds a header after the preamble, which states how long the packet is, in bytes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1-1024x558.png" alt="Screenshot" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1-1024x558.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1-300x163.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 1</strong><br></p>



<p>The GFSK modulator essentially performs Frequency Shift Keying modulation. As you can see in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, the frequency of the modulated signal is lower, when a ‘0’ is being sent, than a ‘1’ being sent. We found that in the context of ultrasonic networking using laptops and microphones, that FSK performed better than PSK (Phase Shift Keying – which uses phase changes, to communicate bits), which is another modulation technique.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk.png" alt="fsk" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk.png 533w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 2 (courtesy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fsk.svg">wikipedia</a>)</strong></p>



<p>A very important aspect of the GFSK block is the number of Samples/Symbol. We set this to a value of 9. This means that for each symbol received by the modulator, 9 samples are generated. The higher this number the more resilient the signal is to noise, but consequentially the lower the baud rate (which essentially means the longer it takes to send packets).<br>Baud rate refers to the number of symbols which are transferred per second.</p>



<p>We then use the rational resampler block, to make the signal further resilient. For every sample in, it generates 320 out.</p>



<p>We use a frequency-translating FIR filter, to translate the frequency of the incoming signal. We shift the signal by -carrier_tx, which is -19kHz in this example. This is so that the signal is just outside of the human range of hearing.</p>



<p>As we have been working with complex signals at this point, we need to convert the complex output into a floating point output for the audio card, we achieve this through the use of a ‘Complex to Real’ block.</p>



<p>The bottom part of the graph, depicts the receiver section of the program. It essentially performs the same functions, but in reverse.<br>However there are two additional blocks after the ‘Float to complex’ block. The multiply const block, allows you to multiply the output from the microphone by a fixed number. The block after this is a bandpass filter, to only allow a small range of frequencies to pass through to the demodulator, this helps remove a large amount of noise which is present from the microphone’s output.</p>



<p>In <strong>Figure 3</strong>, you will see that there are two graphs. The top graph, depicts the output sent to the transmitter and the bottom graph depicts the input received from the microphone (after a bandpass filter has mean applied to it). There is also a slider present at the top which allows you to multiply the signal from the microphone by a specific value. This is useful when using 2 laptops which are a greater distance away from each other.</p>

<p><strong>Fig. 3</strong><br></p>







<p>Figure 4 depicts the full duplex signalling we use. You can see that we transmit in this example at two different frequencies, 19kHz and 18kHz. This allows both laptops to send their own signal simultaneously.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/clip.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/clip.png" alt="clip"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 4</strong><br></p>







<p>In Gnuradio-companion, you will need to go to Build &gt; Execute, in order to execute the graph. You then need to assign an IP address to the tap0 interface it creates for you. You need to do this through a terminal, typing <strong>sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.1.10</strong> for instance.</p>



<p>You need to perform the same steps on your second laptop, B, but instead this time loading b.grc, and using <strong>sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.1.20</strong>.</p>



<p>We found it was best to assign ARP entries manually to each laptop. In order to assign an ARP entry, on laptop A, <strong>arp -s 192.168.1.20 &lt;Laptop B’s MAC address for tap0&gt; -i tap0</strong></p>



<p>The setup script, which you have initialised on both laptops copied the patched files to Gnuradio, as well as modifying TCP options, in order to allow TCP/IP to work across a very laggy network.</p>


<pre title="">echo 100 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries
echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies
echo 100 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_synack_retries
</pre>


<p>The first line is necessary in order to enable a client side TCP connection to stay open longer than the default of 20 seconds, before closing.</p>







<p>In order to test the network is functioning correctly we recommend using netcat. To test out TCP/IP connectivity Use <strong>netcat -vv -l 10000</strong> on Laptop A, and connect to it from Laptop B, using <strong>netcat -vv 192.168.1.10 10000</strong>. Because we are using the verbose options, netcat will inform you when a connection to Laptop A has been established, you can then send text from either laptop to the other one.</p>







<p>As the packet encoder and decoder provided by Gnuradio only work with fixed amounts of data, it was necessary to modify them to support the reading of stream tags. The “PDU to tagged stream” tags packets from the tap interface with their size. The packet encoder/decoder can’t process these tags normally, so we altered the packet encoder, to read these tags, and generate the appropriate sized packet from the tap0 frame. The packet decoder, then unencapsulates the packet, and tags the resulting data, with its size.</p>

<p>If anyone’s got any suggestions for improvements to the Gnuradio patch I’d be most appreciative (the patch itself was done very quickly).</p>

<p>Minimodem looks like a great program, but as far as I’m aware it supports only FSK. I was keen to try different modulation schemes, which Gnuradio provides many of; I originally tried the setup with PSK.</p>



<p>Also this provided me with an introduction into how some of the techniques used for Software Defined Radio work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>A digital feed is an online stream of content which gets updated as new content is pushed by the feed’s sources. Generally, content is created by users on the social media platform, to be consumed by their followers.</p>
<p>All popular social media platforms feature some type of feed: Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook. Operators of these platforms benefit from increased engagement by their users, so they employ techniques designed to achieve that end. Unfortunately, they often do so at the expense of their users’ well-being. Below are 7 rules to help you retain control over your screen time, without having to leave social media for good, ordered from most important to least important.</p>
<h2 id="rule-1-avoid-non-chronological-feeds">Rule #1: Avoid non-chronological feeds</h2>
<p>On most online platforms, the order of content is determined by an algorithm designed to maximize user engagement, i.e. addict you and keep you looking at ads for as long as possible. Examples: Facebook news feed, Twitter “top tweets”, Instagram explore tab, Tiktok.</p>

<p>Your phone is always within your reach. Access feeds only on your laptop, in order not to condition yourself to constantly check it. Don’t install social media or video apps on your phone.</p>
<h2 id="rule-3-follow-with-purpose">Rule #3: Follow with purpose</h2>
<p>Your digital experience changes with each new person/source you follow. Be mindful about the utility of the information you would obtain before following a new source.</p>
<h2 id="rule-4-limit-the-number-of-peoplethings-you-follow">Rule #4: Limit the number of people/things you follow</h2>
<p>The amount of content you will have to go through increases roughly linearly with the number of sources you follow. You probably won’t see everything your 500 followees share—maybe it’s time to unfollow some of them.</p>
<h2 id="rule-5-schedule-and-limit-your-exposure">Rule #5: Schedule and limit your exposure</h2>
<p>Your brain has a limited capacity to process and hold information. Schedule a certain hour of the day to receive it, and don’t surpass it. Example: No more than 30 minutes of social media, restricted to 10–11 am.</p>
<h2 id="rule-6-block-generously-and-ruthlessly">Rule #6: Block generously and ruthlessly</h2>
<p>If you don’t like what you’re seeing, block or unfollow <em>immediately</em>. This is the hardest when someone posts content that is sometimes useful, but otherwise annoying too. Generally, we put up with it for too long until we block someone.</p>
<h2 id="rule-7-mute-words">Rule #7: Mute words</h2>
<p>Avoid toxic memes by muting related words, e.g. Trump, ISIS. This will filter out any post that contains that word. Click <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/muted_keywords">here</a> to do it on Twitter now—it’s easy.</p>
<p>Follow these simple set of rules, and restore your control over social media and your digital experience in no time.</p>

<p><span>Initial publication: June 27, 2020</span></p><hr>

<p>
	I've <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previously discussed</a> how the PlayStation 2 doesn't have any good entry-point software exploits for launching homebrew. You need to either purchase a memory card with an exploit pre-installed (or a memory card to USB adapter), a HDD expansion bay (not available to slim consoles), open up the console to block the disc tray sensors, or install a modchip. For the best selling console of all time, it deserves better hacks.
</p>

<p>
	My initial attempt to solve this problem was to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">exploit the BASIC interpreter</a> that came bundeld with early PAL region PS2s. Although I was successful at producing the first software based entry-point exploit that can be triggered using only hardware that came with the console, the attack was largely criticized due to the requirement of having to enter the payload manually through the controller or keyboard, and limitation of being PAL only. I decided to write-off that exploit as being impractical, and so the hunt continued for a better attack scenario for the PlayStation 2.
</p>

<p>
	The PlayStation 2 has other sources of untrusted input that we could attack; games which support online multiplayer or USB storage could almost definitely be exploited. But unlike say the Nintendo 64, where we don't really have any other choice but to resort to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/shogihax.html">exploiting games over interfaces like modems</a>, the PlayStation 2 has one key difference: its primary input is optical media (CD / DVD discs), a format which anyone can easily burn with readily available consumer hardware. This leaves an interesting question which I've wanted to solve since I was a child:
</p>

<p>
	Is it possible to just burn our own homebrew games and launch them on an unmodified console the same way we would launch official discs (without going through any user interaction like disc swapping or triggering a network exploit in a game)?
</p>



<p>
	Ultimately, I was successfully able to achieve my goal by exploiting the console's DVD player functionality. This blog post will describe the technical details and process of reversing and exploiting the DVD player. Loading <a href="#backup">backups of commercial games is also possible</a>. All of my code is <a href="https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot">available on GitHub</a>.
</p>

</p>

<br>

<h2>DVD video player attack surface</h2>
<p>
	Obviously we can't just burn a disc containing an ELF file and expect the PS2 to boot it; we'll need to exploit some kind of software vulnerability related to parsing of controlled data. The console supports playing burned DVD video discs, which exposes significant attack surface we could potentially exploit to achieve our goal.
</p>

<p>
	If we think about what a DVD Video consists of there are quite a few main components, each with the potential for vulnerabilities:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>UDF filesystem</li>
	<li>DVD Video metadata / subtitles</li>
	<li>Audio and video decoding</li>
	<li>Interaction machine</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Whilst the complete DVD Video specification is unfortunately behind a paywall, it is comprised largely of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Video_data">open formats like MPEG</a>, just bundled together in a proprietary container format (VOB). For the proprietary aspects there are some freely accessible unofficial references.
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format is probably the simplest format used, and is responsible for storing the metadata that links the video files together.
</p>

<p>
	The interaction machine is what allows for interactive menus and games in DVD Videos. It has <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Inside_DVD-Video/Instruction_Set_Details">32 groups of instructions</a>, and is interesting because it could potentially be used to dynamically manipulate internal memory state to prime an exploit, or it could be used to create a universal DVD with a menu which allows you to select your firmware version and trigger the appropriate exploit.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
	Clearly it's not practical to do most of our testing on the real hardware since burning hundreds of test discs would be wasteful and time inefficient. We need an emulator with some debugger support, which is where we hit our first roadblock: the most popular emulator for PlayStation 2, PCSX2, <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/1981">does not support playing DVD Videos</a>, and no one is interested in adding support.
</p>

<p>
	I'd like to thank krHacken for helping me out with that first roadblock. It turns out that PCSX2 does support the DVD player; it just can't load it automatically since it's located in encrypted storage and PCSX2 does not support the decryption. There are public tools which can <a href="https://github.com/xfwcfw/kelftool">decrypt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jimmikaelkael/eromdir">extract</a> the DVD player from EROM storage. It can then be repacked into an ELF for easy loading into PCSX2.
</p>

<p>
	Due to the large number of different PlayStation 2 models released, each with slightly different DVD player firmwares (&gt; 50...), I will focus on a single DVD player for the duration of this article: 3.10E (configured with English language in PS2 settings), as it happens to be the firmware for the console I own. Update: apparently the 3.10E exploit described here works on 3.10U console with no changes.
</p>

<p>
	I will continue to use Ghidra for decompilation as I've been using throughout my <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previous</a> articles. The DVD player does not contain any symbols so all names in code snippets were assigned by me through reverse engineering.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Disc controlled data</h2>
<p>
	The first file a DVD player will attempt to read is <code>VIDEO_TS.IFO</code>. Searching memory for contents of the file and then setting memory write breakpoints there to track back where it was written we quickly locate the API that reads disc contents used by the IFO parsing code, <code>getDiscByte</code> at <code>0x25c920</code>. It's a stream reader which caches a number of sectors into a RAM buffer, and then automatically seeks more data once needed:
</p>

<pre><code>byte getDiscByte(void) {
	byte ret;
	
	if (currentDiscBytePointer &lt; endDiscBytePointer) {
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	else {
		currentDiscBytePointer = &amp;buffer;
		setOffset = setOffset + numberOfSectorsRead;
		getDiscByteInternal();
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	currentDiscBytePointer = currentDiscBytePointer + 1;
	return ret;
}
</code></pre>



<p>
	From searching calls to this, we can also quickly find wrappers that fetch data of larger sizes: <code>getDiscU16</code> (<code>0x25c980</code>), <code>getDiscU32</code> (<code>0x25c9b8</code>), and <code>getDiscData</code> (<code>0x25c9f0</code>), which is the most interesting as it reads an arbitrary length of data:
</p>

<pre><code>void getDiscData(uint size, byte *destination) {
	byte b;
	uint i;
	
	i = 0;
	if (size != 0) {
		do {
			i = i + 1;
			b = getDiscByte();
			*destination = b;
			destination = destination + 1;
		} while (i &lt; size);
	}
	return;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Large reads</h2>
<p>
	The first thing I did was search for calls to <code>getDiscData</code> in the hope of finding one with controllable size, and no bounds checking.
</p>

<p>
	Sure enough, we very quickly identify about 4 blatant buffer overflow vulnerabilities of this nature. Relating back to the <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format, we can see that there are numerous 16-bit array lengths which are needed to parse the variably sized data structures in the file. The DVD player mistakenly only ever expects the maximum lengths allowed by the DVD specification, and so it is missing checks to reject discs with larger lengths. Since all of the copies are done on statically allocated memory buffers, specifying larger than allowed lengths will cause buffer overflows. For example, below is decompilation for the one at <code>0x25b3bc</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>		large1 = getDiscU16();
		large2 = getDiscU16();
		large3 = getDiscU16();
		ignored = getDiscU16();
		getDiscData(((uint)large1 + (uint)large2 + (uint)large3) * 8, &amp;DAT_0140bdd4);</code></pre>



<p>
	This one is the most interesting because it allows the largest possible copy size (<code>0xffff * 3 * 8 = 0x17FFE8</code> bytes) of all the <code>getDiscData</code> buffer overflows. It copies into the statically allocated buffer at <code>0x0140bdd4</code>, and so by specifying the maximum possible copy size we gain control over the address space from <code>0x140bdd4</code> to <code>0x158BDBC</code> (<code>0x140bdd4 + 0x17FFE8</code>).
</p>

<br>

<h2>Corruption from the large reads</h2>
<p>
	As you can see, we can control quite a large region of memory using the above vulnerability. However, scanning through that memory is initially very disappointing; there are very few pointers, and none of them look particularly interesting to corrupt!
</p>

<p>
	Although there are no interesting pointers in this region, there are some indexes, which if corrupted could lead to further out of bounds memory corruption.
</p>

<p>
	Note that large reads like this won't always copy contiguous data from the IFO file, as sectors will start repeating once we exceed the file size, but generally assume that all data written by a <code>getDiscData</code> call can be controlled as it originates from <i>somewhere</i> on the disc. Also, after writing a certain amount, we may overflow into internal state used by <code>getDiscByte</code> functions, but we will get to this later.
</p>

<br>

<h3>OOB call</h3>
<p>
	At <code>0x25e388</code> we have this call to an entry in a function pointer array, where we can control the 16-bit <code>fpIndex</code> at <code>0x141284a</code> from the overflow:
</p>

<pre><code>(*(code *)(&amp;PTR_LAB_005b9d40)[(uint)fpIndex])(puVar6 + ((uint)DAT_01412841 - 1) * 8);</code></pre>



<p>
	This allows us to jump to the address stored anywhere from <code>0x5b9d40</code> up to <code>0x5b9d40 + 0xffff * 4 = 0x5F9D3C</code>.
</p>

<br>

<h4>Exploiting OOB call</h4>
<p>
	This primitive is not quite ideal, as none of our overflow bugs allow us to control the memory where the jump targets are read from. Worse still, most of this memory region is mapped from a read-only section of the DVD Player, so it's unlikely that we can influence the contents of this memory region without another bug.
</p>

<p>
	After the function pointers, we do some see some addresses for <code>switch</code> <code>case</code> labels, which is slightly interesting because that allows us to jump into the middle of a function and execute its epilogue without having executed its prologue, allowing us to misalign the stack pointer and return to an unexpected value on the stack. I went through all of these and unfortunately I was only ever able to use that to jump to <code>0</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Finally after the code pointers, we see read only string data. Interestingly, this data can be changed by switching languages in the PS2 menu, which gives greater hope for finding at least 1 usable jump target in every firmware version, however it unfortunately comes at the cost of forcing the user to reconfigure their language.
</p>

<p>
	I decided to …</p></div></div></div>

<p><a href="https://jiahai-feng.github.io/posts/cache-oblivious-algorithms/" title="Cache Oblivious Algorithms">
        <img src="">
    </a>
</p>



    
<p>Cache-oblivious algorithms seemed incredible to me when I first heard about it in 6.854 (Advanced Algorithms). It’s relatively straightforward to imagine algorithms that utilizes information about page size $B$ and cache size $M$ to create efficient data structures. However, cache-oblivious algorithms are algorithms that achieve similar efficiencies <em>without knowing $B$ or $M$</em>. That means the same cache-oblivious algorithm can be ran on computers with different cache or page sizes and still achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as one that is tailored to that specific cache. The key to many of these algorithms is a recursive, fractal-like idea. I’ll describe a cache-oblivious algorithm for searching in a list of integers.</p>

<p>Here’s the set up. (TLDR at bottom) A program executes on the processor, but the input data resides on the disk. We can think of a disk as a really long linear array of data, but accessing it is really expensive. So, we instead invent this notion of a cache - a layer of memory of $M$ bits that is much smaller, but a lot faster to read/write to. For performance reasons, we will divide the disk and cache into blocks of $B$ bits, called pages, and we will transfer data between cache and disk a page at a time.</p>
<p>This cache sits between the processor and the disk, and the processor will never directly read or write to the disk. When the processor wants to read a piece of data that is not on the cache (this is called a cache miss), it will trigger some mechanism that copies the relevant page from the disk to the cache first, <em>evicting another page if the cache is full</em>, and then read from the cache.</p>
<p>How might this help? Well, trivially, if the entire set of data that the program needs fits in the cache, conceivably the processor could have fetched it all in the cache, paid the one-off cost, and then for the rest of the program the processor will never have to pay the expensive cost of reading from disk. Of course most programs require more data than that, and so we want to design algorithms that minimize cache misses.</p>
<h2 id="cache-management">Cache management</h2>
<p>However, the way computers are set up restricts the tools we have to achieve this. Programs executing on the processor have no explicit control over the cache. Instead, conceptually, programs continue to send read and write requests to the disk as though there is no cache. The processor intercepts these requests, and performs the necessary cache operations to serve the information. In other words, the cache is transparent to programs.  Thus, the task of reducing cache misses decomposes into two orthogonal components: writing efficient algorithms by cleverly ordering or specifying memory accesses, and efficient cache management.</p>
<p>For example, an efficient algorithm might try to shuffle memory accesses around so that memory accesses to a particular memory address are clumped together, increasing the likelihood that there will be a cache hit. In fact, because of the paging system, it would doubly help if memory accesses to the same <em>spatial region</em> are clumped together, because there’s a chance they’ll be on the same page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, efficient cache management entails trying to predict which piece of data to evict from the cache when there is a cache miss and we want to load more data into an already full cache. Since we’re focusing on the algorithm this article, we assume that the cache manager has magic oracle powers that lets it discard <em>optimally</em>, so from the algorithm design standpoint, if there exists a sequence of cache loads/writes that achieves our desired performance, we assume that the cache manager will do it. It turns out that this is not unreasonable, because simple techniques such as the Least Recently Used algorithm work <em>really</em> well. (An exposition on this deserves its own article.)</p>
<p>To summarize, the components of the external memory model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disk, effectively unbounded in size, stores data in pages of size $B$</li>
<li>Cache, stores $M/B$ pages, each page has size $B$</li>
<li>Processor executes algorithm, also manages cache.</li>
<li>Algorithm runs on the processor. When data is needed, the processor transparently loads the required page into the cache if there’s a cache miss, or serve the cached data if there isn’t</li>
</ul>
<p>There are efficient algorithms that require explicit knowledge of $B$ and $M$, and there cache-oblivous algorithms that are just as efficient, but some how do not. That is to say, the algorithm performs the same actions and requests the same sequence of memory accesses, that works efficiently no matter what size $B$ and $M$ really are. We’ll take a close look at the latter here.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to scan through a list of $N$ integers, to do some task, say finding the maximum. If the list occupy a contiguous block of memory on the disk, this can be done efficiently by loading pages one at a time, and scanning through the page before loading the next page. This thus takes $O(N/B)$ disk accesses, and is quite clearly optimal.</p>
<p>Suppose the algorithm does not know $B$. It can achieve the same efficiency by simply reading the elements of the list in order. The CPU will then fetch the first page to the cache, containing elements $0$ to $B-1$ and pass it to the program, and then when the program requires element $B$, it’ll read in the next page, which contains elements $B$ to $2B-1$, possibly overwriting the earlier page. This will just continue until all $N/B$ pages are read. This is cache-oblivious, because the algorithm of sequentially reading the elements is the same regardless of what $B$ is.</p>
<p>Note that in this example, it is essential that the list is stored in a contiguous block of memory. Had the elements been scattered around like in a linked-list, each access could potentially trigger a cache miss, since there’s no guarantee that neighboring elements will be on the same page. This may seem obvious, but this is the main mechanism by which we can write efficient algorithms - coming up with efficient layouts of data.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the problem of searching for an integer in a list. We’ll examine three ways of doing this.</p>
<h2 id="inefficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-binary-search">Inefficient cache-oblivious algorithm: Binary search</h2>
<p>Let’s assume the data is sorted in a list, and packed contiguously on the disk. A possible algorithm is then to perform binary search, which typically takes $O(\log N)$ reads. The binary search can be viewed a successively narrowing an interval in which the query value may reside in. However, once the interval that the binary search is narrowing is $O(B)$, the entire interval may reside in a page, and no further page accesses are required. Thus, we require only $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. Notice that this is a cache-oblivious algorithm because the algorithm doesn’t know what $B$ is - to the algorithm, it’s just running a standard binary search.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-but-not-cache-oblivious-b-trees">Efficient, but not cache-oblivious: B-trees</h2>
<p>Suppose we know $B$ ahead of time. We can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses. We arrange the list in the format of a B-tree, a generalized BST. Similar to a BST, each subtree of a B-tree corresponds to a contiguous subset of the elements of the list when sorted by value. However, each node $V$ of the tree contains not one, but $B$ elements, which splits the interval corresponding to the subtree rooted at node $V$ into not 2, but $B+1$ intervals. Then, we can traverse down the BST, and each time we go down one level we reduce the interval by a factor of $B$. This thus requires only $O(\log_B N) = O(\log N / \log B)$ page accesses. In reality of course, we have to store pointers and possibly other metadata in each node, so we can’t have exactly $B$ elements in each node, but we can definitely split by $\Theta(B)$ each level.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-van-emde-boas-layout">Efficient cache-oblivious algorithm: van Emde Boas layout</h2>
<p>Now we come to the exciting part. We claim that we can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses, but without having to know $B$ ahead of time. The data structure we’re using is a good old balanced Binary Search Tree. However, the order in which we store the nodes in memory matters. If we pack the the BST in a regular fashion, say in breadth-first order, we could potentially have a situation where almost every vertex in a BST search path, except for the first few, lies in a different page, and thus we’ll have to use $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. The van Embde Boas layout is basically a clever way of ordering the vertices of a binary search tree in a recursive, fractal-like manner such that each page access will fetch the next few vertices that will be queried, so that the next few accesses will be contained within that page.</p>

</figure>

<p>For convenience, suppose the binary tree is complete and has height $H=2^K$. The layout is a permutation of the vertices of the binary tree. Denote $T(x, k)$ as the subtree of height $2^k$, rooted at vertex $x$. If the subtree at $x$ is deeper than $2^k$, then $T(x,k)$ will be the subtree truncated to the required depth. Denote $L(x, k)$ as the layout for that subtree. Then, for some root vertex $x$, of a (sub-)tree with height $h=2^k$, $L(x, k)$ is defined recursively as:</p>
<p>$$L(x, k) = L(x, k-1) \circ L(l_1, k-1) \circ L(l_2, k-1) \circ \dots \circ L(l_{n}, k-1)$$</p>
<p>Where, $l_1, \dots, l_{n}$ are the $n=2^{h/2}$ children of the leaves of $T(x, k-1)$, and $\circ$ is just concatenation. One application of this recursion is shown above.</p>
<h3 id="visual-sketch">Visual sketch</h3>
<p>If you didn’t catch that, don’t worry about it. Here’s a walkthrough. Suppose we’re given a complete binary tree of height $h=2^k$, rooted at $x$. We want to compute $L(x, k)$, which is a permutation of the vertices in this binary tree. Here’s how it’s done:</p>

<li>Cut all the edges between the $2^{k-1}$-th and $2^{k-1}+1$-th layer. This gives us:

<li>$2^{h/2}$ smaller BSTs with height $2^{k-1}$. These are the children subtrees now disconnected from the main subtree, …</li></ul></li></ol></article></div>

You’re wondering what web development interview questions the interviewer is going to fire off at you. Your mind is playing on your nerves. Tension rising notch by notch. “Am I really ready for that coding interview?” — you start beating yourself up.</p><p id="dd5e">You check your phone — it’s 3:05 pm. No missed calls. Nothing.</p><p id="f93c">You anxiously recheck your phone — 3:15 pm… still nothing.</p><p id="4c5c">You are already 30 minutes under pressure, sweating and silently moaning — your heart races. The latent impostor syndrome arises from the depths. You start freaking out… wondering whether or not you’ve given the wrong phone number… or if they might have forgotten about you.</p><p id="5e62">Your mind is leading a furious battle to overcome your anxious trains of thought. You, filled with a desperate hope, grab your phone with your sweaty pawl and look at it for one last time… and then… it rings.</p><p id="845c">You pick up and say, “Hello,” trying to hide the trembling notes in your voice, the anxious quiver of your lips and fingers, while battling the excruciating jittery inside your mind. You introduce each other and then… kinds of interview questions for web developers thrown at you, catching you off guard, that you can barely give an adequate answer to.</p><p id="d227">You realize that you are completely f*cked up. The overwhelming anxiety is growing deeper and deeper in you. You feel like you have a 200-kg bench press on your chest that you can’t lift. Vertigo comes along, and you suddenly forget. You forget your location, the person you are talking to… everything. Hands so sweaty that you just can’t hold your phone without it slipping through your fingers.</p><p id="a240">You know that the chances of making a good impression are so damn low that you’d have more luck if you were to bet on racing cockroaches.</p><p id="262a">To avoid that, you need strong preparation for the next coding interview. You need to have a grasp of the interview questions for web developers you are being asked. That will boost your confidence and diminish the anxiety before the phone or onsite interview.</p><p id="ab34">In this article, I’ll talk about the principles behind the developer interview process — the most common web developer questions you can expect from interviewers and how to answer them in a fascinating way that will put a WOW expression on their faces (even if they want to rip your head off, rearrange your face, or just clean their shoes ;-) ).</p><p id="a90c">To start off, you need to realize that the web dev interviewing process is more like a negotiation. You’ve been probably taught as a kid that you need to be flawless during interviews and answer every question accurately to make a good impression and get hired.</p><p id="b625">This couldn’t be further from the truth (coming from someone who got hired by sending out a cold message directly to their employer — no official nor traditional interview process).</p><p id="e763">Yes, of course, you need to make a good impression. But if you think that making a good impression comes down to awkwardly staring at your interviewer, frozen, while answering every developer interview question like a robot… you’re highly mistaken my friend.</p><p id="804e">You need to be able to communicate with your future employer freely while at the same time exuding confidence, knowledge, curiosity, and most importantly, enthusiasm.</p><p id="e9be">Here are the main things employers look for when hiring people:</p><ol><li id="c9d8"><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Have-a-Great-Personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personality</a>.</li><li id="bc1a"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/whats-the-difference-between-a-programmer-coder-developer-and-engineer-bd315404de7">Basic qualifications</a>.</li><li id="5b8b"><a href="http://breathehr.com/blog/what-is-cultural-fit-and-why-is-it-important" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture fit</a>.</li><li id="e3a7"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/how-to-become-a-10x-engineer-492fa3f57101">Enthusiasm</a>.</li></ol><p id="c68d">You need to have a fitting personality, meaning, you need to be able to easily communicate with your team without any hassle whatsoever. You need to ask clear and concise questions while at the same time, giving thorough and detailed answers.</p><p id="51b8">Of course, you also need to possess basic qualifications for the job you are applying for. Yet, many people seem to put tons of attention to that one (which is perfectly fine), but it’s just ¼ of the whole equation.</p><p id="61d9">Culture fit — this ties back into your personality. You have to be able to sync with your team and develop a culture that everyone enjoys working in.</p><p id="147b">And finally, have a burning passion and enthusiasm for your job. You’ll be surprised how helpful enthusiasm can be.</p><p id="eee3">For example, you may not have as good a resume as the guy in the next room that’s also being interviewed… but if you display a burning enthusiasm and willingness to go out of your way, you can beat other candidates and win the job. Of course, that may not always be the case. Still, it’s much more likely for an employer to hire you as a hyper enthusiastic person than as an average employee.</p><p id="2cb1">Alright, let’s take a look at some of the most common web developer interview questions (and answers) you may encounter. We’ll first start with professional software engineer behavioral questions and then switch over to more technical questions.</p><p id="6540">Whether you are a front-end, back-end, or full-stack software developer, these common computer science interview questions will help you in your preparation for the next coding interview.</p><p id="0f2d">NOTE: Some of the behavioral questions can also be noticed in web design interviews. So if you are a web designer, this article will highly prepare you for the next web design interview.</p><p id="53af">Most interviewers start off with introductory questions. Just follow the common sense when answering these software engineer interview questions. Try to be as transparent as possible. Tell them what really sparked your interest in coding and why you applied for this job.</p><p id="9720">If you are applying for an entry-level web developer job, interviewers won’t expect years of experience (they may even skip that question) as you’ve probably just graduated or finished a coding boot camp. Yet, if you are applying for a senior software engineer position, you need to have years of experience to back up your application for that web development job.</p><p id="ed12">You need to get familiar with Agile frameworks such as Kanban and Scrum because nowadays companies are adopting Agile practices and moving away from Waterfall methodologies. Interviewers may also ask you questions about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/software-development-life-cycle-the-ultimate-guide-2020-153d17bb20fb">SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) process</a>.</p><p id="3aa1">As simple as that. You might want to focus on the specific languages that your web development job will require you to use most frequently.</p><p id="b2b4">Lately, having experience with multiple languages like C++, Java, and Python will definitely widen your interviewer’s eyes in astonishment.</p><p id="588b"><em>Credits to Andrew Mallonee, CEO at </em><a href="https://malloneemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Mallonee Media</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="0286">Be transparent and give a thorough explanation.. Sometimes, the interviewer might follow up with, “Do you get excited by using these languages?” but rarely. Obviously, reply with Yes and explain why you feel excited.</p><p id="fb59">It’s more of a soft skill interview question. Software engineering is a job in which you need to always thrive and sharpen your skills. Employers need to know that their developers are on the cutting edge using the latest technologies and constantly honing their skills. So, the answer to that software developer interview question would obviously be “Yes” — but expand further by telling them what interests you the most when it comes to learning new coding skills.</p><p id="14d6">Talk about projects similar to the projects you are going to be working on in the position you are applying for. If not, be genuine (always) and tell them what really sparks your passion for software development.</p><p id="e2fd">Here, interviewers particularly want to hear about severe problems, not many people on your team were able to solve, yet you were. Something important to remember is not to try to impress the interviewer — the scales will fall from his eyes immediately. Instead of making a good impression, you’ll make a desperate one. Be casual when talking about the problem that no one was able to solve except you. You, thus, exude confidence and knowledge. Being humble in the answer of this web dev interview question is key.</p><p id="6399">Another soft skill interview question. Life is about learning from your mistakes. Be as transparent as possible and openly admit the mistakes you’ve made in the past. Talk about the lessons you’ve learned. Basically, explain how you coped with your worst failures and came out stronger.</p><p id="bf9b">Research a lot prior to the interview. Go through all of their social media profiles to find little nuggets of information that would impress your interviewer. Show passion and enthusiasm for the company. Enthusiasm plays a huge role in the interview process.</p><p id="7b49">Same as previous — conduct thorough research and analysis before the interview. Show passion and enthusiasm. Tell the interviewer why you would love to work on those particular projects. They can thus see the reason behind that enthusiasm and wind out the thoughts of all that being a mere fluff.</p><p id="b2c0">These web development interview questions can happen over the phone or onsite.</p><p id="e12a">The following technical interview questions typically happen onsite, but sometimes they can take place remotely. If it’s remotely, the interviewer will ask you to share your screen to watch over your shoulder while you are coding and at the same time answering software development interview questions.</p><p id="c6ea">Keep in mind that the technical questions you are being asked highly depend on the position you are applying for. We’ll try to cover some of the most common software developer interview questions and give you reasonable answers that you can adjust to your situation easily.</p><p id="699b"><em>Credits to Michael Miller, CEO at </em><a href="https://vpnonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>VPN Online</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="fc04">There are lots of ways you can write your code, and all of them are correct. The company you want to join probably has a set standard for writing code and will perhaps compare your answer to that standard. Usually, most companies look for developers who take the simplest approach to code and try to weep out those who praise the sophisticated way of coding. That’s because companies want to easily maintain and document their code.</p><p id="3b99">Java developer interview questions are quite common. When interviewers ask you …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>The aim of this project was to display a colour image on a black and white monitor, by overlaying an acetate bayer filter over the monitor and mosaicing a colour image.</p>



<p>I obtained an Eizo B&amp;W monitor from ebay, which I was intending for use viewing B&amp;W photos and was curious if I could replicate an effect similar to <strong>Autochrome Lumière</strong> ( see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochrome_Lumi%C3%A8re">wikipedia</a> ) where they overlay colour filters over a B&amp;W photographic plate, using starch grains, which creates a colour image.</p>



<p>The following image shows a 500x microscope image of the pixels that make up the B&amp;W LCD display, taken using a very cheap USB microscope.  It looks to me as if each pixel, is represented by 4 sub-pixel elements, please correct me if this appears not be the case.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>A pdf was created of the bayer display, with the dimensions 433.1mm x 324.8mm.  The monitor has a resolution of 2048×1536 and I assumed the pixels had the same width as height.</p>



<p>You can see an example of the pdf I created below, where for example a blue element, should be represented by 2×2 pixels from the B&amp;W monitor. </p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-1024x540.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-1024x540.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-300x158.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-768x405.png 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-1536x810.png 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I created 3 pdfs:</p>



<ul><li>bayer_1.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 1 pixel from the display</li><li>bayer_2.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 2×2 pixels from the display (this is the acetate used in the video)</li><li>bayer_4.pdf – each element is represented by 4×4 pixels from the display</li></ul>



<p>The following image shows the printed acetate with the bayer pattern:</p>

<p>The monitor I am using seems to generally be used portrait, to make it landscape on linux:</p>

<h2>Image of effect</h2>



<p>As you can see the effect of my attempt is quite slight, but you can see in the centre the different colours of the balloons.</p>

<h2>Video of effect</h2>



<p>The effect is also demonstrated in the following video, with the following parameters:</p>

<h2>Microscope images of the bayer filter (2×2 scaling)</h2>



<p>2×2 bayer filter, I tried to design it so that for example the ‘red’ square covers 2×2 pixels on the monitor</p>

<h2>Chess board </h2>



<p>As suggested by Olivier, I’ve just created 2 chess board images.  Olivier was correct that a single pixel consists of 3 sub-pixels 🙂</p>



<p>1×1 (the white patch is 1 pixel), monitor in landscape, image in correct orientation from microscope (left, towards left monitor, top, towards top of monitor)</p>

<h2>Possible improvements</h2>



<p>I wonder if by measuring the exact pixel width/height under a microscope, if the effect could possibly be improved somewhat, as that information could be used when creating the acetate filter.</p>



<p>Alignment is also a key issue, I need to think of ways to improve that possibly using a microscope while aligning the acetate.</p>



<p>I’d be interested in other improvements I could make too!</p>

                <p>Last year as I kicked off my career entering the professional tech world, I came across the concept of <strong>Objective, Key and Results (OKRs)</strong> at work. I was quite intrigued by the whole concept of OKRs.</p>

<p>In very layman terms —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Main objective of OKR is to plan out qualitative goals with quantitative results for those with proper time tracking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People do use diary or todo apps for tracking there work. Todo apps usually work for tracking tasks over a shorter duration. You need a framework to plan out for your bigger goal and track your progress towards it.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*bX5Vy1OPJ3LImq9DHIgU5g.png" alt="Personal OKR Header Section"></p>

<p>In this blog, I will try to explain how you can plan and why it is important to have your Personal OKR. Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<p>OKRs is already a very popular term in business, most probably it is being used at your workplace too. It is a <strong>goal-setting framework</strong> that basically covers big and challenging goals with a set of defined measurable results for achieving these goals.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective — </h3>

<ul>
  <li>What do you want to achieve over a period of time?</li>
  <li>Objectives should be ambitious, more <strong>inspirational</strong> (which requires more effort of yours), bold and <strong>qualitative</strong></li>
  <li>Your targets should not be something very easily achievable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Improve the financial condition, Get better at reading, etc</p>

<h3 id="key-results">Key Results</h3>

<ul>
  <li>KRs are steps you need to achieve the objective.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Quantitative</strong> i.e having defined metrics! This should not be vague. Add numbers, avoid terms like “more/less”.<br>
Google uses. a scale of 0–1 for tracking progress for each key result.</li>
  <li>Make KRs <strong>Time-bounded</strong>. This helps you tracking progress over the period and lets you recalibrate your tasks.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Binary</strong> i.e Complete / Incomplete</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Read 3 books on investing, Read 1500 pages monthly, etc</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="personal-vs-work-okrs">Personal vs Work OKRs?</h3>

<p>OKRs are used by both teams and individuals, though mostly in work environments. The concept of OKR is simple and works pretty effectively for personal use as well. It is super important to have separate personal and work OKRs since your work goals are different from personal life and goals.</p>

<p>In personal OKRs, you would want to track things like —</p>

<ol>
  <li>Family time</li>
  <li>Personal finance</li>
  <li>Fitness</li>
  <li>Hobbies</li>
</ol>

<p>Personal OKRs are <strong>literally personal</strong>!<br>
It varies from person to person. It’s good to look for ideas on how people use OKRs, but you should align it for your goals and aspirations which you want to achieve.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actions — and data — speak louder than words.”<br>
― <strong>John Doerr,</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/54960827"><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>OKRs help you plan your goals in a structured and planned fashion, but there is more to it! Let me explain —</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better <strong>Focus</strong> and <strong>Alignment</strong> on what you want to achieve. Since OKRs are limited, you don’t want to waste time and do stuff that doesn’t really help you achieve what you want!</li>
  <li>These give the <strong>Motivation</strong> to work towards your objectives and a sense of urgency to finish them.</li>
  <li>OKRs help in building a <strong>Habit</strong> of planning things in general and following the path to achieving them. Eg. You have an objective of getting better at reading, you start reading 30 pages daily. Now, it slowly builds into your habit to read. Next year, even if you don’t have this objective, you’ll still read :)</li>
  <li><strong>Time Tracking</strong> is super useful and important since they give a timeline for you to work and align your tasks accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics</strong> and Numbers help you visualize your progress. When you see 80% completion, you get a psychological motivation to make it 100%</li>
  <li>If you have a <strong>Public OKR</strong>, you get another source to actually work and complete your task.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘I’d rather have the objective be to go to Mars, and if we fall short, we’ll get to the moon. This is how you make moonshots. — Larry Page</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/benefits-of-okrs/">Measure what matters</a> brings a similar <strong>F.A.C.T.S</strong> showing the benefits of OKRs.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>Now, that you understand the importance of Personal OKRs and are ready to create yours, I’ll show how I personally maintain my OKRs and share resources that might be useful for you!</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>There are a lot of tools that you can use to start creating an OKR. I personally being a big fan of <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, use it to maintain my Personal OKRs. You can use anything from professional notes and trackers like <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to simple excel sheet template.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*IOarq_FgPMWWVqohXAMvHg.png" alt="OKR Tracking with Notes"></p>

<p>I usually update my OKRs monthly since I maintain a yearly OKR tracker. You can adjust it according to the timeline you are planning for.</p>

<p>I maintain different tables for each of my Objectives. In the image below</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> — Boost Knowledge</p>

<p><strong>Key Results</strong> —</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Read 20 books</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create 2 open source projects</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Time Tracking</strong> — <br>
I maintain time tracking based on which quarter of the year I want this to be completed. I do break these KRs into sub-tasks which are added to my Todolist with a specified timeline.<br>
I use <strong>EOY</strong> (End of Year) in cases when I want that KR to be worked on throughout the year.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>—</p>

<p>I set my KRs progress to one of the 5 stages. It helps me keep track of what to do next and what is already completed. I sometimes add <strong>At-Risk</strong> tag to denote that this KR is probably not happening. I already added <strong>At-Risk</strong> to my traveling KRs this year credits to corona :(</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HQJ56kvlk0-mDZiXBrptfw.png" alt="Quarter based timeframe and Status for tracking progress"></p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>  — <br>
These are basically notes/links relevant to KR which I would want to revisit when I come back to this sometime later.</p>

<h2 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid changing OKRs</strong>! It is okay to update OKRs when you achieve something or want to divert. Do not remove OKRs just because you are doing something else now, at the end of the timeframe you should know that you failed at this due to XYZ reason, and was it worth it or not?</li>
  <li>You will fail in many Key results! <strong>It is okay to fail</strong>, now you get an idea on what did you miss, how can you improve and rework accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly update your KRs status and notes</strong>, this gives you an idea of where you need to focus more in the next few days. A biweekly or monthly review is generally a good time to revisit OKRs. I set up a biweekly reminder in my calendar for this!</li>
  <li>You can <strong>add a score</strong> to each KR to make things more interesting. For the first time, I wanted to keep it simple. Do share if you use some interesting scoring :P</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid setting too many OKRs</strong> instead make the OKRs more challenging.</li>
  <li>Add links to your weekly tasks in notes sections. This helps you view how did you spend your week in the perspective of achieving your OKR results. Even add resources for specific KRs. This helps you increase your knowledge base over a period of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep it simple</strong>! Follow what you can maintain. Don’t overcomplicate :)</li>

    <p>Font rasterisation is, in the author’s opinion, one of the most
    interesting fields of computer science. If music is the subjective
    application of physics, then font rasterisation is almost
    certainly the subjective application of computer science. The
    purpose of this article is threefold: firstly, to provide an
    introduction into the various methods available to aid in the
    rasterisation process; secondly, to provide a critical analysis of
    these methods against the needs of desktop applications; and
    finally, to relate this analysis to free software.</p>

    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>Before we start exploring the various methods used in font
    rasterisation, it is important to first understand <em>why</em>
    rasterisation is so difficult. Why should rasterisation on a
    computer screen be any more complicated than on a printer? It all
    comes down to resolution. Or, more precisely, the number
    of <em>dots per inch</em> (DPI).</p>
    <p>Printers typically start at around 300 DPI, with 600 DPI not
    being uncommon. This means that for every inch (2.54cm), there are
    potentially 300+ individual dots. Fonts, however, are not measured
    in dots but instead in <em>points</em>: 1/72 of an inch. A direct
    consequence of this is that a specific font at 10pt will have the
    same <em>physical dimensions</em> irrespective of the DPI at which
    it is rasterised.</p>
    <p>Whereas printers have a relatively high DPI, computer screens
    are typically <em>assumed</em> to be at 96 DPI, over three times
    lower. Herein lies the difficulty with on-screen
    rasterisation. This is best illustrated with an example: Figure 1
    shows the letter ‘M’ in 10pt Times New Roman at 600, 300, and 96
    DPI, respectively. Looking at the figure, it is clear that 96 DPI
    is not sufficient to preserve the shape—or letter-form—of the
    glyph.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="137" height="55" alt="M at a low DPI" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/m-various-dpi.png"></p><p>Figure 1: How 10pt Times Roman looks at 600, 300, and 96
      DPI.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This phenomenon can be explained using <em>information
    theory</em>. Since glyphs contain information it is possible to
    view them as a signal comprised of various frequencies. The
    Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem states that in order to
    accurately reproduce a signal, the sampling rate needs to
    be <em>at least twice the maximum frequency of the
    signal</em>. Should the sampling rate be lower than this, then
    distortions—in the form of aliasing—will be introduced. In the
    case of rasterisation, the sampling rate corresponds directly to
    the DPI of the output device.</p>
    <p>An example of aliasing as a consequence of low DPI can be seen
    in Figure 2.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="249" height="12" alt="Aliasing at a low DPI" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 2: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI. Note how some stems
      are thicker than others, and how certain features are
      under-/over-emphasised.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Since it is clear that 96 DPI is insufficient for accurate
    rasterisation, we are left with two options. The first is to find
    a way of <em>increasing the effective sampling rate</em> of the
    device, while the second is to <em>reduce the frequency of the
    glyphs to allow the use of a lower sampling rate</em>. All of the
    methods presented in this article fall into one of these two
    categories.</p>
    <h2><a name="font-hinting">Font Hinting</a></h2>
    <p>One of the oldest and mostly widely used techniques for
    improving rasterisation quality is font hinting. Also known
    as <em>grid fitting</em>, hinting involves modifying the shape of
    glyphs in order to ensure they line up with the rasterisation
    grid. By distorting the glyph so that it is aligned with the pixel
    grid, the overall frequency is reduced. An example of font hinting
    can be seen in Figure 3.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="257" height="26" alt="Un-hinted vs hinted text" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/hinting.png"></p><p>Figure 3: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI with (bottom) and
      without (top) hinting. Also note the differing widths between
      the hinted and un-hinted text.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The hinted text is much more consistent than its un-hinted
    counterpart. However, this consistency comes at the price of
    accuracy. An unavoidable consequence of warping glyphs to the
    rasterisation grid is that their dimensions change slightly. These
    small differences quickly add up over a line of text resulting in
    a visible difference—such as that seen in Figure 3. The author
    refers to this phenomenon as <em>character drift</em>.</p>
    <p>The degree of hinting required to produce consistent output is
    dependent on the DPI of the output device; low resolution devices
    require more aggressive hinting than high resolution device. One
    of the consequences of aggressive hinting—necessary as it may
    be—is character drift. At resolutions in excess of 300 DPI, it is
    possible to forego font hinting entirely.</p>
    <h3>Implementation details</h3>
    <p>Font hinting is usually achieved through one of two
    approaches. The first of these puts the font designer in control
    of the hinting process. This is the approach taken by the TrueType
    font specification—without a doubt the most widespread font
    format. In the specification, a virtual machine is used to
    instruct the rasteriser on how to go about rendering a
    glyph. This, in theory, gives designers <em>pixel level</em>
    control over how glyphs are rasterised at various
    sizes <cite><a href="#tur01a">Tur01a</a></cite>. The second
    approach is to leave hinting up to the font rasteriser—so
    called <em>auto-hinting</em>. When rendering non-TrueType
    fonts—such as those in Adobe’s Type 1 format, or those that lack
    hinting instructions—this is often the only
    option <cite><a href="#tur01a">Tur01a</a></cite>.</p>
    <p>In order for a meaningful comparison to be made between these
    approaches, it is first necessary to have an understanding of some
    of the other techniques available for improving rasterisation
    quality.</p>
    <h2><a name="anti-aliasing">Anti-aliasing</a></h2>
    <p>So far, we have been assuming that pixels are bi-level, either
    on or off, black or white. However, modern computer screens are
    capable of displaying millions of colours, including shades of
    grey. Font rasterisers are able to take advantage of this by using
    a technique called <em>anti-aliasing</em>. As the name would
    suggest, anti-aliasing is a means of avoiding the unwanted effects
    of aliasing when sampling a high-frequency signal on a
    low-frequency device. This is done by blurring the signal; its
    effect is to reduce its maximal frequency.</p>
    <p>Pixels of anti-aliased text are multi-level. That is, they can
    be black, white, or a shade of grey. The shade of a pixel depends
    on the percentage of the pixel that is <em>masked</em> by the
    glyph. This concept is neatly demonstrated in Figure 4.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="92" height="63" alt="Primitive anti-aliasing" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/g-anti-aliased.png"></p><p>Figure 4: The letter ‘g’ in 10pt Times New Roman at 672 DPI
      (left) and 96 DPI (right). The right glyph has been rendered
      with a (primitive) anti-aliasing algorithm and scaled by a
      factor of 7.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The effect of anti-aliasing on a line of text can be seen in
    Figure 5. Anti-aliasing does a very good job at preserving the
    shapes of glyphs. Moreover, the anti-aliased text does not suffer
    from character drift. However, this accuracy comes at the
    sacrifice of clarity—the anti-aliased text has a much lower
    contrast than its hinted counterpart.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="257" height="41" alt="A comparison of anti-aliased
      text" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/anti-aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 5: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI; without
      anti-aliasing or hinting (top), with hinting (middle), with
      anti-aliasing (bottom).</p>
    </div>
    <h2><a name="anti-aliasing-with-hinting">Combining Anti-aliasing
    With Hinting</a></h2>
    <p>Both hinting and anti-aliasing improve the legibility of text
    at low resolutions by making it more consistent. Hinting does this
    at the cost of <em>accuracy</em>, while anti-aliasing does it at
    the cost of <em>contrast</em>. At this point, the logical question
    to ask is “can hinting and anti-aliasing be used in conjunction
    with each other?” The answer is yes—with the appropriate finesse,
    it is possible to hint anti-aliased text.</p>
    <p>In principle, hinting anti-aliased text is exactly the same as
    hinting monochromatic text. However, in practice, a different
    implementation is required in order to produce high-quality
    output <cite><a href="#tur01b">Tur01b</a></cite>. The practicality
    of this depends on the hinting approach taken; it is significantly
    easier when the hinting is performed by the font rasteriser
    instead of a virtual machine. Indeed, naïvely combining TrueType
    hinting with anti-aliasing can often result in a <em>reduction in
    overall consistency</em>! This is most readily observed when
    rendering sans-serif fonts, as can be seen in Figure 6.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="263" height="43" alt="Hinting and anti-aliasing
      combined" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/bytecode-hinting-with-anti-aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 6: 10pt Arial at 96 DPI; with TrueType hinting (top),
      with anti-aliasing (middle), with TrueType hinting and
      anti-aliasing (bottom).</p>
    </div>
    <p>While the output is legible, it lacks consistency—some
    characters, such as ‘w’ and ‘s’, are anti-aliased, while others,
    such as ‘l’, are not. This causes some characters to appear to be
    heavier than others. These heavier characters are often referred
    to as being <em>dirty</em>. The undesirable characteristics
    apparent in Figure 6 arise because the anti-aliased text is being
    hinted <em>as if it were regular monochromatic text</em>. (Which,
    incidentally, is why the application of anti-aliasing has no
    effect on the overall character drift.) But as was established in
    the previous section, anti-aliased text has a <em>lower
    frequency</em> than monochromatic text. The solution, therefore,
    is to use less aggressive hinting. This is quite difficult to
    accomplish when using TrueType hinting, as the virtual machine
    does not …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These are some of the common myths about Patents and Trademarks in startups.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have a startup idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>It’s natural to feel defensive about our <a href="https://hitstartup.com/startup-ideas-vs-problems/" target="_blank">startup idea</a>, but patents are for invention/innovation and not for a startup idea; even if we get nightmares about <a href="https://hitstartup.com/faang-will-steal-my-idea/" target="_blank">FAANG stealing our startup idea</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-an-innovative-app-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have an innovative app idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>Most countries don’t allow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200213051434/https://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/software_patents_fulltext.html" target="_blank">patent for a software</a>. Economic theories, methods of doing business, mathematical methods or computer programs&nbsp;as such&nbsp;are not patentable inventions in several countries.</p><h3 id="my-patent-attorney-said-they-are-patentable">My patent attorney said they are patentable</h3><p>Did you read all the clauses in the agreement you signed with your patent attorney? The decision to award a patent to an invention/innovation lies solely with the patent examiner of the country. By the time a patent application is filed, till it comes to examination, several years and thousands of dollars would have been spent.</p><p>Although ethically, a patent attorney should explicitly convey their doubts on patentability of an invention, few rarely do. Even when Prior Art Search(Searching for conflicting patents) is conducted by the patent attorney, they are not always successful in bringing up the conflicting patents because our patent application is not drafted yet.</p><p>But, when the Govt. patent examiner does the Prior Art Search while examining our patent application, they will likely find conflicting patents if it exists.</p><h3 id="i-have-paid-my-patent-attorney-explained-my-invention-now-all-i-have-to-do-is-just-sit-tight-for-a-patent">I have paid my patent attorney, explained my invention, now all I have to do is just sit tight for a patent</h3><p>An average patent attorney drafts patent for anything from innovation in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet" target="_blank">bidet</a> to quantum computers, so they are experts in using language to define an invention but they are rarely an expert in any field of invention.</p><p>So, this requires utmost care from the inventor to work along with the patent drafter to articulate their invention with appropriate vocabulary.</p><p>Unfortunately, patent attorneys tend to force the inventor to not to be specific in describing their invention in the patent application in order to exploit the loop holes in patent examination; This may help in getting the patent, but it also enables someone else to exploit the same loop holes to file a patent for the copy of our invention by just changing the grammar/vocabulary because our patent was too generic.</p><h3 id="i-have-filed-for-a-patent-no-one-would-copy-my-innovation-invention">I have filed for a patent, no one would copy my innovation/invention</h3><p>Examination of patent takes several years, although in the meantime we could use ‘patent-pending’ tag if our patent application gets published, finding someone who is copying our invention takes proactive approach. If the copied invention is being applied for patent, we need to detect it from published journal of the patent office and raise a concern.</p><p>All these takes extraordinarily focused effort and budget.</p><h3 id="i-have-applied-for-a-patent-via-pct-i-will-receive-patent-for-all-countries">I have applied for a patent via PCT, I will receive patent for all countries</h3><p><a href="https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/" target="_blank">PCT - Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> simplifies the process of applying for a patent in several countries who are part of the PCT treaty, but the process of obtaining a patent depends upon the individual country’s patent laws.</p><p>Even during filing PCT, the second phase i.e. national phase involves filing documents for patent application in the respective individual countries requiring working with the patent attorney’s of those countries resulting in thousands of dollars of expense for each country we wish to apply for via PCT.</p><p>We can extrapolate the same process for patent examination in each of those countries.</p><p>Then there are certain countries which even while being part of the PCT, doesn’t enforce patent protection for inventions of other countries in order to protect their local businesses which copies our invention.</p><h3 id="i-have-received-my-patent-it-would-prevent-someone-from-copying-my-invention">I have received my patent, it would prevent someone from copying my invention</h3><p>Like any law, existence of a law doesn’t prevent someone from violating it; enforcement and judicial process should uphold that law. Similarly, existence of patent doesn’t prevent someone from copying our invention.</p><p>We need to find the violator, pursue an often lengthy and expensive judicial process to claim our right to the invention protected by the patent.</p><h3 id="i-m-the-inventor-in-the-patent-i-can-do-anything-with-it">I’m the inventor in the patent, I can do anything with it</h3><p>Unless the inventor in the patent is the owner of the patent, the inventor has no right to the patent. This is often the case when businesses file patents, where the business is the owner in the patent and the employee is the inventor in the patent.</p><h3 id="patents-are-only-for-protecting-my-invention">Patents are only for protecting my invention</h3><p>The main reason to protect the invention is to reap the value of the invention if needed. Patents offer commercial and strategic value to businesses.</p><p>So, patents are often used for trading them for money or for other patents in organizations apart from using it for protecting their inventions.</p><h3 id="patents-make-me-look-cool">Patents make me look cool</h3><p>Not necessarily, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/new-low-bad-patent-patent-troll-sues-ventilator-company" target="_blank">patent trolls</a> have left a bad taste in the inventor/innovator community; so much so that many are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIihrcqJYA" target="_blank">choosing not to file patent for their invention</a>.</p><p>Expenses, effort, lengthy unfair judicial trials has made several startups to not pursue patent for their invention in favor of capital efficiency.</p><h3 id="open-source-projects-doesn-t-need-patents">Open-source projects doesn’t need patents</h3><p>Open-source projects might need patents to <a href="https://golang.org/PATENTS" target="_blank">protect itself from getting sued for patent infringement</a>.

  <p><time datetime="2020-06-09T09:45:00-0400">Tue, Jun 9, 2020</time></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/posts/hp712-nextstep-part-1">last post of this series</a>, I set up NeXTstep on an HP PA-RISC <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/pizzaboxes/hp712">workstation</a>. Today, I’m going to get down to business: configure networking, install system patches, outfit it with developer tools, and install some useful software!</p>
<p>As with the previous post, I’ve also made a YouTube video that covers roughly the same topics! If video is your speed, I’d love for you to check it out!</p>
<p>

</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My goal is to end up with a capable machine that I can use like it might have been when new, and learn from the experience.</p>
<h2 id="foreshadowing-networking-woes">Foreshadowing networking woes</h2>
<p>While it is possible to transfer files from SCSI drives (or even floppies!), <strong>getting a pizzabox on my home network makes loading software much easier</strong>.
I first tried out NeXTstep on this workstation a couple years ago. The OS installed OK, but I ran in to trouble with networking. I was initially optimistic that I would figure it out:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I'm done for the day but soon if I can fight with NFS and NetInfo (lolololol) I can get screenshots off it and software on</p>— cron mom (@sophaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/962427825608429568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2018</a></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>NARRATOR</strong>: she did not soon win the fight with NFS and NetInfo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hang on a second: NeXTstep is a workstation-focused Unix operating system from the 80s-90s - <strong>how could it be difficult to get it on a network</strong>? The answer is a thing called NetInfo.</p>
<p>In a surprise to exactly no one, NeXTstep, being from a company founded by Steve Jobs, had it’s own NeXT-only ecosystem of tools that fit together amazingly well. <strong>The cornerstone of NeXTstep networking was NetInfo</strong>. If you had a collection of NeXT computers on a network, NetInfo gave you a system to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage user accounts that would work across all machines</li>
<li>configure file sharing</li>
<li>control permissions around access to network resources</li>
<li>assign IP addresses and hostnames</li>
<li>quickly bring new machines in to the network</li>
<li>serve this information in a highly-available manner</li>
</ul>
<p>which is to say: NetInfo is a “directory services” system. That’s all well and good - in the early 1990s that space had many competitors and a “right path” hadn’t yet been established, but…<strong>I don’t <em>want</em> my machine to be part of a directory</strong>, **I just want it to be on my existing TCP/IP network.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-simple-network">Starting a “simple” network</h2>
<p>With that in mind, I (naively) attempted to use the “SimpleNetworkStarter” application.</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

  </figure>
</div>

<p>The SimpleNetworkStarter window has three “steps”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>how we’ll integrate</strong> with an existing NetInfo network (since I don’t intend to interact with one at all, I have to choose “Provide the services specified below”, a sort of catch-all)</li>
<li>Specify <strong>my hostname and IP address</strong> - if I were connecting to an existing NetInfo network, I might not have to do this. “Network Options” lets me set more granular IP settings like netmask and gateway; “NetInfo Options” lets me choose how to integrate with existing domains (if relevant).</li>
<li>Setup <strong>network services</strong>: for my setup I don’t really want <em>any</em> of these things, but as a standalone NeXTstep system, I do have to “Maintain the master copy of network administrative data” (aka, the NetInfo database).</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, this feels like a really good start, but will it let me fetch files from an NFS share?</p>
<h2 id="networking-woes">Networking woes</h2>
<p>I immediately tried connecting to my NAS over NFS - after all, the main point of setting up networking was making it easier to transfer files. Unfortunately, it didn’t work - I could set up the NFS mount with NFSMananger (more on how to do that later), but the mountpoint would always be empty. Here you can see me attempting to reach it by IP address:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/failing-nfs-mount.png" alt="a failing NFS mount">

      <figcaption>
          <p>a failing NFS mount</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>So I had <em>some</em> sort of problem. To narrow down potential issues, I ran a few tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>attempting to ping my NAS</strong> from the workstation - this turned out to not work because NeXTstep doesn’t seem to have any <code>ping</code> command. There are probably ways to accomplish something equivalent with the tools it <em>does</em> have, but I just moved on</li>
<li><strong>attempting to ping the workstation</strong> from elsewhere on my network. This worked - I was able to ping it from my laptop!</li>
<li><strong>attempting to connect to my NAS with FTP</strong> - one of the few network tools NeXTstep <em>does</em> seem to have is FTP, so I gave it a shot. To my surprise, this works!</li>
</ul>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-ip.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)">

      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>It did not work via hostname, though, which points to at least some trouble with DNS. Taking a deeper look at the “NeXTstep 3.3 Network and
System Administration Manual” section on “<a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Docs/NeXTStep/3.3/nsa/11_MixedNet.htmld/index.html">NEXTSTEP Computers in a Mixed Network</a>” (which I probably should have done earlier) shows that <strong>I need to manually configure DNS</strong>. There’s no GUI options for it, you just have to write out an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/resolv-conf.png" alt="editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi">

          <p>editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi</p>

<p>After rebooting, I was able to access the NAS via FTP by hostname:


</p><div>

</div>

<p>But still couldn’t use NFS. What gives? I have network connectivity in both directions, and DNS is also now working! I believe this is as far as I got a few years ago, and man I was FRUSTRATED.</p>
<p>Eventually I thought to look in the system log (<code>/usr/adm/messages</code>) for hints:</p>

<p>and there it was:</p>
<pre><code>autonfsmount: Can't get my address
</code></pre><p>Can’t get…<em>my</em> address? Doesn’t the computer know its own address? While I don’t know <em>why</em> it has to do this (googling has provided me a couple of <a href="https://rute.gerdesas.com/node31.html">quick asides</a> mentioning it, but not much detail), <strong>mounting an NFS server requires working <em>reverse</em> DNS for your IP</strong>.</p>
<p>I do have a real-ish DNS server for my home network, and it populates based on DHCP leases and IP reservations. This workstation, though, was just <strong>using an IP that I habitually hardcode for pizzaboxes (192.168.1.200)</strong>. I double-checked the DHCP server config, and it was indeed set up with a different host for that IP, and not set up at all for this hostname. I replaced that entry with one for <code>hp712</code> at <code>192.168.1.200</code> for the MAC address of my workstation, and crossed my fingers.</p>
<p>It worked! I could browse my NAS from the file-browser.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-an-nfs-mount">Setting up an NFS mount</h2>
<p>After all that rigamarole, the right way to configure a remote NFS mount goes through the NFSManager.app. While NFSManager lets you configure both “exports” (local directories I share with others) and “imports” (remote directories I want to mount locally).</p>

<p>That’s it? A lot of struggle got me to this point, but <em>finally</em> I can transfer files.</p>
<h2 id="patch-tuesday">Patch Tuesday</h2>
<p>The first order of business is to <strong>run system updates</strong>. NeXTstep 3.3 was released in mid-1995, and it had three patch updates: the <a href="https://www.nextop.de/NeXTAnswers/2066.html">first</a> at the end of 1995, and the second and <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/nextstep3.3_patch_3_overview.pdf">third</a> in late 1999. Since NeXT were acquired by Apple in 1997, this patch was made by Apple to address Y2k bugs and other longstanding issues. Thanks, Apple! <a href="https://youtu.be/gaI6kBVyu00?t=28"><em>Thapple</em></a>.</p>
<p>The third patch is a cumulative update, so that should be all I need. Nextcomputers.org generously <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/">hosts</a> the patch for download. Because I’m using an HP PA-RISC machine, I need <code>NS33RISCUserPatch3.tar</code>. System updates need to be installed as the <code>root</code> user, and if you run them as <code>me</code> (the default user) NeXTstep doesn’t prompt to escalate privilges, it just gives an error. Thus, I need to log in as <code>root</code> directly. In order to do that, I need to give the <code>me</code> user a password so the system will stop automatically logging in at boot (giving me a chance to log in as <code>root</code>). To set a password, you go to Preferences.app and navigate to the lock icon.</p>

<p>After a reboot, I’m on the most recent version of NeXTstep for PA-RISC, and ready for the year 2000!</p>

<p>What’s next for making a usable system? Developer tools! <strong>NeXTstep came on two sets of discs - “User” for the main operating system, and the optional “Developer” disc</strong> with compilers, GUI building tools, libraries, and documentation. While there were separate versions of NeXTstep User for CISC (m68k and i386) and RISC (PA-RISC and SPARC) platforms, the Developer disc is “quad-fat” - it contains binaries for all four platforms.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>With Apple’s recent announcement that they are moving away from Intel X86 CPU’s to their own ARM CPU’s for future laptops and desktops I thought it would be a good time to take a look at the some differences that can affect systems programmers working in Rust.</p>

<p>One of the key areas where ARM CPU’s differ from X86 is their memory model. This article will take a look at what a memory model is and how it can cause code to be correct on one CPU but cause race conditions on another.</p>

<h2 id="memory-models">Memory Models</h2>

<p>The way loads and stores to memory interact between multiple threads on a specific CPU is called that architecture’s Memory Model.</p>

<p>Depending on the memory model of the CPU, multiple writes by one thread may become visible to another thread in a different order to the one they were issued in.</p>

<p>The same is true of a thread issuing multiple reads. A thread issuing multiple reads may receive “snapshots” of global state that represent points in time ordered differently to the order of issue.</p>

<p>Modern hardware needs this flexibility to be able to maximize the throughput of memory operations. While CPU clock rates and core counts have been increasing with each new CPU iteration, memory bandwidth has struggled to keep up. Moving data from memory to operate on is often the bottle neck in the performance of applications.</p>

<p>If you’ve never written multi-threaded code, or only done so using higher level synchronization primitives such as <code>std::sync::Mutex</code>, you’ve probably never been exposed to the details of the memory model. This is because the CPU, despite whatever reordering it’s memory model allows it to perform, always presents a consistent view of memory to the current thread.</p>

<p>If we look at the below snippet of code that writes to memory and then reads the same memory straight back, we will always get the expected value of <code>58</code> back when we read. There is never the case that we’d read some stale value from memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read_after_write</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>u32_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>();</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"the value is {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_value</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>I’m using volatile operations because if I used normal pointer operations the compiler is smart enough to skip the memory read and just prints the value <code>58</code>. 
Volatile operations stop the compiler from reordering or skipping our memory operation. However they have no affect on hardware (or the compiler re-ordering relative to non-volatile memory operations).</em></p>

<p>Once we introduce multiple threads, we’re now exposed to the fact that the CPU may be reordering our memory operations.</p>

<p>We can examine the snippet below in a multi-threaded context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>(),</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we initialize the contents of both pointers to <code>0</code>, and then run each function in a different thread, we can list the possible outcomes for the reader. We know that there is no synchronization, but based on our experience with single threaded code we think the possible return values are <code>(0, 0)</code>, <code>(58, 0)</code> or <code>(58, 42)</code>. But the possibility of hardware reordering of memory writes affecting multi-threads means that there is a fourth option <code>(0, 42)</code>.</p>

<p>You might think there are more possibilities due to the lack of synchronization. But all hardware memory models guarantee that aligned loads and store up to the native word size are atomic (u32 or a 32-bit CPU, u64 on a 64-bit CPU). If we changed one of our writes to <code>0xFFFF_FFFF</code>, the read will only ever see the old value or the new value. It will never see a partial value like <code>0xFFFF_0000</code>.</p>

<p>If the details of the CPU’s memory model are hidden away when using regular memory accesses, it seems like we would have no way to control it in multi-threaded programs where it affects program correctness.</p>

<p>Luckily Rust provides as with the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module containing types that gives us the control we need. We use these types to specify exactly the memory ordering requirements our code needs. We trade performance for correctness. We place restrictions on what order the hardware can perform memory operations, taking away any bandwidth optimizations the hardware would want to perform.</p>

<p>When working with the <code>atomic</code> module, we don’t worry about the actual memory models of individual CPU architectures. Instead the operation of the <code>atomic</code> module works on an abstract memory model that’s CPU agnostic. Once we’ve expressed our requirements on the loads and stores using this Rust memory model, the compiler does the job of mapping to the memory model of the target CPU.</p>

<p>The requirements we specify on each operation takes the form of what reordering we want to allow (or deny) on the operation. The orderings form a hierarchy, with each level placing more restrictions the CPU. For example <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> means the CPU is free to perform any reordering it wants. <code>Ordering::Release</code> means that a store can only complete after all proceeding stores have finished.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how atomic memory writes are actually compiled, compared to a regular write.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we look at the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/uVQM8T">X86 assembly</a> for the above code, we see the first three functions produce identical code. It’s not until the stricter <code>SeqCst</code> ordering that we get a different instruction being produced.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_relaxed:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>
        
<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_consistent:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>xchg</span>    <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>eax</span>
        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first two orderings use the <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> (<strong>MOV</strong>e) instruction to write the value to memory. Only the strictest ordering produces a different instruction, <strong><code>XCHG</code></strong> (atomic e<strong>XCH</strong>an<strong>G</strong>), to a raw pointer write.</p>

<p>We can compare that to the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/wWQo8P">ARM assembly</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>

<p>In contrast we can see there is a difference once we hit the release ordering requirement. The raw pointer and relaxed atomic store use <strong><code>STR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore <strong>R</strong>egister) while the release and sequential ordering uses the instruction <strong><code>STLR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore with re<strong>L</strong>ease <strong>R</strong>egister). <em>The <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> instruction in this disassembly is moving the constant <code>58</code> into a register, it’s not a memory operation.</em></p>

<p>We should be able to see the risk here. The mapping between the theoretical Rust memory model and the X86 memory model is more forgiving to programmer error. It’s possible for us to write code that is wrong with respect to the abstract memory model, but still have it produce the correct assembly code and work correctly on some CPU’s.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-multi-threaded-program-using-atomic-operations">Writing a Multi-Threaded Program using Atomic Operations</h2>

<p>The program we’ll be exploring builds upon the concept of storing a pointer value being atomic across threads. One thread is going to perform some work using a mutable object it owns. Once it’s finished that work it’s going to publish that work as an immutable shared reference, using an atomic pointer write to both signal the work is complete and allow reading threads to use the data.</p>

<h2 id="the-x86-only-implementation">The X86 Only Implementation</h2>

<p>If we really want to test how forgiving the X86’s memory model is, we can write multi-threaded code that skips any use of the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module. I want to stress this is not something you should ever actually consider doing. In fact this code has undefined behavior due to not guarding against possible compiler instruction re-ordering (however in Rust 1.44.1 the compiler doesn’t re-order so the code “works”). This is an learning exercise only.</p>
