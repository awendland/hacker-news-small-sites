    <p>Have you ever noticed how you can be fuming with anger one second, and absolutely calm the next?</p>

<p>An asshole driver cuts you off on the highway, and you’re raging. A moment later, you notice him pull into the hospital and your anger melts away. “Yeah, maybe he has a patient in the car with him. Or, maybe someone close is dying. I guess he’s not an asshole after all.”</p>

<p>An obscure rule from Probability Theory, called Bayes Theorem, explains this very well. This 9,000 word blog post is a complete introduction to Bayes Theorem and how to put it to practice. In short, Bayes Theorem is a framework for critical thinking. By the end of this post, you’ll be making better decisions, realise when you’re being unreasonable, and also understand why some people believe in UFOs.</p>

<p>It’s a hefty promise, and there’s a good chance of failure. Implementing these ideas will take emotional effort, but it’s worth it.</p>

<p>Thinking the driver is an asshole is normal. Bayes Theorem expects the same. The difference between Bayes and us is the intensity with which we believe. Most times, the seething anger isn’t warranted. This is probably why we feel stupid about all that anger. It melts away so quickly! This is calibration - aligning our emotions to the intensity of the situation - which we’ll cover as well.</p>

<!-- One way to check = If you're flip flopping between beliefs very quickly, you're probably miscalibrated. -->





<p>There’s no fancy math in this guide. We’re using Probability Theory, but aren’t going into the derivation, nor are we solving probability problems from school textbooks. These things are tedious without understanding the why. Instead, we’ll understand why Bayes Theorem matters, and how to apply it.</p>

<p>To begin with, let’s play a game. Throughout this game, <em>notice</em> how you feel about your decisions. Notice what decisions you’re making, and notice how you find the answer.</p>

<h2 id="the-246-game">The 2,4,6 game</h2>

<p>There’s a black box with a formula inside for generating 3 numbers. Your job is to try and guess this formula. The input box below is connected to the black box. If you give it 3 numbers, it’s going to tell you whether they follow the formula or not. Separate each number with a comma.</p>

<p>To start you off, (2,4,6) follows the pattern. Try it out!</p>





<p>Did you figure it out? Write down your answer in here:</p>

<h2 id="bayes-explanation">Bayes Explanation</h2>

<p>Most people try some sequence of: (4,6,8), (1,2,3) … and end up with either increasing numbers, or increasing numbers that are even. Notice how you’re pretty confident in your answer by the time you write it down. You’ve tried a few examples, and <strong>all</strong> of them made sense!</p>

<p>But perhaps you didn’t think to try (-1,2,10) or (4,2,6).</p>

<p>If my comment made your confidence waver, go ahead and try the input box again. See if you can find a pattern that works. The answer is at the bottom of this section, but don’t skip ahead. Every sentence before that is setting up an important idea.</p>

<h3 id="bayes-theorem">Bayes Theorem</h3>

<p>If you’ve heard of Bayes theorem before, you know this formula:</p>

<p>\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]</p>

<p>Indeed, that’s all there is to it. I bet you’ve also heard the famous formula: \(E = mc^2 \). That’s all there is to mass-energy equivalence. However, figuring out how to harness nuclear energy is still a hard problem. The formula made it possible, but implementing it still took 40 years.</p>

<p>It’s the same with Bayes Theorem. The formula is exciting because of what it implies. We’re discovering the nuclear energy version of Bayes Theorem.</p>

<p>Translated to English, the formula goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To form accurate beliefs, you always start from the information you already have. You update beliefs. You don’t discard everything you know.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- This is Bayes Theorem. Start from a pre-existing belief, a prior, then use the new information you get to update that belief, and finally land at your new belief. -->

<!-- It's wrong to form your beliefs using just the new piece of information you see. -->

<p>The first key component is a hypothesis (H) - the belief we’re talking about.</p>

<p>The second key component is the evidence (E) - what data do we have to support / reject the hypothesis.</p>

<p>The third key component is probability (P) of the above two. This probability is our confidence in the belief.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with probability theory, you learned this in school. If not, don’t worry, there are <a href="https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent mathematical introductions</a> to explain it to you. We’ll skip the math, and focus on how to use it.</p>

<p>Our point of interest, and where bayes truly shines is where we compare two hypotheses. Instead of uncovering the absolute probabilities, which is hard, this focuses on how much more likely one hypothesis is, compared to another. Most reasoning in our mind takes this form.</p>

<!-- does it? - This is what makes contrast so valuable. -->

<p>In this case, the formula looks like:</p>

<p>\[ Posterior \hspace{2mm} Odds = Prior \hspace{2mm} Odds * Likelihood \hspace{2mm} Odds \]</p>

<p>Posterior odds measure how likely a hypothesis is compared to another one.</p>

<p>Prior odds measure how likely it was before we had any new evidence.</p>

<p>Likelihood odds measure how well the evidence explains the current hypothesis, compared to the other one. We’ll explore what this means with the help of examples.</p>

<p>\[ \text{Likelihood Odds} = \frac{ \text{Probability of evidence assuming hypothesis is true}}{\text{ Probability of evidence assuming competing hypothesis is true}}\]</p>

<p>We’ll start with the 2,4,6 game to show how qualitatively, math and intuition agree. Then we’ll get into a simpler example where we’re miscalibrated and do the math.</p>

<p>I’m going to choose my path through the 2,4,6 game, but I hope yours was similar enough. If not, try doing this on your own!</p>

<p>I have a hypothesis I want to test, \(H_{3even}\) = 3 even numbers in increasing order. It’s implicit here, but the hypothesis I’m testing this against is \(H_{not-3even}\), or that the formula <strong>is not</strong> 3 even numbers in increasing order.</p>

<p>I input (4,6,8) and the black box says “Yes”. My confidence in 3 even numbers rises. In Bayesian-speak, my posterior odds have increased, because the likelihood odds have increased. And the likelihood odds have increased, since the probability of (4,6,8) saying “Yes” is higher when the formula is \(H_{3even}\).</p>

<p>You’ll notice how <em>you feel</em> every new number that matches your hypothesis makes your belief stronger.</p>

<!-- This corresponds to a likelihood odds of greater than 1, since the belief you're testing is getting stronger. -->

<!--Too many ideas: A question to ponder here: Can (4,6,8) be acceptable in a world where \\(H_{not-3even}\\) is true? That is, the formula is not 3 even increasing numbers? This is seeking disconfirming evidence -->

<p>I try (1,2,3) next. “Yes”. What? I expected “No”!</p>

<p>Everything tumbles, like it should, when you find something that doesn’t follow the pattern. The probability of (1,2,3) saying “Yes” is higher with \(H_{not-3even}\), since (1,2,3) are not all even. The likelihood odds are in favour of \(H_{not-3even}\) now, which means we discard \(H_{3even}\). In this case, one small piece of evidence was enough to completely flip the scales.</p>

<p>Then, which new hypothesis should you try? The clues usually lie in how you disproved the previous hypothesis.</p>

<p>I tried (1,2,3) which said “Yes”, when I expected it to say “No”. My new hypothesis thus became “3 increasing numbers”.</p>

<p>Just like in the previous case, (4,2,6) saying “Yes” killed this hypothesis. My new hypothesis thus became “3 positive numbers”.</p>

<p>I tried (-1,2,3), which said “No”! This was all I needed to become reasonably confident in “3 positive numbers”. The more negative numbers I tried, the more confident I got.</p>

<p>3 positive numbers is indeed correct.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Graphically, this is what’s happening with the 3 hypotheses:</p>

<div role="alert">
  <p><i></i><b>Blue Box on Can we prove something to be true with Bayes?</b><br>
No matter how much data you have, you can never say something is true. This is the problem of induction.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>However, after a certain level of confidence, you live your life believing it’s true. Once you start believing is when you must pay close attention to evidence that doesn’t fit.</p>
</div>

<p>Calibration is key. What we’ve just shown is our thinking process, and how Bayes theorem is mostly aligned with it when we’re thinking well. Bayes theorem updates beliefs in the same direction our brains do, but what changes is how much each piece of evidence influences us!</p>

<p>With this next example, let’s get into the basic math. We’ll revisit the 2,4,6 game in a bit.</p>

<h3 id="being-late-example">Being Late Example</h3>

<p>Your colleague is sometimes late to work. They’ve been on time 4 times, and late 3 times the past week. How many more times would it take you to start believing they’re “always” late?</p>

<p>In my experience, just a few more times does the trick. But let’s use Bayes to calibrate.</p>

<p>Since there’s no good reason to expect tardiness over punctuality, let’s say the prior odds are 1:1.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13">2</a></sup> The alternative hypothesis, the one we’re testing against is “not always being late”. To make this more concrete, let’s say this means they’re late only 10% of the time.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup></p>

<p>We’ll use the data we have to calculate the likelihood of being late. We want to contrast
<span>the data<span>being late thrice, and on time 4 times</span></span>
with us believing that they’re almost always on time, or almost always late. Remember, to figure this out, we imagine believing the first hypothesis, then judge how likely the data is. Then, we imagine believing the second hypothesis, and judge how likely the data is.</p>

<p>There are several ways to mathematically represent this data, from a binomial function to a beta distribution. However, we’re not getting into that yet. Today is more about an intuitive explanation, one which you’re more likely to use …</p></div></div>

                <p>I was <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-with-jason-podcast/noah-gibbs-3/">recently on Jason Swett’s podcast again</a>. He’s a great interviewer and I always have fun with him.</p>

<p>By Twitter request we talked about… When would you <strong><em>not</em></strong> use Rails? It’s a great question.</p>

<p>For the entertaining version, <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-with-jason-podcast/noah-gibbs-3/">listen to the podcast</a>. For the just-the-facts extra-complete version, I’m writing this post.</p>

<h2>When Is Rails the Wrong Choice?</h2>

<p>I’ll start with a few simple, obvious times you wouldn’t use Rails, and then I’ll talk about some technically interesting times.</p>

<p>First, and most important, is team familiarity. If your team doesn’t already know Rails and isn’t especially interested in learning it then Rails is the wrong choice. This should be obvious, but it still deserves first billing.</p>

<p>Second, when you know some other framework fits better. I’ll talk more below about when that is. But sometimes you have a specific concern that trumps everything else. If you need to use a Java-language machine learning library and you don’t want to use JRuby for some reason, Rails isn’t your framework. If you’re writing a WordPress plugin, you’ll be doing it in PHP. Often there’s one specific compatibility concern that overrides everything else.</p>

<p>You can also think of it as: use it where Rails’ good points hold and its bad points don’t. So we’ll also talk about the good and bad points.</p>

<p>Separately: you’d normally only use Rails as an HTTP server, so some tasks just aren’t Rails-shaped.</p>

<h2>When is Rails Too Much?</h2>

<figure>
    <a href="https://rubymadscience.com/img/assistant_pirate_with_sphere_bigthumb.png">
      <img src="https://rubymadscience.com/img/assistant_pirate_with_sphere_bigthumb.png" alt="A pirate puppet with an eyepatch, safety goggles and a huge scraggly mustache watches over a purple crystal ball at his feet.'" title="He's too much lab assistant for your lab.">
    </a>
        <figcaption>He’s too much lab assistant for your lab.</figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>Some places not to use Rails can include:</p>

<p><strong>Really Small Tasks that Won’t Grow</strong>: if a server does very little, Rails is often too much. Not going to touch a database? Then the DB setup isn’t helping you, is it? Just a tiny low-traffic intermediate server with no caching? A lot of Rails is more trouble than it’s worth.</p>

<p>Be careful with tasks that grow, though — making a tiny server scale up to do a lot more can be ugly. If you’re already serving HTTP pages to a human with a web browser, consider that you may have to add features to it later. Something like <strong><em>that</em></strong> is already fairly large from the word “go”.</p>

<p><strong>When It’s ‘Just’ an API Server</strong>: Rails has less to offer an API server that speaks JSON over the wire. A lot of its HTTP security doesn’t matter for that case (e.g. SQL injection safeguards, XSS prevention.) While ActiveRecord can be nice for some database use cases, Rails really shines when you’re building an HTML site that talks to browsers. Very small projects that mostly speak a structured format read by machines will often get less from Rails.</p>

<p>Related to that is when you’re doing in-browser rendering and Rails is ‘just’ serving JSON. It’s a weird kind of in-between case. A lot of Rails security and convenience functions no longer help you, but you’re still doing things where internal libraries (ActiveRecord, ActiveJob, ActionMailer) can be highly useful. But if you’re never rendering HTML on the server and you’re very sure you never will, Rails will probably help you less.</p>

<h2>When Is Rails Not Enough?</h2>

<p>Rails is also designed for a small team and a medium-sized codebase. A huge team (lots of programmers) or a huge codebase (lots of controllers, models and/or lines of code) will tend to drag down the standard Rails-app structure.</p>

<p>Ruby allows for a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">non-local effects</a>. Whether that’s monkeypatching, writing to a database or creating new types at runtime, Ruby isn’t designed for a team of 200 programmers where you don’t trust some of them. There are too many ways for them to cause you trouble. You can use <a href="https://sorbet.org/">good tooling</a> to scale Ruby to larger teams, but even that will <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/troubleshooting#escape-hatches">tend to have exceptions and difficulties</a>. That’s not really Ruby’s sweet spot.</p>

<p>In most cases you can cut up a large project into smaller projects. If one Rails app is too big, you can often separate it into multiple apps, or a thinner app with more back-end services, or an app and a separate microservice, or… One way or another there is usually a way to separate out smaller pieces. Ruby strongly encourages that, as do I.</p>

<p>There are also not-quite-Rails structures that can scale better. Avdi Grimm’s (now retired) <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13481927-objects-on-rails">Objects on Rails</a> was an attempt in that direction, as is <a href="https://medium.com/@vsavkin/hexagonal-architecture-for-rails-developers-8b1fee64a613">the Hexagonal architecture for Rails</a>, which in turn has a lot in common with the older and more general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">N-tier architecture</a>.</p>

<p>But at some point you might want to consider a different framework. <a href="https://hanamirb.org/">Hanami</a> is an obvious choice, designed to be less quick and nimble than Rails for getting a tiny app off the ground, but more scalable if you want to use the same code with a lot more contributors.</p>

<p>I’d still start out in Rails, personally. If you’re building something quickly to see if anybody cares, I know of no framework that comes close to its productivity. Wait to rewrite (in a more rigid framework) until you’re successful and you can afford the drag on your development speed.</p>

<p>The other worry here can be performance. If you’re rewriting a project that is already as large as the current Basecamp… then you’re <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/only-15-of-the-basecamp-operations-budget-is-spent-on-ruby/">actually fine for performance</a>. Rails still scales <strong><em>great</em></strong> for them. But if you’re looking at something a hundred times larger (which by definition means B2C, not B2B) then you might have a situation where your server costs are substantially greater than your engineering payroll. In that case it can make sense to slow down your engineers to pay lower server costs. To check this, see what your EC2-or-equivalent costs are <strong><em>just for your application servers</em></strong>, which are what run Rails. And check your payroll <strong><em>just for web engineers</em></strong>, which is who writes in Rails. Normally the engineering payroll is much larger and you should stick with trading cheap machine time for expensive engineering time. But at some point the balance may tip and you should consider raising your engineering payroll to cut your server costs.</p>

<h2>When Does Rails Have the Wrong Assumptions?</h2>

<figure>
    <a href="https://rubymadscience.com/img/dr_bear_microscope_bigthumb.png">
      <img src="https://rubymadscience.com/img/dr_bear_microscope_bigthumb.png" alt="A pirate, a bear and a chimp sit at a wicker table. The bear looks into a very old-fashioned microscope as the other two look on." title="They're checking the microscope for real-world use cases where Rails might be wrong.">
    </a>
        <figcaption>They’re checking the microscope for real-world use cases where Rails might be wrong.</figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>Before checking if Rails’ assumptions are right for you, we should see what those assumptions actually are.</p>

<p>Before you take my word for it, I recommend taking <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/">David Heinemeier Hansson’s word for it</a> in the form of The Rails Doctrine. It’s a great document and it covers a lot of ground.</p>

<p>Indeed, if you want to better understand why Rails isn’t amazing for large, low-trust teams, you should read <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#provide-sharp-knives">“Provide Sharp Knives”</a> in the Rails Doctrine several times. A lot of Rails’ tradeoffs are entirely by design.</p>

<p>Rails also has some simpler assumptions: it assumes you’re writing an interactive app with server-rendered HTML. It assumes that security is vital (Rails trades a lot for security) but that you don’t want to build your own custom security system in most cases. And it assumes that you either have a small, excellent team doing prototyping work (“Provide Sharp Knives”) or that you have a possibly-mediocre team that needs powerful built-in guidelines (<a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#omakase">“The Menu is Omakase.”</a>)</p>

<p>Rails also assumes you want high developer velocity at a cost of technical debt. In other words, it’s designed for building very quickly. That makes sense when <strong><em>technical execution is not your biggest risk</em></strong>. For instance: if you’re building a small startup, and you’re pretty sure you can build the site but people may not buy your product, you are dominated by market risk. That’s when Rails is perfect. You want to build very quickly. And even if you build perfectly, you’re probably going to have to throw away the result for nontechnical reasons, like “people don’t want to buy it.”</p>

<p>As part of “high dev velocity, technical debt is okay” Rails assumes things like, “you’ll want to use a lot of gems” and “dependencies that work are fine if they speed you up.”</p>

<p>Rails assumes you don’t mind scaling out application servers horizontally (by bringing more of them online.) It’s designed to scale well <strong><em>if</em></strong> you can do that. Rails assumes CPU is fairly cheap and it’s usually right about that. Relatedly, Rails assumes that the database is usually your most serious performance bottleneck, which is how web applications usually work.</p>

<p>Rails also assumes you’ll have some calculation or data transformation in your application. It assumes that it’s okay to use some CPU because you’ll be doing that anyway.</p>

<p>(When does that last assumption matter? Let’s talk about Evented Servers and see.)</p>

<h2>What Isn’t Rails Good At?</h2>

    </a>
        <figcaption>Sometimes you need it, or something like it.</figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>While Rails is great at a lot of things, there’s one particular task that it’s not amazing for: shim servers.</p>

<p>By “shim servers” I mean servers that do very little calculation but integrate answers from a few other back-end services and relay the result. Imagine a server that queries two JSON services and combines the result with simple string-manipulation, for instance. It does very little calculation, but it juggles a lot of events.</p>

<p>And that’s the relevant word: “events.”</p>

<p>There is a specific kind of app architecture embodied by Node.js and its relatives called “Evented” programming. It can support many thousands, or even millions, of simultaneous connections with a tiny amount of server resources. It can be both high-throughput and low-latency. Its benchmark numbers are matchless… for the cases where it works.</p>

<p>Rails can’t match Evented programming at what Evented programming is good at. Basically no framework can. There are Evented frameworks for Ruby (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine">EventMachine</a>, <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">Async</a>.) Rails is built differently.</p>

<p>If Evented is so much better, why don’t we use it for everything? Because it doesn’t work for everything. I emphasise calculation per-request because an Evented server will fall down and die if you try to make it do very much calculation per-request. Having one server handle a million connections is no good if each connection …</p></div></article></div>

<p>If you’ve been a software engineer for long enough, it is very likely that you’ve seen this example of floating point perfidy:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>3.0</span> / <span>10</span>
<span>0.3</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>0.1</span> * <span>3</span>
<span>0.30000000000000004</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We understand that this is due to the fact that floating point numbers, stored
with only 64 bits of precision, cannot represent the entire real number line.
Moreover, when we perform operations with these floating point numbers, the
errors inherent in their representation can accumulate and multiply. The moral
of the story is, never use a floating point number to represent money.</p>
<p>At least, that is the moral for financial applications. At Square, we used a
<code>long amount_cents</code>, and we got along with our lives. However, for most
applications that have a good reason to use floating point, this can’t be the
end of the story. If floating point were the unpredictable, unreliable thing
that I once believed it to be, we wouldn’t be able to numerically solve
differential equations, or linear systems, or land on the moon. Rather, there is
a science of floating point error, forming part of a science of numerical errors
in general, which seeks to tame and understand what happens to errors as they
flow through our calculations. In general, numerical error is something that can
be rather precisely quantified, as we’ll see. Along the way we’ll look at the
Fundamental Axiom of Floating Point Arithmetic, which, at the very least, sounds
way cooler than “10 things every developer should know about floating point
numbers”.</p>
<h2 id="machine-epsilon">Machine Epsilon</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, error in floating point is due to the problem of “roundoff”. Just as in base 10, we cannot represent the
number \(1/3\) without rounding it off somewhere:</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{3} = 0.33333333333333 \dots \approx 0.33333333,
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>in base 2, we cannot represent many numbers without rounding. Of course, some numbers we <em>can</em> represent exactly. The
number 1, for example. Or any integer in the range \((-2^{53}, 2^{53})\). Also notably, many fractions can be exactly
represented:</p>
<p>\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} &amp;= 0.1_2 \\\<br>
\frac{3}{4} &amp;= 0.11_2 \\\<br>
\frac{17}{8} &amp;= 10.001_2 \\\<br>
&amp;\vdots
\end{align*}</p>
<p>However, a number like \(1/10\), just like \(1/3\) in base 10, must be truncated to fit in the 24 or 53 bits of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand">mantissa</a>. When we enter <code>0.1</code> in a console or in source code, the value that is <em>actually stored</em> is very slightly
different than <code>0.1</code>. According to this excellent <a href="https://www.exploringbinary.com/floating-point-converter/">IEEE-754 Floating Point Converter</a>, the floating point number that is
actually stored (for 64-bit floating point) is</p>
<p>\begin{align*}
&amp;(0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001101)_2 = \\\<br>
&amp;(0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625)_{10}
\end{align*}</p>
<p>So the initial input to our calculation was flawed! We weren’t calculating <code>0.1 * 3</code>, we were actually calculating</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625</span> * <span>3</span>
</code></pre></div><p>How much of an error is this? We can get an idea by counting the zeros in between the significant
digits, \(0.100\dots 00055\). In this case, there are 16. So in simply entering a number which is not representable
exactly in floating point, we have incurred a relative error of roughly \(10^{-16}\).</p>
<p>Indeed, in <em>all</em> cases we can expect to incur a relative error of
roughly \(10^{-16}\). This magnitude is called machine epsilon, often
written \(\epsilon_{\text{machine}}\). It comes from the relative difference
between two successive floating point numbers. For every representable floating
point number \(x\), there is a <em>next</em> floating point number, and it is
approximately \(x + \epsilon_{\text{machine}} x\). So for an arbitrary real
number \(x_0\), it falls between two floating point values \(x\)
and \(x + \epsilon x\) (leaving off the subscript of \(\epsilon\) for conciseness). When we
represent \(x_0\) in floating point, we will get one of these two values. Let’s denote
the floating point representation of \(x_0\) by \(\text{fl}(x_0)\). The absolute
error incurred just by representing \(x_0\) in floating point is</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
e_{\text{abs}} = |\text{fl}(x_0) - x_0| \leq \max(|x_0 - x|, |x_0 - (x + \epsilon x)|) \leq |\epsilon x|.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>The relative error, then, i.e. the absolute error divided by the true value, is</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
e_{\text{rel}} = \frac{e_{\text{abs}}}{x_0} \leq \frac{|\epsilon x|}{x_0} \approx \epsilon.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>Cool! So we’ve seen that the worst we can do, in relative terms, when representing a floating point number, is
approximately \(10^{-16}\). This is, for almost all practical purposes, <em>very good</em>. Because remember, we’re speaking of
a relative error. That means we’re able to represent even very small values, very accurately. Here’s the nearest floating point
number to \(10^{-20}\):</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
0.000000000000000000009999999999999999451532\dots
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>If you’re curious, I invite you to count the 9’s. There are 16 of them. Even when dealing with extremely small numbers,
we maintain the same relative precision.</p>
<h2 id="the-fundamental-axiom-of-floating-point-arithmetic">The Fundamental Axiom of Floating Point Arithmetic</h2>
<p>Now you might be thinking, wait! It’s all good and well that we can get excellent relative accuracy when <em>representing</em>
floating point numbers, but what about when we go to <em>do</em> something with them? Here we’ve got two floating point
numbers, both of which are inexact, and we’re about to multiply them! Who knows what might happen?</p>
<p>This concern is well-founded, because the algorithms of floating point arithmetic must be implemented with finite
precision. If we are asked to multiply two large numbers with pen and paper, the algorithm that most
of us will use is the one we learned in school, which involves lots of addition, carrying, sub-multiplications, and so
on. If all of those intermediate steps are using some kind of binary representation, then the intermediate products may
be losing precision as we go along! This seems like a recipe for disaster. Fortunately, there is a property that we can
require of a floating point implementation, one which is satisfied by IEEE-754 and most other popular floating point
standards, that will save us from total anarchy. This is what Trefethen and Bau, <em>Numerical Linear Algebra</em>, refer to
as the <strong>Fundamental Axiom of Floating Point Arithmetic</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All floating point arithmetic operations are exact up to a relative error of \(\epsilon_{\text{machine}}\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that for any two floating point numbers, say \(x\) and \(y\), any operation involving them will give a floating
point result which is within a factor of \(1 + \epsilon_{\text{machine}}\) of the true result. This is easiest to
understand if we use a special notation to represent the floating point version of, say, \(+\). Let’s write \(\oplus\) to
denote floating point addition, and \(+\) to denote exact addition. Then the Fundamental Axiom tells us,</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
\frac{|(x \bigoplus y) - (x + y)|}{x + y} \leq \epsilon_{\text{machine}}.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>Remember, \(x\) and \(y\) are exactly representable as floating point numbers, but of course they are also, mathematically,
just real numbers. So \(x + y\) is a real number (point on the number line), which <em>may not be exactly representable in
floating point</em>. The Fundamental Axiom is telling us that the floating point operation \(\oplus\) can do no worse than
simply trying to represent the number \(x + y\) as a floating point value directly, assuming our computer had access to the
mathematical, infinite precision object \(x + y\).</p>
<p>Put another way, we incur no extra error by going through floating point
arithmetic than we would by using a magical computer to do exact arithmetic on
our floating point values and then casting back to floating point. In
mathematical terms,</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
\frac{\left|(\text{fl}(a) \oplus \text{fl}(b)) - (a + b)\right|}{a + b} \approx \frac{\left|\text{fl}(\text{fl}(a) + \text{fl}(b)) - (a + b)\right|}{a + b} \approx \epsilon_{\text{machine}}.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>Recall that \(\text{fl}(a)\) is the mathematical number we actually represent when
we try to represent \(a\) in floating point. So the first fraction gives the
relative error from performing \(\oplus\) on the floating point representations
of \(a\) and \(b\), and the second fraction gives the relative error from performing
the exact arithmetic operation, \(+\), on the floating point representations
of \(a\) and \(b\), then casting the result to floating point.</p>
<h2 id="error-analysis">Error Analysis</h2>
<p>The Fundamental Axiom of Floating Point Arithmetic allows us to analyze the numerical error that may be incurred by even
complex arithmetic operations. To see an idea of how this works, let’s consider the problem of computing the length of a
2D vector, \([x, y]\). Mathematically, this has the form</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>There are several stages to the computation, and at each one we will incur a little bit of numerical error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the numbers \(x\) and \(y\) into the computer, incurring roundoff error.</li>
<li>Compute \(x^2\) and \(y^2\), using floating point multiplication.</li>
<li>Compute \(x^2 + y^2\), using floating point addition.</li>
<li>Compute \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), using the floating point square root operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>At each step, the result we get will be equal to the true result, times some error factor \((1 + \epsilon)\), where
each \(\epsilon\) is very small, on the order of \(\epsilon_\text{machine}\). Each operation may have a different
error \(\epsilon\), but we’ll use the same symbol for all of them. We don’t care so much about the exact value
of \(\epsilon\), only that it is very small.</p>
<p>We’re going to carry these \(\epsilon\) through the computation to see how they
affect the final result. To make that easier, we can use special rules of arithmetic to manipulate \(\epsilon\):</p>
<ul>
<li>\(\epsilon^2 = 0\). If \(\epsilon \approx 10^{-16}\), then \(\epsilon^2 \approx 10^{-32}\), which is so small that we just
decide to completely ignore it.</li>
<li>\((1 + \epsilon)^2 = 1 + 2\epsilon + \epsilon^2 = 1 + 2\epsilon\).</li>
<li>\(\sqrt{1 + \epsilon} = 1 + \frac{\epsilon}{2} - …</li></ul></div></div>

This is my experience to purge my life of Google and I can assure you it’s difficult but if we don’t act soon it will become impossible.</p><div>
		
<p>It’s been 1.5 years since Google+ closed and <a href="https://homehack.nl/category/social/page/2/">I started dipping my toes</a> into the Fediverse and other distributed social networks. It also kicked off my search to get rid of everything Google. To <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle">DeGoogle</a> is easier said than done because Google is everywhere from search to fonts, from the video platform YouTube to the file storage and synchronisation service Google Drive, and from blog publishing service Blogger to the Google mobile operating system Android. And the list goes on. So chances are you’re using a lot of these services and most of them require a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Account">Google account</a>, a devious move from Google. It’s for this reason that it’s very hard to get rid of this o so convenient account.</p>

<p>To get a more comprehensive view take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products">this article</a>. Below I’ve compiled a list of the most important Google services and products that I replaced with something else.</p>



<h2>Google Search</h2>



<p>Search was perhaps the easiest to replace (or is it). While Google search is by far the largest search engine in the world DuckDuckGo (DDG) is becoming <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic">increasingly popular</a>. I’ve  used DDG to great satisfaction and only had to use Google search a couple of times. The only gripe that I have is that DDG isn’t free and open source software (FLOSS) let alone distributed. In that respect I’ve read some good things about <a href="https://searx.me/">Searx</a> and I may give that a try in the future.</p>



<h2>Chrome</h2>



<p>The Chrome browser of Google has become very popular with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#Market_share">estimated market share of approximately 70%</a>. A large portion of the Chrome’s source code is based on Chromium, the open source browser project from Google,  however Chrome is proprietary freeware because it contains large blobs of proprietary code. The Spyware Watchdog considers <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/chrome.html">Chrome’s Spyware level extremely high</a> this due to multiple spyware features that are built-in such as Google Account and Navigation Assistance. Another threat come from the earlier mentioned market share. This gets even worse when we include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Active">other browsers that are based on Chromium</a> such as Microsoft Edge, Opera and Vivaldi.  I currently use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. It’s perhaps not the most privacy minded browser around but it’s FLOSS, it has a reasonable market share which is important for support of web developers and development of Firefox is very active. </p>



<h2>YouTube</h2>



<p>Next is YouTube which BTW is becoming more and more annoying with all these ads and the recommendations with the sole purpose to keep the user as long as possible on YouTube (and serve even more ads). I invested a lot in YouTube in the past with over 70 video made about 3D CAD, 3D printing and electronics so replacing it is not easy. The solution that I found is two-fold. I remastered (part) of my existing videos and uploaded them to both <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a> and YouTube. If I want to watch YouTube videos I use <a href="https://www.invidio.us/">Invidious</a> in the browser of <a href="https://newpipe.schabi.org/">NewPipe</a> on my Smartphone (still Android sadly).  </p>



<h2>Google Drive</h2>



<p>Over the years I got dependant on Google Drive e.g to store the CAD files that I wanted to share after I published a project either in blog or a video. I want readers and viewers to be able to reproduce the project. Since I didn’t want to self-host a solution <s>such as <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> wasn’t for me</s> (see edit below). I started looking for a paid service. I currently have a contract with Strato, a German hosting company that also hosts my websites. Strato offers HiDrive, it’s not FLOSS unfortunately but it offers 100% storage in the EU and (paid) end-to-end encryption is possible although only in the HiDrive desktop program for Windows (which is a bummer but I don’t need encryption for this purpose anyway).</p>



<h2>Google Maps</h2>



<p>Instead of Google maps I started using <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> and products based on OpenStreetMap such as <a href="https://osmand.net/">OsmAnd</a> (on Android) and <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Komoot">Komoot</a> both on Android and the web browser. Komoot is excellent for hiking and cycling but unfortunately it isn’t FLOSS. These alternatives have proven to be good enough for me since I haven’t used Google Maps any more. </p>



<h2>Gmail</h2>



<p>I somehow started using Gmail. I don’t know exactly why because I already had very good email services. I also fail to understand why it’s so popular because every other email service does about the same. My own ISP comes with a very good email service and so is the web hosting company that I’m using. To stop using Gmail takes some preparation most importantly to list and notify all the people and organisations that send you email to your Gmail address. Also list all online services that use your Gmail address. Now replace this Gmail address with another email address.</p>



<p>You may want to delete your Gmail completely but it’s possible that it’s linked to your Google account. If this is the case you can either <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Your-Email-Address-on-Google">use a different email address </a>for this account or more radical <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-your-gmail-account-1172073">delete your Google account</a> completely. In case you choose the latter remember that lots of Google services are couples to your Google account and can’t be accessed any more. Having said that if you start to purge Google from your life the Google account becomes less and less important with every Google service that you delete. So at a certain point deleting the Google account will be painless.</p>



<h2>Android</h2>



<p>Although Android is Free and Open Source software most Android phones come with proprietary software and services that prevent users from using the phone the way they seem fit. The easy way to free the software on your phone is to install <a href="https://f-droid.org/">FDroid</a>. For most users the Google Play Store is the only way to install software on their phone. FDroid is an alternative software store that enables the user to easily install and maintain Free and Open Source software on their Android device. BTW installing FDroid and replacing proprietary apps is what I have done thus far and it’s a good start.</p>



<p>Even better is to replace the Google infested Android with a free version of Android like <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>. LineageOS is a FLOSS version of Android that can be used without a Google account and that comes without the proprietary Google apps (and perhaps other junk from the phone manufacturer). Make sure to check if your phone is supported before trying to install in on your phone.</p>



<h2>Fonts</h2>



<p>Yes I know, I have Google fonts in my blog. That came with the choice of the WordPress theme and I didn’t realize that at the time. That’s just another example how Google infested the web and how difficult it is to DeGoogle my life but rest assured fonts will be next.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>To get Google out of your digital life is hard, very hard. This tells us how much Google is integrated into our lives and probably for the most part without being aware of it. Luckily we still have choice (other than just say goodbye to the web), choice that gives us freedom to use the web without being used. The freedom to control our data and not being exploited. </p>



<p>E<em>dit: As someone on Mastodon pointed out it’s not necessary to self-host NextCloud. Examples of cloud service providers running Nextcloud are <a href="https://disroot.org/en/services/nextcloud">Disroot</a>, <a href="https://www.owncube.com/index_en.php">OwnCube</a> and <a href="https://operationtulip.com/">Operationtulip.com</a> (currently in beta). </em></p>

  <p>On the off chance there’s anyone out there who still believes open software’s “funding” problems reflect something special about software, have a read through <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/the-truth-is-paywalled-but-the-lies-are-free/">Nathan Robinson’s recent editor’s note, “The Truth Is Paywalled But The Lies Are Free”</a>.  Perhaps we can see in another what’s so hard to see in ourselves.</p>

<p>In my reading, the problem here is evident: black-and-white, either-or thinking.  Nathan begins his essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paywalls are justified, even though they are annoying. … I try not to grumble about having to pay for content online, because I run a magazine and I know how difficult it is to pay writers what they deserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But by the end, he’s regressed to an insoluble-sounding conflict-of-goals again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creators must be compensated well.  But at the same time we have to try to keep things that are important and profound from getting locked away where few people will see them.  The truth needs to be free and universal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To this I would respond, not just to Nathan, but to everyone stuck at this impasse:  Don’t worry.  You’re not stuck.  None of the above is true.</p>

<p>Creators needn’t be compensated well just because they are creators.  Creators of valuable works—works valued by others—ought to be compensated.  Creators of highly and broadly valued works ought to be compensated well.  I deserve, and shall assuredly receive, no compensation whatever for the bad musical improvizations, repetitive doodles, or unfunny, dead-end software libraries I churn out from time to time.  Everyone, including me, should be fine with this.</p>

<p>Neither must useful works of every kind cost nothing to everyone.  Even the greatest works remain manifestly irrelevant to the vast majority of people.  And there are myriad, happier mediums between $0, expensive, and exclusive, in one dimension, and effortless, inconvenient, and inaccessible, in the other.</p>

<p>I happen to believe that in most areas of creative work, and in most adjacent industries, giving more away for $0 online would improve outcomes for most players, overall.  Our business instincts and well-worn patterns haven’t quite kept up with the times, and never do.  But there is nothing inherently worse about paying a fee you can afford than enduring an inconvenience you have the time to manage.  When the works we need or want come readily available at affordable costs that we can pay, and paying is easy, there’s no great harm to access or progress or truth.  That cost many not be great.  But if a great many pay it, the results can be.</p>

<p>For those interested in economics, intellectual property, and history in the news industry specifically, I heartily recommend <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29452">Will Slauter’s <em>Who Owns the News?</em></a>.  You might also read up a bit on stalwart news institutions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press">like the Associated Press</a>.  What you find might surprise you.</p>

<p>This picture  may appear to be a collection of color fields without meaning or  purpose, but there is a ton of math and evil genius behind this image.</p>
<p><strong>This is a view of Magnasanti, the metropolis that pushes SimCity to its population limits. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span id="more-2933"></span></strong>Here is a closer view:</p>

<p>Vincent Oscala, a 22-year old architecture student from the Philippines, spent years decoding the formula for success in Sim City 3000.</p>
<p>Sounds like lunacy…but his insane investment of effort into “beating” SimCity raises interesting questions about the urban landscapes we inhabit, and the ways in which they can go horribly wrong.</p>

<p>After a massive amount of planning and a great deal of trial and error, he was able to create a city with over six million inhabitants.</p>
<p>Moreover, the city he created was remarkably stable, with no abandoned buildings and no wasted space. There are no roads — all transit is mass transit. An omniscient police force has eliminated all crime in the city. Magnasanti’s water and power needs are supplied by neighboring cities, eliminating the need for much of the related infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>In SimCity </strong><strong>terms</strong><strong>, it is a masterpiece.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But at the “street level,” so to speak, it looks like a horrifying dystopia. </strong></p>
<p>Unemployment is high, air pollution is stifling, education is largely absent, medical care and fire response are non-existent. Citizens do not live to reach retirement age. The police state has essentially eliminated free will and allowed the city to maximize its size while reducing quality of life to a minimum — and still maintaining total control over the citizens.</p>
<p>Every person living in Magnasanti spends his life working and residing in one small, massively efficient block of space, until death around age 50.</p>

<p>Here is a video that explains some of the development process for Magnasanti, including two smaller cities that served as development prototypes for Oscala’s final achievement:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="630" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTJQTc-TqpU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As the soundtrack indicates, Oscala was highly influenced by the art film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisquatsi" target="_blank">Koyaanisquatsi</a>, or “Life out of Balance,” directed by Godfrey Reggio with music by Philip Glass.</p>
<p>Koyaanisquatsi is a non-narrative work that examines and explores the contrasts between the form and pace of nature and modern human life. Ultimately, the film confronts us with the fact that our species is living a life out of balance with nature, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>It’s a really cool movie that is highly recommended. Here’s a teaser:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="630" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFBijDU8PpE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Now, you may be asking, what in the world does a game of SimCity — in an obsolete version, no less — have to teach us about a “life out of balance”?</p>
<p>Magnasanti is, first and foremost, a study in how to game SimCity to a maximum-population win condition.</p>
<p>However, I do think it raises some intriguing questions.</p>
<p>Oscala <a href="http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-games/2010/05/10/the-totalitarian-buddhist-who-beat-sim-city/" target="_blank">comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The film presented the world in a way I never really looked at before  and that captivated me. Moments like these compel me to physically  express progressions in my thought, I have just happened to do that  through the form of creating these cities in <em>SimCity 3000.</em> I  could probably have done something similar – depicting the awesome  regimentation and brutality of our society – with a series of paintings  on a canvas, or through hideous architectural models.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But it wouldn’t be  the same as doing it in the game, for the reason that I wanted to  magnify the unbelievably sick ambitions of egotistical political  dictators, ruling elites and downright insane architects, urban planners  and social engineers.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Australian architecture blog <a href="http://supercolossal.ch/2010/10/07/pay-to-click-get-rich-quick-urbanism-and-the-ideal-simcity/" target="_blank">Super Colossal discusses</a> some of the issues provoked by Magnasanti (link <a href="http://m.ammoth.us/blog/2010/10/magnasanti/" target="_blank">via</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of archiporn that I am a sucker for; gamespace urbanism  exploited to its extreme condition. Can you ‘win’ urbanism? Is this  even urbanism? If not, can we take anything from its construction? The  primary move that the city makes is to remove cars altogether and base  transport purely on subways. I suspect this is a method to exploit the  space otherwise taken up by roads for real estate allowing for an  increased population per tile, however, it is a strategy that many  cities—Sydney included—are seriously looking into. Remove motor  vehicles, increase public transport. Seems like a sound idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to see a world in which the lack of cars exists alongside a lack of freedom, and indeed may even be symptomatic of it. Oscala has created a system so “sustainable” that citizens are chained to their city blocks; they’re able to access the rest of the city through mass transit, but in effect have been relieved of the need to do so by the ruthless efficiency of their cookie-cutter “neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>Maybe — all right, probably — this is effective because the game engine is warped. Super Colossal concludes that “Ultimately, Magnasanti has little to do with urban design and everything to do with gaming systems for maximum&nbsp;reward.”</p>
<p>I can’t help but think that Magnasanti represents a semi-realistic dark side of centralized urban planning: the tools of modern construction and city planning as wielded by a despotic madman bent on maximizing population at any cost. Creativity, vibrancy and nature itself are cast away as a focus on efficiency and the bottom line are elevated to a religion and a science.</p>
<p>And of course, the police force are ever-present, just in case disorder begins to stir.</p>
<p>As Oscala <a href="http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-games/2010/05/10/the-totalitarian-buddhist-who-beat-sim-city/" target="_blank">explained in an interview with Viceland</a>, Magnasanti represents a “cage” in which he has imprisoned six million “economic slaves”. He <a href="http://images.shareapic.net/images7/022530174.jpg" target="_blank">utilized the geometry</a> of the Buddhist Wheel of Life and Death as further symbolic comment on the topic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Technically, no one is leaving or coming into the  city. Population growth is stagnant. Sims don’t need to travel long  distances, because their workplace is just within walking distance. In  fact they do not even need to leave their own block. Wherever they go  it’s like going to the same place. </strong></p>
<p><strong>There are a lot of other problems in the city hidden under the  illusion of order and greatness: Suffocating air pollution, high  unemployment, no fire stations, schools, or hospitals, a regimented  lifestyle – this is the price that these sims pay for living in the city  with the highest population. It’s a sick and twisted goal to strive  towards. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The ironic thing about it is the sims in Magnasanti tolerate  it. They don’t rebel, or cause revolutions and social chaos. No one  considers challenging the system by physical means since a  hyper-efficient police state keeps them in line. They have all been  successfully dumbed down, sickened with poor health, enslaved and  mind-controlled just enough to keep this system going for thousands of  years. 50,000 years to be exact. They are all imprisoned in space and  time.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://m.ammoth.us/blog/2010/10/magnasanti/" target="_blank">Mammoth blog</a> calls Magnasanti “An intentionally hellish vision which exploits the game’s internal logic as commentary.”</p>
<p>Oscala <a href="http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-games/2010/05/10/the-totalitarian-buddhist-who-beat-sim-city/" target="_blank">adds </a>that “if we make maximizing profits the absolute objective, we fail to take  into consideration the social and environmental consequences.”</p>
<p><strong>At the very least, it’s delicious food for thought for would-be urban planners and simulation gamers.</strong></p>

<p>Laissez Faire Leadership is a form of leadership that offers many benefits for startups. In fact, if you currently work at a startup, you’re likely practicing a laissez-faire management style without even realizing it! In this article, we’ll briefly cover what laissez-faire leadership is and three benefits that it can bring to your startup.</p>



<h3><strong>What is Laissez Faire Leadership?</strong></h3>



<p>Laissez-faire leadership is a hands-off management style based on trust and is the direct opposite of micromanagement. Laissez-faire managers set clear visions and give their direct reports autonomy to make decisions in whatever way they best see fit.</p>



<p><em>Fun fact: </em><a href="https://www.paulallen.com/"><em>Paul Allen</em></a><em>, co-founder of </em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/"><em>Microsoft</em></a><em>, is known for taking a hands-off, or laissez-faire, approach to management. Other famous laissez-faire leaders include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett">Warren Buffett</a>, founder of Berkshire Hathaway, and <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/donna-karan-4">Donna Karan</a>, founder of DKNY.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Before we cover the advantages of laissez-faire leadership for startups, it’s worth mentioning why some are opposed to this leadership style. Those who oppose it prefer a hands-on, involved approach and wish to be closely involved in project implementations. Others find that a laissez-faire approach leads to time mismanagement, especially when there is a lack of accountability amongst team members.</p>



<p>Although those qualms are valid, we still believe that most startups would benefit from laissez-faire leadership. Next, we’ll cover the 3 biggest benefits laissez-faire leadership brings to startups.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefit 1: Empowers employee creativity</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blue-lemon.jpg" alt="Blue Lemon Creativity" srcset="https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blue-lemon.jpg 640w, https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blue-lemon-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>Laissez-faire leaders bestow trust and autonomy onto employees and give them free reign to learn through trial and error. In other words, they give their teammates goals and freedom to achieve those goals.</p>



<p>When given the freedom to make decisions, employees tend to be more creative because they aren’t simply handed a “right answer”. Creativity is important and is increasingly <a href="https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/why-creativity-is-more-important-than-ever">a competitive advantage</a> for startups, especially as they battle large incumbents like Google and Amazon. </p>



<p>Ambitious startups thrive on innovation, rapid iteration, and new ideas, making laissez-faire leadership a great fit for any fast-growing company.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefit 2: Attracts employees who thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments</strong></h3>



<p>Paul Graham <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">famously notes</a> that “a startup is a company designed to grow fast.” Employees who effectively deal with ambiguity and who are fast learners are more likely to thrive in the dynamic, fast-paced nature of startups.&nbsp;Such employees likely chose to work at startups because they thrive in unpredictable environments and wouldn’t do well with overly-prescriptive management styles.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.cadencework.com/daily-standups-asynchronous-communication/">Micromanagement has no place</a> in an environment like a startup, where growth and changes are the only constants. In such environments, micromanagers would be bottlenecks to growth, as work would be inhibited unless their directives were given. Instead, startups value resourcefulness and autonomy, two values that laissez-faire leaders encourage.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefit 3: Is </strong>suitable<strong> for remote work</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yellow.jpg" alt="Remote work keyboard" srcset="https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yellow.jpg 640w, https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yellow-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, most companies have implemented <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/07/27/google-amazon-facebook-microsoft-twitter/#bce4cb235c8b">work-from-home policies until 2021</a>. As these companies work remotely, many realize that given different working hours and timezones, it’s no longer realistic to equate online presence with productivity. Rather, the more productive approach is to focus on output and results. </p>



<p>Laissez-faire leaders empower remote teams to thrive because they don’t need to force employees to install intrusive tracking software in order to feel confident that work is getting done. Instead, they delegate, set tangible milestones, unblock teammates as necessary, and trust that they will accomplish those goals. This allows employees to execute on their current projects in whatever way works best for them.</p>



<h3><strong>Laissez-Faire Leadership is Great for Startups</strong></h3>



<p>Ultimately, laissez-faire leadership empowers employee creativity, attracts employees who thrive in fast-paced environments, and is suitable for remote work. Startups looking to differentiate themselves and stay competitive should consider implementing this style of leadership.</p>

<![CDATA[You may finally use JSHint for evil]]>

August 4, 2020 | http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/jshint-watching-the-ship-sink/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/jshint-watching-the-ship-sink/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><strong>This is the first essay in <a href="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/you-may-finally-use-jshint-for-evil/">a four-part series about relicensing the JSHint
software project</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The process of relicensing JSHint took seven years. That’s far longer than
anyone expected, but seeing this through wasn’t just a matter of endurance. As
I worked with people around the world to move to the MIT Expat license, I
regularly experienced how non-free licensing (even as seemingly trivial as
“Good, not Evil”) poisons the well of free software.</p>

<p>Some numbers might help here. The following graph shows how many times JSHint
has been downloaded from <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/">npm</a> each week over the past
five years:</p>

<p><img src="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/jshint-watching-the-ship-sink-graph-1.png" alt="JSHint downloads over time"></p>

<p>We had a dip last year, but we’ve since recovered and then some. Over half a
million downloads per week sure sounds impressive, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> impressive in 2015. The fact is, npm’s usage has exploded over the
past half decade. Holding steady in this space is actually falling behind. Take
a look at the same statistic for <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>, a truly open
source project with the same purpose and target audience as JSHint:</p>

<p><img src="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/jshint-watching-the-ship-sink-graph-2.png" alt="JSHint and ESLint downloads over time"></p>

<p>Suddenly that dip in 2019 doesn’t seem so important. How did JSHint go from
being the most popular tool in this space to one that most developers today
consider antiquated? There are many explanations, but in this essay, I’ll focus
on the effects of non-free licensing.</p>

<h3 id="for-license-sensitive-users">For license-sensitive users</h3>

<p>JSHint was partly licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#JSON">the JSON
license</a>. It is nearly
identical to the widely-used MIT Expat license, but it includes one additional
clause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of this clause, folks who respect the practice of software licensing
simply could not use JSHint.</p>

<p>If you’re not versed in legal matters, that probably seems like an odd
restriction. By rejecting JSHint, are people admitting that they want to do
evil? And is that clause actually enforceable, anyway?</p>

<p>The answer to the second question is “no,” and that helps answer the first
question. Legally-conscious objectors aren’t betraying their own dastardly
motivations; they’re refusing to enter into an ambiguous contract. Put
differently: they’re not saying, “I’m an evildoer,” they’re saying, “I don’t
understand what you want.” This consideration disqualified JSHint from
inclusion in all sorts of contexts.</p>

<p>First, there were legally-conscious software repositories. Developers from the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>
GNU/Linux distributions independently concluded that they could not include
JSHint due to licensing concerns. That’s why <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>
users can’t download JSHint via <code>sudo apt-get install jshint</code>.</p>

<p>Even in less discerning package managers, folks built tools to empower
developers to make similar decisions on their own. For instance, JSHint has
been available on <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/">npm</a> since its initial release, but
<a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX</a> (along with tools like
<a href="https://github.com/ironSource/license-report"><code>license-report</code></a> and
<a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/licenses">Yarn</a>) has since been
designed to help folks understand the legal requirements of their dependencies.
This seemed like an encouraging trend toward conscientious code sharing, so <a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/pull/2420">we
did our part by adopting SPDX in
JSHint</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, an instructor at a US university wrote to the JSHint team asking
for permission to use JSHint in their course. I replied,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By all means, you are welcome to use the project and its website in your
courses. Please note, however, that the source code is partially
published under the JSON license. The FSF does not recognize this as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">a
free software license</a> nor
does the Open Source Initiative recognize it as <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">an open source
license</a>. This detail does not
effect most people in practice, but you may want to verify with your legal
team before relying on the code base.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honesty may be the best policy, but it also means fewer people are going to use
your bizarrely-encumbered JavaScript linter.</p>

<p>Finally, programming platforms that “repackaged” JSHint have reconsidered that
practice because of the license issue. There was a time when the popular
content management system <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> repackaged JSHint
in this way. Once they learned of the JSON license, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42850">they replaced JSHint in a
matter of weeks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="for-feature-craving-users">For feature-craving users</h3>

<p>Plenty of people don’t give a fig about free software. Whatever their reason,
they couldn’t care less about the legal terms that are bundled with
publicly-available source code. The “Good, not Evil” clause also pushed them
away, even if they didn’t realize it.</p>

<p>It began with the decline in license-sensitive users. The word “user” is a bit
too passive in the context of open source tooling because folks who use the
software are particularly empowered to contribute back to it. The “user-base”
is directly correlated to the “contributor-base.” When a project like JSHint
loses users, it also loses contributors.</p>

<p>This slows the addition of new features and the correction of bugs. Timeliness
is important for these things, and people perceive delays very negatively. The
best example of this comes from JSHint’s delayed support for async functions.</p>

<p>(The async function is a JavaScript language feature which was <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-intro">introduced in
2017</a>. It’s very popular among developers
but also very difficult for parsers to implement correctly. <a href="https://jshint.com/blog/2019-02-05/release-2-10-0/">It took us over a
year to support it in
JSHint.</a>).</p>

<p>Some expressed their dissatisfaction with the delay in <a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-342173639">calm (though somewhat
impatient)
terms</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Async/await has been at stage 4 for over a month now (and baked into Node and
many mainstream browsers for longer), but jshint has yet to add support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…but others were more emotional:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-329704124">“You just lost my interest in jshint. Sorry, to [sic]
slow.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-331985362">“Thank you JSHint. It was good while it lasted. Switched to
ESLint.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-340112372">“RIP
Jshint”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-455643712">“Seems like we waited enough. Bye JSHint. It was a good
time.”</a></li>
<li>“I know that you get a lot of complaints about this, but… if you can’t find
a way to include support for async/await, jshint is useless to me. I’m
switching to just using <code>node -c &lt;filename&gt;</code>” (via e-mail)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Internet has a way of surfacing the loudest and angriest perspectives, but
it seems safe to assume there was a substantial group of less vocal developers
who came to a similar conclusion.</p>

<p>A dwindling user/contributor-base is a vicious cycle. Though the movement may
have started with license-conscious folks, everyone felt the pain of the
release cycle equally, and their exodus exacerbated the problem.</p>

<p>This isn’t just a story of open-source “market” forces, though. My own
management decisions contributed to JSHint’s dissatisfying release cycle.</p>

<p>You see, many people express their dependency on software using a range of
versions. They don’t say, “give me Firefox at version 67.02.3” because they
don’t really care about that particular release. What they want is the software
to be familiar but also secure. They’re more likely to say, “give me the latest
version of Firefox 67.” With this statement, they’re trusting the maintainers
of Firefox to provide a program that looks and acts a certain way (i.e. not
exactly like version 65 or version 68) but that also has the latest bug fixes
(so 67.02.4 is preferable to 67.02.3).</p>

<p>This practice generally benefits users and developers alike. In my case,
though, I had a conflicting personal goal: I wanted the relicensed version of
JSHint to reach as many people as possible.</p>

<p>If we made drastic improvements to JSHint, we’d have to release a new major
version. The relicensing effort could continue with the new version, but many
people would continue to use the old version. For all the obsessing I’ve done
about JSHint over the years, I haven’t forgotten that most people aren’t
particularly concerned with the release schedule of their JavaScript linter.
When and if we succeeded, the users of the old version would be cut off from
our success (not to mention the improvements we made from that point forward).</p>

<p>This consideration made me averse to drastic changes in JSHint. Pretty
antithetical for a project maintainer.</p>

<h3 id="software-freedom-matters">Software freedom matters</h3>

<p>For many people, licensing is an esoteric part of software development. It’s a
relatable opinion: the legal frameworks are intimidating, and most
considerations can be addressed by simply defaulting to well-known
free/open-source licenses.</p>

<p>The trouble is that not all software is distributed under well-known
free/open-source licenses. My hope is that the particulars of JSHint’s decay
help folks understand why licensing matters.</p>

<p>After reading the drudgery of JSHint’s slow decline, you might be wondering why
we didn’t just give up. A sinking ship is only tragic if you value the ship. If
<a href="https://eslint.org/">a newer, faster, similarly-named ship</a> sails by, then
maybe it’s time to put down the bailer. It’ll take <a href="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/jshint-dug-in/">another
essay</a> to address that fully.</p>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>

<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>

<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>

<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>

<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>

<p><span>T</span>here he was, smiling on the <a href="https://www.zinio.com/za/forbes-africa/june-2016-i18106">cover of <em>Forbes Africa</em> magazine</a>, dollar bills raining like confetti. It was June 2016, and Obinwanne Okeke, then 28, was on top of the world; he had just landed a coveted spot on the magazine’s prestigious 30 under 30 list of African entrepreneurs. In the article, he was one of many whiz kids described as “Africa’s bright young things.”</p>



<p>The 17th child of a polygamous father whose mother was the fourth wife, Okeke’s father died when he was 16, and his mother, a teacher, worked multiple jobs to put him and his siblings through school. Growing up in Ukpor, a village in southeastern Nigeria, was tough, and luxuries like sneakers or a Game Boy were hard to come by, he said in a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p065dtt3">2018 BBC interview</a>. </p>

<p>But he persevered, he said, studying in South Africa and Australia, earning a master’s degree in international relations and counter-terrorism at Monash University. He started his business in Nigeria in 2013. That business — which, as he has alluded to in other interviews, involved low-cost housing and green homes — expanded into South Africa, Botswana, and Zambia, with a potential addition in Uganda. His interests were worth almost $10 million, <a href="https://iono.fm/e/303518">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Okeke named his business Invictus, after the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus">poem</a> by William Ernest Henley about resilience in the face of adversity. It was said to be <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2013/12/morgan-freeman-masterfully-recites-nelson-mandelas-favorite-poem-invictus.html">Nelson Mandela’s favorite poem</a>.</p>



<p>“Invictus is in construction, agriculture, oil and gas, telecoms and real estate. He has 28 permanent and 100 part-time employees across nine companies,”<em> Forbes Africa</em> wrote in Okeke’s entry.</p>



<p>But that much-lauded business empire existed alongside Okeke’s criminal enterprises, the FBI later wrote in an August 2019 <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.450919/gov.uscourts.vaed.450919.5.0_1.pdf">affidavit</a>. Turns out, Okeke had been involved in a string of sophisticated online scams since at least 2015 — including when he was gracing that glossy <em>Forbes Africa</em> cover. He <a href="https://www.thecable.ng/fbi-arrested-invictus-obi-at-dulles-international-airport-just-before-escaping-us">was arrested</a> at Dulles International Airport, Virginia, on August 6, 2019, for defrauding a company of nearly $11 million. He <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/nigerian-businessman-pleads-guilty-11-million-fraud-scheme">pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy to commit wire fraud on June 18, 2020, and now faces up to 20 years in prison at his sentencing in October. Okeke’s rapid ascent as a supposedly successful entrepreneur —&nbsp;and his subsequent defenestration — reflects a growing trend in online scamming known as <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/business-email-compromise-(bec)">business email compromise (BEC)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The tale of</strong> the Nigerian online scammers <a href="https://republic.com.ng/august-september-2019/yahoo-yahoo-naija/">stretches back to the 1990s</a>, when cybercafes sprung up across the country as internet access became increasingly widespread. Young men popularly known as “<a href="https://theconversation.com/meet-the-yahoo-boys-nigerias-undergraduate-conmen-60757">Yahoo boys</a>” became famous for conning their unsuspecting victims out of money by posing as romantic interests — typically American soldiers based in active conflict zones in the Middle East —&nbsp;or as wealthy royals in need of help getting a relative’s money out of some bureaucratic logjam. Their notoriety is now mainstream enough that they’ve become a pop-culture joke. In an <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/01/black-ish-recap-season-2-episode-12.html">episode from the second season</a> of the TV show “Black-ish<em>,</em>” a concerned sibling chastised her brother about his potential love interest, convinced he was being duped by a scammer. “This is a middle-aged Nigerian man who wants your money or your kidney,” she told him. The youngest sibling added, “I’m trusting to a fault, and even I know this screams Nigerian scam.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okeke’s case reflects how much has changed since then.<strong> </strong>Rather than settling for petty romance schemes, some scammers are now targeting the email accounts of executives at Western<strong> </strong>companies, tricking their companies into sending wire transfers to supposed overseas suppliers who then fraudulently transfer those funds into the scammers’ bank accounts. The stakes involved in BECs are high in nearly every possible way: they target wealthy and prominent victims and use complex tools to defraud them, and if the plot succeeds, it results in a windfall. Whereas the targets of online romance scams are usually older Americans or other lonely Westerners desperate for affection (or the occasional naïf fooled into going into business with a <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/nigerian-prince-scam-social-engineering/">seemingly sweet-talking African prince</a>), email compromise focuses on businesses ranging from small-sized enterprises to multinational corporations. Scammers typically single out high-level executives, usually the CEO, CFO, or COO, “the real decision-makers who have the power to sign checks and grant approval,” Eniola Fadare, a Lagos-based computer security expert, told <em>Rest of World</em>. The goal, after gaining control of these decision-makers’ email accounts, is to authorize wire payments of money that will largely end up in accounts controlled by the scammers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast to romance scams, where the guys — and they’re almost always guys — find their marks on Facebook, Instagram, or any number of dating apps, email compromise is a “patient scam,” Fadare said, that involves quietly shadowing a company or its executives for months, to determine the types of businesses they’re involved in and the vendors who will need to be paid. The operational costs of pulling off one of these scams often add up to millions of naira, but the payoff can be worth it. While romance scammers may make off with anywhere from $350 to $3,000, BEC scammers can potentially rake in much more. Olalekan Jacob Ponle, who also went by the name Mr. Woodbery, was arrested on June 10, 2020, in Dubai for allegedly <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/nigerian-national-expelled-united-arab-emirates-face-cyber-fraud-charge-chicago">stealing $15.2 million</a> in a scam targeting a Chicago-based company.</p>



<p>BEC involves a high degree of sophistication and collaboration between masterminds and co-conspirators, who provide services like designing fake landing pages for hijacking email accounts and harvesting passwords. There are also money mules who provide accounts, sometimes referred to as “houses,” to park the proceeds of the scams. A 24-year-old Lagos-based scammer, who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> through an intermediary to preserve his anonymity, said that romance scams are “easier and cheaper to do” than BEC scams. But they’re not the sure bet they once were, because of how widespread they are. “People are getting educated and enlightened,” Fadare said.</p>



<p>Business-related scams involve individuals spread around the world, requiring authorities to cooperate across borders; Mr. Woodbery was extradited to the United States after being captured by Dubai police. Last year, 281 individuals, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/281-arrested-worldwide-coordinated-international-enforcement-operation-targeting-hundreds">including 167 in Nigeria</a>, were arrested for their involvement in BEC schemes as part of an international raid called Operation reWired. Arrests were also made in Turkey, Japan, Italy, and elsewhere. The cases are being tried across several jurisdictions in the U.S., because the victims are American.</p>



<p>In a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California on the arrest of Hushpuppi, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hushpuppi/">flamboyant Instagram</a> celebrity with 2.5 million followers, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/nigerian-national-brought-us-face-charges-conspiring-launder-hundreds-millions-dollars">described</a> BEC as “one of the most difficult cybercrimes we encounter as they typically involve a coordinated group of con artists scattered around the world who have experience with computer hacking and exploiting the international financial system.” Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, claimed that the FBI recorded $1.7 billion lost to BEC schemes in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>The crime that</strong> got Okeke arrested began on April 1, 2018, making it perhaps the most lucrative prank ever pulled on April Fool’s Day. The victim was Unatrac Holding Ltd, the export sales office of a dealer for Caterpillar, a heavy industrial and farm equipment company. The company is based in Slough, a town about 45 minutes outside of London. According to the FBI statement, Unatrac’s CFO received an email containing a login link for his Microsoft Office 365 account and entered his login details, believing it to be real. Instead, it was a spoof website crafted by Okeke and unnamed associates to gain access to the CFO’s email. </p>



<p>After they did, the hackers sent invoices from an email address intended to mimic that of a legitimate vendor to the CFO’s email, using invoice templates and logos found within the compromised account to lend an air of legitimacy to the documents. Minutes later, those fake invoices were forwarded to Unatrac’s finance team from the CFO’s email. Because the finance staff had no reason to doubt the provenance of the wire transfer requests, they processed about 15 payments between April 11 and April 19, 2018. The company that allegedly submitted the invoices, Pak Fei Trade Ltd, was sent at least three payments that totaled more than $3 million, with the payments going to overseas accounts. In total, almost $11 million was stolen from Unatrac.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the same time the scam was underway, Okeke <a href="https://guardian.ng/news/nigerian-investment-expert-to-speak-at-lse-africa-summit-in-london/">was an invited speaker</a> at the London School of Economics’s Africa Summit, alongside luminaries like Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo and many other prominent African businesspeople. He also partook in that BBC interview, telling tales of growing up poor and how he was introducing low-income housing to a Nigerian property market saturated with expensive homes.</p>



<p>By the time the company realized it had been hoodwinked, it was too late to cancel the transactions, and little of the funds were recovered, according to the FBI statement. To avoid detection, the hackers set up email filters that immediately intercepted legitimate emails to and from the CFO, marked them as read, and moved them to another folder outside the inbox.</p>



<p>Fadare, the security expert, explained that, in conjunction with setting up email filters, scammers do not work “at active hours when they know the CEO is awake or busy.”</p>



<p>Additionally, “they clear the emails from the boxes as soon as they’re received. The real CEO, when he logs into his email, is not going to see anything,” he added. Fadare said scammers bank on people not carefully scrutinizing messages …</p></div></div>

		<p>Imagine tomorrow you go shopping and, for whatever reason, you never come back. Maybe be someone killed you, maybe someone kidnapped you, maybe you had an accident ... Now imagine you are travelling alone in Thailand and you die. How people who know you are going to find out what happen ? if you are being kidnaped how the police will do to find you, if you got lost how people will find you ? If you die how your family is going to find your papers ?</p>
<p>I wanted to find a way to answer all those questions, basically we can sum up the issues in 3 points :
- In case of being kidnaped or getting lost send as much information on your last location, and following locations, your last activity, all your digital information to someone who is going to help liberating you
- In case of dying, sending all your documents (passwords, friends list, legal documents, ...) to your family
- Not sending those documents by mistakes if you are not on the situations above</p>
<h2>First step : collect your position, your activity, your documents, ...</h2>
<p>The first step is to be sure that you have the data that you want to send, on my part, the data are:</p>
<ol>
<li>My current position and recent history</li>
<li>My last know activity and a recent history</li>
<li>The list of my credentials</li>
<li>The list of my legal documents (id, passport, health insurance, work papers, ...)</li>
</ol>
<p>I've written an <a href="https://blog.luap.info/how-i-track-my-life.html">article</a> explaining how I'm doing 1. and 2. (position in real time, and last activity), so this is fixed.</p>
<p>For my credentials, I use <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">keepassXC</a> with a keyfile + a master password, the keyfile and the password db is synced using <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthingd</a> with a server that I rent</p>
<p>My legal documents are all tied in one folder on my laptop which is also synced on the same server</p>
<p>So basically we have all the needed documents which are synced in real time on the same server</p>
<h2>Second step : Choose how to trigger the sharing of documents</h2>
<p>The biggest problem is you want the alert to react quickly but not fire because you have been sleeping for 8 hours. So I chose to rely on the time since I last changed of activity. Currently after 24h without changing activity a first notification is sent to my own email so that if this is a mistake I can stop the system before it is too late. And if 6 hours later I've still haven't changed of activity then a mail is sent to my parents.</p>
<p>So basically if something happens to me my parents will be notified maximum 30h after the event, this is not so great but this is a good beginning. In the future I should try to have an adaptive delay depending on the last activity, for example if my last activity is eating, then I won't eat for 24 hours, so I can trigger the alert after for example 4 hours.</p>
<h2>Last step : What to put inside the notification</h2>
<p>So my parents will receive an email after 30 hours of inactivity. In this email there is a link to a page which will allow them to retrieve all the documents.
<img alt="email" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/kidnap/email.png"></p>
<p>The link is random generated link available only 6 hours, this is important to be safe as you don't want anyone to be able to access all your passwords ...</p>
<p>And the page, there are explanations of that page is about, like, "maybe I was kidnaped, maybe I'm lost, check my last time active on whatsapp, contact xxxx to see if he knows anything"
You can also view the current position of my phone and a small location history, that way you can see if I'm still moving, or if the last point if 30 hours old, you can also see my last activity and when it started</p>
<p>And finally you can get the list of all my passwords, for that purpose I created a form, with 6 facts on my life, that only my parents can know all of them, like what was the color of my first car ..., then there you can submit your answer, there is a rate limit on the number of requests you can make to prevent a brute force. If the 6 answers are true, the backend will decode the keepassxc archive and return a json of the archive, containing all of my credentials, including the ssh password to connect on the server to get all the paper documents.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I know that all of that is far from being perfect. I check every few months that the alerting is working, by decreasing the delay to trigger the alert, but the server can go down, ton of things can happen to make the system not working, so that's why I tried to keep everything as simple as possible, postgresql + django + cron. Someone should create a service to manage that at a bigger scale, or maybe that's something that 1password or others could include in their offer</p>

<p>– Hey, Markus! What format is this head-rotation representation in?</p>
<p>– It is a rotation matrix, I answer. Right handed, z forward through the nose and x through the left ear. Our young newly graduated colleague nods his/her head.</p>
<p>After about 10 minutes I hear my name again.</p>
<p>– Markus…. Eh, what order is it?</p>
<p>– Oh no! You have opened Wikipedia? Haven’t you? I answer in despair from my desk.</p>
<p>It happens time to time that a newly graduated engineer (or summer intern) asks me exactly this question. Almost always with the Wikipedia page open at the screen, which I think is horrible (or even worse, some “Learn OpenGL” tutorial).</p>
<p>I <s>steal</s> take a chair to sit down beside the person. This will take a few minutes, we are going to do something that is harder than learning: we are going to unlearn.</p>
<p>It is interesting, I get no questions, or only very short questions, on Euler angels, Rodriguez rotations and actually only one recurrent question on quaternions. But very often I get questions on rotation matrices. I think it is a bit odd since rotation matrices are very simple in comparison to many other rotation representations. I think a big reason for this is the Wikipedia page. It looks something like this:</p>
<p>
\[
R_x(\theta) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos \theta &amp;  -\sin \theta \\
0 &amp; \sin \theta  &amp;  \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
R_y(\theta) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; 0 &amp; \sin \theta \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin \theta &amp; 0 &amp; \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
R_z(\theta) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp;  -\sin \theta &amp; 0 \\
\sin \theta &amp;   \cos \theta &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\alpha\cos\beta &amp; \cos\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma - \sin\alpha\cos\gamma &amp; \cos\alpha\sin\beta\cos\gamma + \sin\alpha\sin\gamma \\
\sin\alpha\cos\beta &amp; \sin\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma + \cos\alpha\cos\gamma &amp; \sin\alpha\sin\beta\cos\gamma - \cos\alpha\sin\gamma \\
-\sin\beta &amp; \cos\beta\sin\gamma &amp; \cos\beta\cos\gamma \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
</p>
<p>It talks about rotations. Rotation around different axes and their relation to Euler angles. This can be a bit confusing when working with for example a head pose. You can of course think about rotation matrices as if the head rotates around different axes in different order, but it becomes kind of hard to interpret:</p>
<p>
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
 -0.9987820 &amp; 0.0348782 &amp; -0.0348995 \\
  0.0283128 &amp; 0.9844193 &amp;  0.1735424 \\
  0.0404086 &amp; 0.1723429 &amp; -0.9842078
\end{bmatrix}
\]
</p>
<p>So to interpret this we need to solve the following equation system:</p>
<p>
\[
\begin{cases}
-\sin(\beta) &amp; = 0.0404086 \\
\cos(\beta)\sin(\gamma) &amp; = 0.1723429 \\
\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) &amp; = -0.9987820
\end{cases}
\]
</p>
<p>and then we get an <em>“intrinsic rotation whose Tait–Bryan angles are α, β, γ, about axes z, y, x”</em> to visualize in our head.</p>
<p>Its sad because I think rotation matrices are one of the easiest representation to interpret.</p>
<p>Don’t think of them as rotations, think of them as a unit vectors of a new coordinate systems.</p>
<p><img src="https://kodkodgames.gitlab.io/post/matrix_cs.png#center" alt="plot of the coordinate system"></p>
<p>We describe where the coordinate system is located related to another coordinate system (where we rotate from), for example from the camera’s coordinate system perspective (z forward, y upwards). The first column of the rotation matrix is the new x-axis expressed in the old coordinate system, the second column is the y-axis and so on. An identity matrix would yield in no rotation since all unit vectors would be the same as the previous coordinate system.</p>
<p>
\[
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
  X_x &amp; Y_x &amp; Z_x \\
  X_y &amp; Y_y &amp;  Z_y \\
  X_z &amp; Y_z &amp; Z_z
\end{bmatrix}
\]
</p> 
<p>Lets go back to the example with the head expressed in the camera coordinate system and assume the head position is atfront of the camera. So by interpret the previous matrix, we can look at the new z-axis:</p>
<p>
\[
Z_{axis} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
Z_x \\
Z_y \\
Z_z
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-0.0348995 \\
0.1735424 \\
-0.9842078
\end{bmatrix}
\]
</p>
<p>(Remember that z-axis is where the head’s nose is pointing)</p>
<p>We can quickly see that z-part of the z-axis is almost -1. This means the nose is pointing at the opposite direction as the camera, eg. towards the camera if the person is sitting at front of it.</p>
<p>We can also se that the persons head is rotated a little bit up (positive y component of the z-axis) and is pointing a little bit to the right of the camera (negative x component).</p>
<p>And that’s it! Rotation matrices just describe the unit vectors of a new coordinate system.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>– Hey, Markus! How come this matrix is 4x4?</p>

<p>We were pleased when <a href="https://opencrux.com/">Crux</a> was included in the
ThoughtWorks
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/crux">technology radar</a>
with a recommendation to <strong>assess</strong>:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Crux is an open-source document database with bitemporal graph
queries…​ it’s currently in alpha and lacks SQL support, but you can
use a Datalog query interface for reading and traversing
relationships.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>We are fans of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a> and the
power it gives. Although it’s not directly compatible and may drift
out further, we’ve based our Datalog query API on
<a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query">Datomic’s</a>, where Datalog
is represented as a pattern-matching declarative data-structure.</p>
<p>Datalog is easy to construct and parse and it is natural to make use
of custom predicates and rules as part of the logical pattern
matching.</p>
<p>We love Datalog, but it’s also fair to say that a sizeable chunk of
potential users will want to use SQL. Be it for users who want to run
ad-hoc SQL queries without needing to know Datalog, or for integration
between systems where SQL is the lingua franca, it’s important that we
support it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_code_crux_sql_code"><a href="#_code_crux_sql_code"></a><code>crux-sql</code></h2>
<div>
<p>We have created a new <code>crux-sql</code> module in Crux which makes use of the
<a href="https://calcite.apache.org/">Apache Calcite</a> SQL query planning engine. Calcite
is a powerful library for exposing SQL queries against arbitrary data-sources
and has been integrated with a variety of DBMSs such as Cassandra, Mongo and
Elastic, as well as Big Data systems like Hive, Drill, Flink and Dremio.</p>
<p>Calcite has been around for a long while and is still very
active. We’re grateful for the work the Calcite team have put into
this tool and the power it gives, as well as the friendly community that
has built up around it.</p>
<p>We run Calcite in-process as part of a Crux node, so there’s no need
to set up any additional infrastructure. Rather you just need to add
the <code>crux-sql</code> module dependency:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">[juxt/crux-sql "RELEASE"]]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>We have integrated Calcite such that SQL queries are translated to
efficient Datalog queries, including sorts and inner joins.</p>
<p>You can avoid the relatively small overhead of preparing queries by
using PreparedStatements.</p>
<p>Please visit the
<a href="https://github.com/juxt/crux/blob/master/crux-sql/README.adoc">module
README</a> for how to get going with some simple steps, or please watch
this video:</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HEBL_ue2wbw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>crux-sql</code> module allows for both in-process SQL queries and for
remote JDBC queries using
<a href="https://calcite.apache.org/avatica/">Avatica</a>. This is covered in the
docs.</p>

<p>Does your company have a culture of letting everyone see each other’s calendars? Do people often schedule meetings whenever there are openings, without asking?</p>



<p>If so, your calendar is a blocklist. The only time that isn’t available for someone to steal is time that’s already spoken for. This is a problem. A time slot that isn’t currently booked shouldn’t be free real estate. That’s my TIME! You can’t just take it without asking.</p>



<p>Instead, your calendars should be an allowlist. You should say “if you want to talk to me, this is when you can” instead of “this is when you CAN’T.” You shouldn’t have to defend our time like it’s gold and your coworkers are pirates. You should just assume that it’s yours to spend how you see fit.</p>



<p>Some people block time off to try to protect their calendars. They create big “GTD” blocks on their calendar and hope that nobody books meetings on top of them. I’ve even heard of people creating fake or vague meeting titles in hopes that others will assume there’s a real meeting at that time. This is a crappy workaround, and it isn’t enough. </p>



<p>The solution should be office hours. You should be able to say say “I’m free for meetings from 2-5pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and if you want to talk to me then that’s when you can.” In most companies, doing that would make you an annoyance. Those companies don’t respect Deep Work. </p>



<p>Scheduling meetings should be a little bit painful. You should have to really want it. You should be forced to question yourself. <em>Is this actually worth me going to the trouble of figuring out how to schedule this meeting? Or could it instead be an asynchronous discussion? </em>Office hours and calendars-as-allowlists have this added benefit.</p>



<p>Is your calendar an allowlist or a blocklist?</p>

It’s that simple.”</p><p id="viewer-8vmcf">“Stay at MSNBC at least until the midterms,” Jeffrey said a couple years back.  He advised to watch and see what happens.</p><p id="viewer-ekaih">“Hang in there… you’re needed,” Elizabeth recommended last winter.  “I was in your shoes when I was younger but I stuck it out.”</p><p id="viewer-bvvpg">A year and a half ago, simply quitting my job without knowing my next step sounded pretty radical.  So I stuck it out a bit longer until we were in the middle of a pandemic to make a truly radical move.  </p><p id="viewer-dj9sj">July 24th was my last day at MSNBC.  I don’t know what I’m going to do next exactly but I simply couldn’t stay there anymore.  My colleagues are very smart people with good intentions.  The problem is the job itself.  It forces skilled journalists to make bad decisions on a daily basis.  </p><p id="viewer-fl8l2">You may not watch MSNBC but just know that this problem still affects you, too.  All the commercial networks function the same – and no doubt that content seeps into your social media feed, one way or the other.</p><p id="viewer-4g127">It’s possible that I’m more sensitive to the editorial process due to my background in public radio, where no decision I ever witnessed was predicated on how a topic or guest would “rate.”  The longer I was at MSNBC, the more I saw such choices — it’s practically baked in to the editorial process – and those decisions affect news content every day.  Likewise, it’s taboo to discuss how the ratings scheme distorts content, or it’s simply taken for granted, because everyone in the commercial broadcast news industry is doing the exact same thing.  </p><p id="viewer-9c0ji">But behind closed doors, industry leaders will admit the damage that’s being done.</p><p id="viewer-5n5uh">“We are a cancer and there is no cure,” a successful and insightful TV veteran said to me.  “But if you could find a cure, it would change the world.”</p><p id="viewer-39g2k">As it is, this cancer stokes national division, even in the middle of a civil rights crisis.  The model blocks diversity of thought and content because the networks have incentive to amplify fringe voices and events, at the expense of others… all because it pumps up the ratings. </p><p id="viewer-a2lh5">This cancer risks human lives, even in the middle of a pandemic.  The primary focus quickly became what Donald Trump was doing (poorly) to address the crisis, rather than the science itself.  As new details have become available about antibodies, a vaccine, or how COVID actually spreads, producers still want to focus on the politics.  Important facts or studies get buried.</p><p id="viewer-d6q8h">This cancer risks our democracy, even in the middle of a presidential election.  Any discussion about the election usually focuses on Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, a repeat offense from 2016 (Trump smothers out all other coverage).  Also important is to ensure citizens can vote by mail this year, but I’ve watched that topic get ignored or “killed” numerous times.</p><p id="viewer-k0ik">Context and factual data are often considered too cumbersome for the audience.  There may be some truth to that (our education system really should improve the critical thinking skills of Americans) – but another hard truth is that it is the job of journalists to teach and inform, which means they might need to figure out a better way to do that.  They could contemplate more creative methods for captivating an audience.  Just about anything would improve the current process, which can be pretty rudimentary (think basing today’s content on whatever rated well yesterday, or look to see what’s trending online today).</p><p id="viewer-a360v">Occasionally, the producers will choose to do a topic or story without regard for how they think it will rate, but that is the exception, not the rule.  Due to the simple structure of the industry – the desire to charge more money for commercials, as well as the ratings bonuses that top-tier decision-makers earn – they always relapse into their old profitable programming habits.</p><p id="viewer-3haev">I understand that the journalistic process is largely subjective and any group of individuals may justify a different set of priorities on any given day.  Therefore, it’s particularly notable to me, for one, that nearly every rundown at the network basically is the same, hour after hour.  And two, they use this subjective nature of the news to justify economically beneficial decisions.  I’ve even heard producers deny their role as journalists.  A very capable senior producer once said: “Our viewers don’t really consider us the news.  They come to us for comfort.”</p><p id="viewer-a1lqp">Again, personally, I don’t think the people need to change.  I think the job itself needs to change.  There is a better way to do this.  I’m not so cynical to think that we are absolutely doomed (though we are on that path).  I know we can find a cure.  If we can figure how to send a man to the moon, if Alex Trebek can defy the odds with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, and if Harry Reid can actually overcome pancreatic cancer (he’s now cancer free), then we can fix this, too. </p><p id="viewer-2jvfe">“Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”</p><p id="viewer-evref">I know James Baldwin wasn’t thinking about MSNBC when he wrote that line in 1962, but those words spoke loudly to me in the summer of 2020.  Unfortunately, many of the same ailments are still at stake today.  Now maybe we can’t really change the inherently broken structure of broadcast news, but I know for certain that it won’t change unless we actually face it, in public, and at least try to change it. </p><p id="viewer-9pbe9">Through this pandemic and the surreal, alienating lockdown, I’ve witnessed many people question their lives and what they’re doing with their time on this planet.  I reckon I’m one of those people, looking for greater meaning and truth.  As much as I love my life in New York City and really don’t want to leave, I feel fortunate to be able to return to Virginia in the near term to reconnect with family, friends, and a community of independent journalists.  I’m both nervous and excited about this change.  Thanks to COVID-19, I’m learning to live with uncertainty. </p><p id="viewer-2bttl">And so very soon, I’m going to be seeking you out, any one of you who also may sense that the news is fundamentally flawed and is frustrated by it.  This effort will start informally but I hope to crystallize a plan for when better, safer days are upon us.  On that front, feel free to reach out anytime if you would like to discuss any of this – whether in agreement or not.  More than ever, I’m craving a full and civil discourse. </p><p id="viewer-ei74m">Until next time, thank you for reading.  I wish you all well.</p><p id="viewer-56pls">Ariana</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/freakwave.jpg" alt="Freak wave"></p>

<p>During the pandemic, I’ve done my civic duty and spent lockdown reading a ton of random stuff on the internet. In the midst of a Wikipedia binge, I went down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave">rogue waves</a>: massive waves that occur in the middle of the ocean, endangering ships and generating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu4ogCy5d4k">kickass Youtube content</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of a rogue wave reminded me of a particularly challenging stage in the life of many venture-backed enterprise SaaS startups. Similar to how a rogue wave forms, during this phase many Small Problems coincide and create a Big Problem. Also like rogue waves, this moment in the life of a high-growth enterprise SaaS business is uncommon – it seems to occur around $5-20 million ARR, which relatively few companies reach, and can seem almost mythical. And finally, the effects of both rogue waves and this challenging startup stage are predictable: if you spend long enough on the high seas, they’re waiting for you.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this phenomenon both in-person as an operator and as an observer of other companies, and I do believe it’s real. I’m writing this essay in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share what I’ve seen</li>
  <li>Provide some opinions on what you can do about it</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully I can be the crusty old mariner bringing back tales that others find useful.</p>

<h2 id="hitting-the-wall">Hitting the Wall</h2>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/boat.jpg" alt="Big boat, bigger wave">
Startups can be stressful</p>

<p>The rogue wave typically seems to hit between $5M and $20M in ARR. If you’re operating with a common venture-backed SaaS model of <a href="https://www.saastr.com/how-to-figure-out-your-competitors-revenues-in-about-70-seconds/">$1-200k ARR per employee</a>, this is around where you’ll hit the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships">Dunbar number</a> of ~150 people: the point where you can no longer operate as a large family, and need to start acting like a corporation. <em>(Note that the post linked is from 2012 – SaaS has since exploded, and more companies are raising huge rounds and hiring more on less revenue)</em></p>

<p>Crossing the 150-person barrier is both operationally and emotionally difficult:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operational: We have so many teams, we need regular status reports!</li>
  <li>Emotional: Why do I need to send <em>you</em> a status report all of a sudden, I thought we were all friends here?!</li>
</ul>

<p>This transition point is also when many leaders who excelled in scrappy startup mode <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/06/27/hardest-part-of-startup-scale-yourself.html">struggle to level up</a> in a larger organization. Some successfully scale themselves (slow, painful) and others will leave the company (fast, but often even more painful).</p>

<p>Many of the first contracts that you closed post-traction come up for renewal around this point (in the enterprise – SMB SaaS has less predictable growth profiles). If you’re following a <a href="https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/">triple-triple-double-double-double</a> growth path, you’ll be at roughly your second triple. There will be too many customers for the founding team to personally visit and retain everyone.</p>

<p>At this point you’ll need to renew “real” customers, not just friends who took a flyer on your infant product. These aren’t the earliest adopters who will be with you through thick and thin and are really closer to partners. These are real live paying customers who will leave if your product is screwed up. As these renewals approach, a mature post-sales motion becomes essential.</p>

<p>The expectations around your revenue also become more real at this stage. Under about $10M ARR, your revenue projections can be a mild shitshow. But the expectation that you’ll have at least some semblance of predictability steadily increases.</p>

<p>And through it all you need to continue to scale the product. Your code is no longer a series of never-ending green fields rolling off into the distance, and non-trivial parts of your product will need to be meaningfully restructured. You’re burdened by decisions made years ago, often by people who are no longer on the team.</p>

<p>This is especially true for enterprise SaaS. Enterprise products are much more unwieldy than jewel-box consumer products, as they have to support many more users and workflows. Consumer products are like Chipotle: a small, carefully curated set of menu items, built for elegance and efficiency. Enterprise products are like the Cheesecake Factory: you can get steak, pasta, a milkshake and 4 kinds of margarita in the same meal. You need to level up how your team builds products.</p>

<h2 id="cresting-the-wave">Cresting the Wave</h2>

<p>I’m writing about this phenomenon because if you haven’t seen or heard about it, there isn’t really a good way to realize that it might be coming. Even if it isn’t preventable, it’s better to know what’s on the horizon. After all, being able to see around corners is why many companies hire experienced operators.</p>

<p>I won’t claim to be an expert on how to react, but I can share a few things that I think work well and a few that don’t, and what I would do if I had to go through this phase again.</p>

<h3 id="the-crew">The Crew</h3>

<p>First, I would do my best to get the right team in place in advance. In particular, I would make sure that I had very strong functional heads for the functions that will be strained the most: Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, and Customer Success. You don’t need every role covered, but it saves headaches to know that some parts of the team are bulletproof. This isn’t the time for unforced errors.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/pirate-crew.jpg" alt="Pirates of the Caribbean crew">
You want a senior crew. You can tell that Sharkman here has experience and won’t freak out when the database goes down or a large account churns.</p>

<p>I also recommend hiring senior team members who can help see around corners and anticipate issues. This is a taxing time period because it’s so damn busy, and raw, well-directed horsepower tends to carry the day in those situations. More importantly, seasoned operators have typically seen challenging times before, and have the composure to handle them calmly because they know that things are always on fire.</p>

<p>It’s tempting during these busy times to make very junior hires such as new college graduates or coding bootcamp grads just to put butts in seats. These folks can be excellent hires in calmer times, but the chaos caused by too many inexperienced employees is very difficult while you’re cresting the wave.</p>

<h3 id="steering-the-ship">Steering the Ship</h3>

<p>Startups are generally fairly stressful, and that’s heightened in this time period. When operational problems strike in stressful times, it’s common to blame the people involved rather than processes – in reality, bad processes or incentives are usually the root cause.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the faster you’re growing, the more lightweight your processes should be. When you’re in rapid scaling mode your operational tempo is constantly changing, so there’s no point boiling the ocean to create a perfect process when next month so much will have changed.</p>

<p>For example: when confronting a startup rogue wave, I would not choose to reinvent a completely new system for launching new features. Instead, use 20% of the time to set up a simple, predictable process that gives you 80% of the value. Example: set up a recurring check-in meeting where upcoming releases are discussed by PMs and Tech Leads + a Slack thread where all new releases are announced when they go-live. It won’t be perfect, but you can get this up and running in 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="commit">Commit</h3>

<p>This is not the time to hedge your decisions or waffle on strategy.</p>

<p>For example: in general, I prefer to give people a generous window of time to grow into stretch roles. Promoting from within builds continuity, leads to a more invested team, and motivates others by demonstrating that you’re creating strong career paths. But in this phase it’s especially important that you commit to keeping or replacing leaders fast, as there’s just too much going on.</p>

<p>If you’re 30% of the way up a 100 foot wall of water and decide to adjust course, you’re going to get slammed.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-calm">Keeping Calm</h3>

<p>Whatever you do, <em>don’t freak out</em>. When it feels like shit is hitting the fan everywhere, it’s easy to want to react and search for magic solutions. Hire a new Head of X! Spend less! No wait, spend <em>more</em>! Pause development and focus on tech debt! Actually our largest customer needs more features, cancel all tech debt projects!</p>

<p>In reality, to take a line from The Sopranos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_po7So0MKq4">it won’t be cinematic</a>. Life isn’t a movie. There are no magic fixes – this challenging phase gets resolved by showing up and executing in an unflashy way for months. Magic fixes never really exist, and that’s especially true since this crucible stems from several medium-sized problems amplifying one another.</p>

<p>Searching for a unified solution to your troubles risks distraction. The road is reasonably straightforward and the challenges are tractable: there are just a lot of them. Just like an actual rogue wave, you can’t flee or dodge the factors that make crossing these rogue waves so difficult. You succeed by pointing your boat right at the problem and hitting the gas. Keeping calm doesn’t mean being stubborn or refusing to change, but it does mean that you can’t second guess your decisions – especially when it feels like you’re climbing a wall of water.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Not everyone makes it over the wave – of the roughly 10 cases that I’ve observed, roughly half had their growth stunted for at least several years after hitting this stage. In my opinion this SaaS rogue wave should be taken seriously.</p>

<p>But the good news is that once you’ve crossed the wave, you can speed up again. As you’re rising up the wall everything goes into slow motion; but once you’ve crested the top, your acceleration can increase again as you’ve set yourself up with a more stable operating model and a hardened team.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful time, as there’s so much opportunity. Your team is still in place. The market opportunity is there, and people are buying. And once you’re over the top, the water is much calmer towards the horizon.</p>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many challenging situations tend to arise simultaneously when high growth enterprise SaaS companies hit roughly $5-20 million ARR.</li>
  <li>The good news is that after this phase things get easier – the bad news is that it’s not easily avoidable.</li>
  <li>The best way to move forward is to focus on executing – and don’t be overly reactive.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’m pleased to announce the availability of the first release of <a href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde">SIMD
Everywhere</a> (SIMDe),
<a href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde/releases">version 0.5.0</a>,
representing more than three years of work by over a dozen developers.</p>

<p>SIMDe is a permissively-licensed (MIT) header-only library which
provides fast, portable implementations of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a> intrinsics for platforms
which aren’t natively supported by the API in question.</p>

<p>For example, with SIMDe you can use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a> on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_POWER_instruction_set_architecture">POWER</a>,
<a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, or almost any platform with a
C compiler.  That includes, of course, x86 CPUs which don’t support
the ISA extension in question (<em>e.g.</em>, calling AVX-512F functions on a
CPU which doesn’t natively support them).</p>

<p>If the target natively supports the SIMD extension in question there
is no performance penalty for using SIMDe.  Otherwise, accelerated
implementations, such as NEON on ARM, AltiVec on POWER, WASM SIMD on
WebAssembly, etc., are used when available to provide good
performance.</p>

<p>SIMDe has already been used to port several packages to additional
architectures through either upstream support or distribution
packages, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SIMDEverywhere">particularly on
Debian</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to play with SIMDe online, you can do so <a href="https://simde.netlify.app/godbolt/demo">on Compiler
Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-in-050">What is in 0.5.0</h2>

<p>The 0.5.0 release is SIMDe’s first release.  It includes complete
implementations of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MMX</li>
  <li>SSE</li>
  <li>SSE2</li>
  <li>SSE3</li>
  <li>SSSE3</li>
  <li>SSE4.1</li>
  <li>AVX</li>
  <li>FMA</li>
  <li>GFNI</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have rapidly progressing implementations of many other
extensions including NEON, AVX2, SVML, and several AVX-512 extensions
(AVX-512F, AVX-512BW, AVX-512VL, etc.).</p>

<p>Additionally, we have an extensive test suite to verify our
implementations.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-coming-next">What is coming next</h2>

<p>Work on SIMDe is proceeding rapidly, but there are a lot of functions
to implement… x86 alone has about 6,000 SIMD functions, and we’ve
implemented about 2,000 of them.  We will keep adding more functions
and improving the implementations we already have.</p>

<p>Our NEON implementation is being worked on very actively right now
by Sean Maher and Christopher Moore, and is expected to continue
progressing rapidly.</p>

<p>We currently have two Google Summer of Code students working on the
project as well; <a href="https://masterchef2209.wordpress.com/2020/06/17/guide-to-intel-sse4-2-crc-intrinisics-implementation-for-simde/">Hidayat
Khan</a>
is working on finishing up AVX2, and <a href="https://medium.com/@himanshi18037">Himanshi
Mathur</a> is focused on SVML.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in using SIMDe but need some specific functions
to be implemented first, please <a href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde/issues/new">file an
issue</a> and we may
be able to prioritize those functions.</p>

<h2 id="getting-involved">Getting Involved</h2>

<p>If you’re interested in helping out please get in touch.  We have <a href="https://gitter.im/simd-everywhere/community">a
chat room on Gitter</a>
which is fairly active if you have questions, or of course you can
just dive right in on <a href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde/issues">the issue
tracker</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A new skyscraper –</strong> <strong>or two – thrusts itself up into the skies of Vauxhall-Nine Elms every year, it seems. It may be hard to imagine now, writes Andrew Rogers, but for the final third of the last millennium, the area’s skyline hardly changed at all. </strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nine-Elms-Cold-Store-Richard-Gallon.png" alt="" srcset="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nine-Elms-Cold-Store-Richard-Gallon.png 939w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nine-Elms-Cold-Store-Richard-Gallon-300x218.png 300w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nine-Elms-Cold-Store-Richard-Gallon-768x559.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px"><figcaption><em>Nine Elms Cold Store. Photograph by Richard Gallon.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For 35 years between 1964 and 1999 almost every view of Vauxhall was dominated by one building – the Nine Elms Cold Store. And it wasn’t even the tallest.</p>



<p>Even when the much taller (88m) Market Towers<span id="easy-footnote-1-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-9140" title="Since demolished in preparation for the ‘landmark’ (what – another one?) One Nine Elms development featuring residential, office, hotel and retail space."><sup>1</sup></a></span> came along in 1975, it barely succeeded in distracting the eye from the cold store. This giant, concrete, windowless, and for years redundant, monolith was very much Vauxhall’s landmark and a symbol of SW8’s almost dystopian-looking late-industrial landscape.</p>



<p>For most of its life it stood empty, or if not quite empty then abandoned by its owners. It was often emphatically not empty. According to legend it was used as a cruising ground, a performance space, a recording studio, and a temple for devil worship. Some say people died in there, and that it featured in an episode of <em>The Sweeney</em>.<span id="easy-footnote-2-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-9140" title="‘In From the Cold’. Season 3 Episode 2."><sup>2</sup></a></span> Can these things possibly be true?’ Urban myths surely.</p>



<p>But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start almost at the beginning.</p>



<h2>1964–1979: The Chill Years</h2>



<p>The Nine Elms Cold Store stored cold things for less than half of its life. It held meat, fish, butter and cheese for 15 years then nothing for 20.</p>



<p>It opened on 30 November 1964<span id="easy-footnote-3-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-9140" title="‘£1M. Cold Store Opened’, <em>The Times.</em> Tuesday, 1 December 1964."><sup>3</sup></a></span> on land previously occupied by the <a href="https://vauxhallhistory.org/gas/">South Metropolitan Gas Works</a> which in turn had been built on the site of <a href="https://vauxhallhistory.org/candles/">Price’s Patent Candle Company</a>‘s Belmont works. The current occupant is the St George Tower and the green-glass, wing-topped St George Wharf apartments. Were these to be pitted against the derelict cold store in an ugliness competition it’s difficult to say who would win.</p>



<p>Anyway, the cold store was built, filling in Vauxhall Creek – the last vestige of the river Effra – in the process.<span id="easy-footnote-4-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-9140" title="Jon Newman (2016), <em>River Effra: South London’s Secret Spine</em>. Oxford: Signal Books."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>The opening merited a mention in <em>The Times</em> which reported that ‘Europe’s most modern cold store’ had cost its owners London Cold Storage Co (one of the Associated Fisheries Group of Companies) more than £1 million to build. With a capacity of two million cubic feet it could hold more than 16,000 tons of food<span id="easy-footnote-5-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-9140" title="<em>The Times</em>, ibid."><sup>5</sup></a></span> and goods could be loaded and unloaded there faster and more efficiently than at any other cold store in Europe.<span id="easy-footnote-6-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-9140" title="<em>Refrigeration and Air Conditioning</em>, Volume 68, Nos. 802–807."><sup>6</sup></a></span> Its purpose was to store produce for frozen-food processors and distributors.<span id="easy-footnote-7-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-9140" title="‘Quick Turn-round at New London Cold Store’, <em>Commercial Motor</em>, 11 Dec 1964."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>



<p>But why here? Why Nine Elms?</p>



<p>One reason was that the site was available. The gas works had disappeared in 1956 and the site was being used as a coach park. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://svsfilm.com/nineelms/bruns.htm" target="_blank">According to one account</a>, ‘Here a thieves’ market thrived, carefully observed and recorded by police officers watching from the top floor windows of <a href="https://vauxhallhistory.org/brunswick-house/">Brunswick House</a>.’</p>

<p>The location had excellent transport connections – river, road, and rail. Two barges could be unloaded simultaneously at the Cold Store’s 90ft Thames jetty<span id="easy-footnote-8-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-9140" title="<em>Refrigeration and Air Conditioning</em>, Vol. 68, Nos. 802–807."><sup>8</sup></a></span> and eight lorries at a time could use the four covered loading bays, according to a report in <em>Commercial Motor</em>.<span id="easy-footnote-9-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-9140" title="‘Quick Turn-round at New London Cold Store’, <em>Commercial Motor</em>, 11 Dec 1964."><sup>9</sup></a></span> ‘Hydraulic dock levellers are used at the lorry bays and electric pallet trucks and other mechanical aids are widely used,’ swooned the periodical in its report on the opening of the cold store.</p>



<p>In 1965 most of Nine Elms (including the site of the New Covent Garden Market and the since-shunted flower market) was occupied by railway yards. Today, the area’s railway history is all but forgotten but for 10 years from 1838 the area boasted its very own and quite grand railway terminus which was the end of the line for trains coming in from Woking and later Southampton. <a href="https://vauxhallhistory.org/nine-elms-station/">Nine Elms Station</a> stood at the end of Nine Elms Lane (then just called Nine Elms) which at that time emerged onto the Wandsworth Road roughly opposite the end of Miles Street (not Parry Street, as now). In 1848 the line was diverted before it reached the station to the new terminus at Waterloo via a new station at Vauxhall. The now-sidelined (literally) Nine Elms area became a massive railway yard and for over 120 years served variously as a carriage and wagon works, a goods depot and a locomotive depot.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/map-of-vauxhall.png" alt="" srcset="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/map-of-vauxhall.png 418w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/map-of-vauxhall-296x300.png 296w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/map-of-vauxhall-75x75.png 75w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px"></figure><p>When it was built in 1965 the Cold Store was served by lines which reached it by crossing Nine Elms Lane, as this map from around 1967 shows.</p></div>



<p>At this point, Nine Elms Lane still met the Wandsworth Road just north of Miles Street. It was presumably rerouted to its current position (opposite Parry Street) in the early 1970s when New Covent Garden flower market was built.</p>



<p>Sadly the Cold Store’s triple-transport-threat status was short-lived – the railway yard closed just two years later, in 1967.</p>



<h2>1979–1999: The Wilderness Years</h2>



<p>In 1979, 15 years after it opened, the Nine Elms Cold Store closed. Why?</p>



<p>Advances in refrigeration, the increase in air transportation, the demise of river-based haulage seem likely factors. And Associated Fisheries’ cold storage business had been badly affected by the UK’s 1973–75 recession.<span id="easy-footnote-10-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-9140" title="‘Associated Fisheries declines’, <em>The Times</em>, 9 July 1981."><sup>10</sup></a></span> But the value of the site must have played a significant role. In fact, the Chairman of Associated Fisheries suggested so much as far back as 1973 when the Cold Store had been open for less than a decade:</p>



<blockquote><p>Giving news to shareholders of Associated Fisheries […] Mr P. M. Tapscott, chairman refers to the proposed development of the Thames frontage on the south side of Vauxhall Bridge and the fact that AF’s Nine Elms cold store, a site of 1.6 acres, adjoins this development. Possibilities of re-development are, therefore, being closely examined.<span id="easy-footnote-11-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-9140" title="‘Chairmen&amp;#8217;s Reports’, <em>The Times</em>, 28 Nov 1973."><sup>11</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>



<p>London Cold Storage divested itself of the site pretty quickly after the Cold Store closed. In November 1980, <em>The Times</em> reported that contracts had been exchanged on the sale of the cold store and other property for £1.67 million cash with completion due on February 5.<span id="easy-footnote-12-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-9140" title="&amp;#8216;Associated Fisheries’, <em>The Times</em>, 21 Nov 1980."><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Which is when things begin to get really interesting at the Nine Elms Cold Store.</p>



<h2>Development Hell</h2>



<p>Why did it take 20 years for the Cold Store to be demolished? There’s probably a whole book to be written about it if there’s an audience for property development horror porn. Suffice to say that in the early days it involved Ronald Lyon, who could be described as a colourful property developer with an interesting business past.</p>



<p>Lyon got his hands on the Cold Store after the first proposal for the Effra site (which included land on both sides of the bridgefoot) fell apart.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/green-giant.png" alt="architect's image of never built green giant at nine elms" srcset="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/green-giant.png 443w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/green-giant-300x296.png 300w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/green-giant-75x75.png 75w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px"></figure><p><a href="http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=4248">The extraordinary 150m ‘Green Giant’ project</a> designed by architects Abbott Howard would have included 100 luxury apartments, 30,000 square metres of office space earmarked for Esso, and a gallery to hold the Tate’s sculpture collection.</p></div>



<p>Then along came Lyon, whose Arunbridge company was granted a controversial Special Development Order from the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine. This SDO would essentially allow Arunbridge’s office scheme to run roughshod over normal planning procedures. Despite this unfair advantage, Lyon failed to find the funding and the scheme collapsed. The Swiss Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co was holding the site as security against a loan and they sold it to Samuel Properties<span id="easy-footnote-13-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-9140" title="‘Samuel Properties plans 1,000 flats on Green Giant site’, <em>The Times</em>, 8 May 1985."><sup>13</sup></a></span> who in turn sold it to a Middle Eastern consortium, who then… well, you get the picture. One of the ongoing barriers to development seems to have been the Borough of Lambeth’s objection to swanky residential schemes of the kind it now welcomes with open arms.</p>



<p>Quite how it took two decades to knock the Cold Store down isn’t clear but one factor seems to have been the cost of demolition. One person involved in a government scheme to build a new Home Office on the Effra site recalls that the Cold Store was to be addressed late in the scheme due to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://svsfilm.com/nineelms/bruns13.jpg" target="_blank">the cost of demolishing it</a>.</p>



<p>After a long, lingering decline, the Nine Elms Cold Store was finally put out of its misery in (I think) 1999. Thankfully Jonathan Bell was around to record the event for posterity.</p>

<p>But until then, the Cold Store could hardly be described as empty…</p>



<h2>Screen Appearances</h2>



<p>London film makers in search of ‘bleak industrial landscape bordering on dystopian’ needed to look no further than Nine Elms – even before it was abandoned. Less hackneyed, less iconic, and more alien than Battersea Power Station, the Cold Store made fleeting background appearances in films such as <em>Villain</em> (1971), a crime film starring Richard Burton, and <em>The Optimists of Nine Elms</em> (1973) with Peter Sellers. But the most thrilling use of it must surely be the 1976 episode of cop series <em>The Sweeney</em> called ‘In From the Cold’, which featured this exchange on the very roof of the Cold Store.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Cruising to Casualty</h2>



<p>After the closure of the Cold Store in 1979 its most frequent visitors were gay men, who adopted it as a night-time cruising ground, handy for rounding off a night out at the nearby Royal Vauxhall Tavern or the Market Tavern which was housed in the Market Towers high-rise. The Cold Store was a bedroom and playroom to many liaisons over the years but was notorious for providing pleasure and danger in almost equal measure – sometimes with fatal consequences.</p>



<p>One visitor who narrowly escaped death but lived to tell the tale is John (not his real name):</p>



<p>“The Nine Elms Cold Store was where you went after a night at the Market Tavern if you didn’t get lucky. You crossed Nine Elms Lane via the footbridge (pedestrians were made to navigate all the Vauxhall Cross main roads that way back then) to a gate just to the left of the wall which still shelters Brunswick House from Nine Elms Lane today. The steel gate was 10 feet high, padlocked, and there was barbed wire across the top, but a gap had been forced open at one side through which you could squeeze to get in to the grounds of the cold store. There was no such thing as site security in those days.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>AM010</h2>

<p>It was late at night when I realized it was about to happen again.</p>
<p>The existing publishing tools I had at hand weren't particularly good to
showcase what I had in mind, but they were convenient enough that I could just
write and leave the problem of actually reading them to whoever happened to
land on that blog.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just a blog. Starting out with 8 patrons, the traffic it got was
mostly friends. They could bear with it.</p>
<p>But the unfortunate reality is that I can't quite stand watching something
being done poorly. It just broils in my gut the feeling that <em>we can do
better</em>. Editing could be simpler. Publishing could be faster. Thinking could
be easier.</p>
<p>I will try to best it, even if the end result ends up being worse, and while
I'll be the first to admit that perhaps it isn't the most attractive of
qualities, it always teaches me something new. Every now and then I do
manage to do it better. The world around me is a little better for it.</p>
<p>This time I had to sit down and write something. I didn't quite know what yet,
but I knew that how I had been writing was getting in the way of what I wanted
to write. So I took a step back and asked around how are the <em>cool kids</em> doing
it this days.</p>
<p>Many seem to like tools like <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>, or
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. They all provide some sort of structure or template you fit your
content into, a couple of ways to do theming and navigation, and the
possibility to run the whole shebang as a static or dynamically generated
service.</p>
<p>I just needed some static files, and I needed them in the structure they were
already in, so from the choices I was offered it looked like the winner was in
fact Next.js. It came with a few interesting features that I dismissed as
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?BellsWhistlesAndGongs">whistles &amp; bells</a>, and frowned at the requirement that
my pages would have to be translated into React components.</p>
<p>Surely a tool with such an emphasis on the "Developer Experience" would
consider the many formats my data could be in, and accommodate for it. But I
nonetheless decided to translate an essay into some Javascript code, and I
finally felt like I could start writing.</p>
<p>Until I had to embed some code.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was somehow recommended to go down the rabbit of hole of finding
good Javascript component libraries that would do the highlighting for me, that
worked with Next, from withing my own writing, which was now no longer just
text but in fact <em>a computer program posing as an essay</em>.</p>
<p>A quick look under the hood showed me there were over 100,000 lines of
Javascript code to turn my untranscendental words into a god damned website.</p>
<p><em>I sighed</em>.</p>
<p>There is a tolerable amount of complexity involved in doing our every day work.
I use <code>vim</code> and, on my computer, it runs on the Linux kernel. I tolerate the
many millions of lines of code from there down to the hardware it runs.
<strong>Tolerance</strong> here is the key word. They afford me things. Not physical things
like food, but the affordance that your thinking gains when you discover a new
idea.</p>
<p>When I first learned about <code>git</code> I suddenly had a new tool to think. I wasn't
familiar with branching models of Subversion or other versioning tools, but
<code>git</code>'s branches, merges, and code history extended my thinking. I have a vague
understanding of the internals of <code>git</code>, but I <strong>tolerate</strong> this complexity
because of what it affords me.</p>
<p>What was this tool really affording me with this complexity? I already had to
pay the cost of translating my content into the format it wanted of me, what
else is there? Hot reloading of assets. Great. My assets are stylesheet files,
the occasional image, and one or two embedded scripts. I can already refresh
a browser with a keypress. What else is there?</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this tools just doesn't support my use-case very well.
How can something so enormously popular and complicated as Next.js not support
my so seemingly simple use-case? I had to be wrong. Where is all this
complexity heading that I can't leverage it without bringing in even more of
it?</p>
<p>Some complexity exists because the underlying problem is in fact complex. It
needs to be dealt with and it cannot be reduced any further. We tend to call
this <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf"><em>Essential Complexity</em></a>. Did all the complexity
in Next exist only to justify <strong>making me feel productive</strong>?</p>
<p>I started wondering what really was so essentially complex about what I needed
to do, but it didn't take long to put a list of the things that seemed the most
independent from each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd like my Markdown files to be compiled into their corresponding HTML
files, respecting their existing structure</li>
<li>I'd like them to be optionally templated, to share some framing information</li>
<li>I'd like to only do work that needs to be done</li>
<li>I'd like my files to be served in a browser fast, and</li>
<li>I'd like my files to be updated automatically in the browser</li>
</ul>
<p>There were them. 5 requirements that this problem could be broken into.  It
shouldn't take more than a couple of days to explore each one of them in enough
depth to understand whether I was looking at massive Essential Complexity, or
not.</p>
<p>I decided to build this tool.</p>
<h4>1. Compiling Markdown to HTML</h4>
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown">Markdown</a> was introduced as a more humane way to write HTML. It has
evolved from a rather moving target of inconsistent syntaxes into a series of
standards, some describing a fairly complex format with plenty of features.</p>
<p>To build a Markdown to HTML compiler I'd have to be clear about <em>which</em>
Markdown format I'd be supporting. Since my content was currently written
mostly following <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm">Github Flavored Markdown</a>, that
seemed like the Markdown to target.</p>
<p>Every compiler has a series of stages that take the initial source code, or a
similar specification of a program, and turns into another language. Some
compilers turn this source code into machine language, some others just turn it
into another high-level language.</p>
<p>Whichever your target is, chances are the compiler will read some binary
strings (sometimes this is just UTF-8 text, sometimes its actual binary encoded
data), and transform them into something that it can operate on. Then it
proceeds to transform these data structures into something that more closely
resembles the desired output, maybe making some checks along the way.</p>
<p>In my case, I designed it to have 3 stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing of Markdown text — a parsing phase would require a Markdown
parser that would deal with the quirks of GFM, and the CommonMark spec it
builds on.</li>
<li>Transformation between Markdown structures and an HTML tree — this
would take data structures like <code>Paragraph { content: String }</code> or <code>List { elements: Vec&lt;ListElement&gt; }</code> and turn them into the appropriate HTML tree.</li>
<li>Writing out the HTML tree — which would take an <code>DomNode { tag: DomTag, attributes: Vec&lt;DomAttribute&gt;, children: Vec&lt;DomNode&gt; }</code> and turn it into a
String that can be written into a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can imagine some scaffolded code for this to look like:</p>
<pre><code>enum MarkdownNode {
  Heading1(Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt;), // corresponding to a #
  Heading2(Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt;), // corresponding to a ##
  Blockquote(Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt;), // corresponding to series of &gt;
  // ...
}

struct MarkdownDoc { nodes: Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt; }

enum HtmlTag { P, H1, /* ... */ }
struct HtmlAttribute { key: String, value: String }
enum HtmlNode {
  Tagged { 
    tag: HtmlTag,
    attributes: Option&lt;Vec&lt;HtmlAttribute&gt;&gt;,
    children: Option&lt;Vec&lt;HtmlNode&gt;&gt;
  },
  Literal {
    child: String
  }
}

fn string_to_markdown(input: String) -&gt; Result&lt;MarkdownNode, Error&gt; {}

fn markdown_to_html(md: MarkdownDoc) -&gt; Result&lt;HtmlNode, Error&gt; {}

fn html_to_string(html: HtmlNode) -&gt; String {}
</code></pre>
<p>It took me about an hour of reading the specification to realize that
implementing a parser for the entire syntax would easily take me over a week,
and I don't have that kind of time. It would likely be a very error prone
process as well.</p>
<p>A very fun thing to work on, for sure, but after understanding this specific
problem better, I can <em>tolerate</em> the complexity of bringing in a 3rd party
Markdown compiler into the table.</p>
<h4>2. Templating</h4>
<p>Templating can take many shapes and forms. From full blown programming language
support in the style of <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb">ERB (Embedded RuBy)</a>, to string
matching and replacing in more mundane forms.</p>
<p>Considering I do not need to perform any specific logic, my templating needs
are closer to a string-matching followed by some splitting and joining.</p>
<p>I have a <code>template.html</code> file that somewhere in the middle has a keyword that I
want replaced with the actual content of the essay I'm writing.</p>
<p>In pseudocode, this should be enough to achieve my goal:</p>
<pre><code>do_template(template, content) do
  [before, after] = template.split_at_word("$$document")
  return [before, content, after]
end
</code></pre>
<p>How exactly we are finding the word to be replaced by the content is less
important, but from the vast bibliography out there I keep a copy of <a href="https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/FPMbook">Flexible
Pattern Matching in Strings</a> that is a good resource to
implement some of these algorithms.</p>
<p>Once you know where to split the template to inject your content, the rest is
just string concatenation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, modern programming languages excel at providing us with string
manipulation tools, so putting it together took almost as much code as the
pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>// assume content and template are strings already
let compiled = template.replace("$$document", content);
</code></pre>
<p>For my use-case, the complexity of having an entire incrementally-rendering
component framework like React, to reuse components across pages that would
achieve the same effect, is simply <strong>not tolerable</strong>.</p>
<h4>3. Only doing work that needs to be done</h4>
<p>A lot of the tools we work with do the same thing over and over again.
Sometimes that is okay. Sometimes that is mandatory.</p>
<p>For my use-case, because I'd like to keep the output of the compilation
versioned, the compilation process should only redo the work that needs to be
done.</p>
<p>This has the side-benefit that recompiling these documents should be relatively
fast, since I tend to work on a single document at a time. Occasionally a
change in a template file would trigger only the recompilation of the documents
using it, …</p></section></section></div>

  <p>Last year, I <a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2019/11/woodville-renderman-challenge.html">participated in one of Pixar’s RenderMan Art Challenges</a> as a way to learn more about RenderMan <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3182162">(Christensen et al. 2018)</a> and as a way to get some exposure to tools outside of my normal day-to-day toolset (Disney’s Hyperion Renderer professionally, Takua Render as a hobby and learning exercise).
I had a lot of fun, and wound up doing better in the “Woodville” art challenge contest than I expected to!
Recently, I entered another one of <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/news/renderman-shipshape-art-challenge">Pixar’s RenderMan Art Challenges, “Shipshape”</a>.
This time around I entered just for fun; since I had so much fun last time, I figured why not give it another shot!
That being said though, I want to repeat the main point I made in my post about the previous “Woodville” art challenge: I believe that for rendering engineers, there is enormous value in learning to use tools and renderers that aren’t the ones we work on ourselves.
Our field is filled with brilliant people on every major rendering team, and I find both a lot of useful information/ideas and a lot of joy in seeing the work that friends and peers across the field have put into commercial renderers such as RenderMan, Arnold, Vray, Corona, and others.</p>

  <p>As usual for the RenderMan Art Challenges, Pixar <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/shipshape-pup-asset">supplied some base models</a> without any uvs, texturing, shading, lighting or anything else, and challenge participants had to start with the base models and come up with a single compelling image for a final entry.
I had a lot of fun spending evenings and weekends throughout the duration of the contest to create my final image, which is below.
I got to explore and learn a lot of new things that I haven’t tried before, which this post will go through.
To my enormous surprise, this time around my entry <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/news/renderman-shipshape-art-challenge-final-results">won first place in the contest</a>!</p>

  <p>For this competition, Pixar provided five models: a futuristic scifi ship based on an Ian McQue concept, a robot based on a Ruslan Safarov concept, an old wooden boat, a butterfly, and a sextant.
The fact that one of the models was based on an Ian McQue concept was enough to draw me in; I’ve been a big fan of Ian McQue’s work for many years now!
I like to start these challenges by just rendering the provided assets as-is from a number of different angles, to try to get a sense of what I like about the assets and how I will want to showcase them in my final piece.
I settled pretty quickly on wanting to focus on the scifi ship and the robot, and leave the other three models aside.
I did find an opportunity to bring in the sextant in my final piece as well, but wound up dropping the old wooden boat and the butterfly altogether.
Here are some simple renders showing what was provided out of the box for the scifi ship and the robot:</p>

  <p>I initially had a lot of trouble settling on a concept and idea for this project; I actually started blocking out an entirely different idea before pivoting to the idea that eventually became my final image.
My initial concept included the old wooden boat in addition the scifi ship and the robot; this initial concept was called “River Explorer”.
My initial instinct was to try to show the scifi ship from a top-down view, in order to get a better view of the deck-boards and the big VG engine and the crane arm.
I liked the idea of putting the camera at roughly forest canopy height, since forest canopy height is a bit of an unusual perspective for most photographs due to canopy height being this weird height that is too high off the ground for people to shoot from, but too low for helicopters or drones to be practical either.
My initial idea was about a robot-piloted flying patrol boat exploring an old forgotten river in a forest; the ship would be approaching the old sunken boat in the river water.
With this first concept, I got as far as initial compositional blocking and initial time-of-day lighting tests:</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_012.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/preview/progress_012.jpg" alt="Figure 4: Initial &quot;River Explorer&quot; concept, daylight lighting test."></a></p>

  <p>If you’ve followed my blog for a while now, those pine trees might look familiar.
They’re actually the same trees from <a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2018/10/bidirectional-mipmap.html">the forest scene I used a while back</a>, ported from Takua’s shading system to RenderMan’s PxrSurface shader.</p>

  <p>I wasn’t ever super happy with the “River Explorer” concept; I think the overall layout was okay, but it lacked a sense of dynamism and overall just felt very static to me, and the robot on the flying scifi ship felt kind of lost in the overall composition.
Several other contestants wound up also going for similar top-down-ish views, which made me worry about getting lost in a crowd of similar-looking images.
After a week of trying to get the “River Explorer” concept to work better, I started to play with some completely different ideas; I figured that this early in the process, a better idea was worth more than a week’s worth of sunk time.</p>

  <p><strong>Layout and Framing</strong></p>

  <p>I had started UV unwrapping the ship already, and whilst tumbling around the ship unwrapping all of the components one-by-one, I got to see a lot more of the ship and a lot more interesting angles, and I suddenly came up with a completely different idea for my entry.
The idea that popped into my head was to have a bunch of the little robots waiting to board one of the flying ships at a quay or something of the sort.
I wanted to convey a sense of scale between the robots and the flying scifi ship, so I tried putting the camera far away and zooming in using a really long lens.
Since long lenses have the effect of flattening perspective a bit, using a long lens helped make the ships feel huge compared to the robots.
At this point I was just doing very rough, quick, AO render “sketches”.
This is the AO sketch where my eventual final idea started:</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_015.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_015.jpg" alt="Figure 6: Rough AO render &quot;sketch&quot; that eventually evolved into my final idea."></a></p>

  <p>I’ve always loved the idea of the mundane fantastical; the flying scifi ship model is fairly fantastical, which led me to want to do something more everyday with them.
I thought it would be fun to texture the scifi ship model as if it was just part of a regular metro system that the robots use to get around their world.
My wife, Harmony, suggested a fun idea: set the entire scene in drizzly weather and give two of the robots umbrellas, but give the third robot a briefcase instead and have the robot use the briefcase as a makeshift umbrella, as if it had forgotten its umbrella at home.
The umbrella-less robot’s reaction to seeing the ship arriving provided the title for my entry- “Oh Good, The Bus Is Here”.
Harmony also pointed out that the back of the ship has a lot more interesting geometric detail compared to the front of the ship, and suggested placing the focus of the composition more on the robots than on the ships.
To incorporate all of these ideas, I played more with the layout and framing until I arrived at the following image, which is broadly the final layout I used:</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_019.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_019.jpg" alt="Figure 7: Rough AO render &quot;sketch&quot; of my final layout."></a></p>

  <p>I chose to put an additional ship in the background flying away from the dock for two main reasons.
First, I wanted to be able to showcase more of the ship, since the front ship is mostly obscured by the foreground dock.
Second, the background ship helps fill out and balance the right side of the frame more, which would otherwise have been kind of empty.</p>

  <p>In both this project and in the previous Art Challenge, my workflow for assembling the final scene relies heavily on Maya’s referencing capabilities.
Each separate asset is kept in its own .ma file, and all of the .ma files are referenced into the main scene file.
The only the things the main scene file contains are references to assets, along with scene-level lighting, overrides, and global-scale effects such as volumes and, in the case of this challenge, the rain streaks.
So, even though the flying scifi ship appears in my scene twice, it is actually just the same .ma file referenced into the main scene twice instead of two separate ships.</p>

  <p>The idea of a rainy scene largely drove the later lighting direction of my entry; from this point I basically knew that the final scene was going to have to be overcast and drizzly, with a heavy reliance on volumes to add depth separation into the scene and to bring out practical lights on the ships.
I had a lot of fun modeling out the dock and gangway, and may have gotten slightly carried away.
I modeled every single bolt and rivet that you would expect to be there in real life, and I also added lampposts to use later as practical light sources for illuminating the dock and the robots.
Once I had finished modeling the dock and had made a few more layout tweaks, I arrived at a point where I was happy to start with shading and initial light blocking.
Zoom in if you want to see all of the rivets and bolts and stuff on the dock:</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_032.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_032.jpg" alt="Figure 8: AO render of my layout going into shading and lighting. Check out all of the crazy detail on the dock that I modeled!"></a></p>

  <p><strong>UV Unwrapping</strong></p>

  <p>UV unwrapping the ship took a ton of time.
For the last challenge, I relied on a combination of manual UV unwrapping by hand in Maya and using <a href="https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/houdini-game-dev-tools-auto-uvs/">Houdini’s Auto UV SOP</a>, but I found that the Auto UV SOP didn’t work as well on this challenge due to the ship and robot having a lot of strange geometry with really complex topology.
On the treehouse in the last challenge, everything was more or less some version of a cylinder or a rectangular prism, with some morphs and warps and extra bits and bobs applied.
Almost every piece of the ship aside from the floorboards are very complex shapes that aren’t easy to find good seams for, so the Auto UV SOP wound up making a lot of choices for UV cuts that I didn’t like.
As a result, I basically manually UV unwrapped this entire challenge in Maya.</p>

  <p>A lot of the complex undercarriage type stuff around the back thrusters on the ship was really insane to unwrap.
The muffler manifold and mechanical parts of the crane arm were difficult too.
Fortunately though, the models came with subdivision creases, and a lot of the subd crease tags wound up proving to be useful hints towards good places to place UV edge cuts.
I also found …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<small>2020-08-03</small><!-- RSS:2020-08-03T07:25:00Z -->
<p>I've been very surprised and delighted over a number of years now by Microsoft's strong efforts in open
    source. I understand the skeptics, I was on Slashdot when they tried to sue Linux out of existence and I think only
    time will tell. I figure MS contributing is better than them hunting Linux distributions for sport. So I was mostly
    onboard for Microsofts efforts and I've especially found Visual Studio Code useful.</p>
<p>To settle a few things. When I tweeted on this subject I only got the response that I should use vim. Thanks. Great.
    I can and do on use vim. That misses a number of points. Visual Studio Code is an immensely popular editor and
    likely the most common recommendations to new developers. The primary reason I've used Visual Studio Code is
    that it has an incredibly compelling solution for remote pairing in the form of LiveShare. I've used that for a
    while with great success mentoring, coaching and generally working with other developers of varying experience and
    editor preferences. Most programmers can handle a "normal" editor like VS Code while something like Emacs
    or Vim depends a lot more on what they've learned.</p>
<p>I also ended up enjoying the Remote series of extensions for developing effectively inside remote servers or local
    containers.</p>
<h2>These things are proprietary</h2>
<p>At some point I read a piece of license that said that LiveShare could only be used with the Visual Studio family of
    products. "Huh, that sounds weird, VS Code is open source right?"</p>
<p>Sure enough. VS Code is fully MIT. The binary distribution has a separate license to allow telemetry and protect
    Microsoft trademarks and stuff. Nothing particularly weird, I can't really get worked up about telemetry, I know
    some can. But the extensions.. These extensions are in my book core differentiators that makes VS Code compelling.
    For me it is definitely part of what pushes it beyond the much leaner Sublime (paid, closed source) I was using
    before.</p>
<p>These extensions have a license limiting them and their online service parts to only be used with the Visual Studio
    family of products. This is the <a href="https://microsoftdocs.github.io/live-share/license/eula.html" title="License for LiveShare">license for LiveShare</a> and this is the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/preview-license" title="License for Remote">license for Remote</a>.</p>
<p>For me LiveShare is the most important thing. Google Docs style collaborative code editing, terminal sharing, port
    sharing and a bunch more features. I know Atom had an extension like this, I haven't checked the licensing there
    or tried it recently.</p>
<p>Remote is a very strong extension as well for anyone working on a server over SSH or in a container. It helps by
    installing extensions on the destination to allow language servers and such. I've seen it do terrible things to
    servers sometimes but it is very useful and generally works well.</p>
<p>It makes me uneasy to accept VS Code as an "open" project in any wider meaning of the word when compelling
    features are legally locked to only work inside the family of Visual Studio products. It makes me less certain that
    this isn't the Extend in Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. It also frustrates me that this prevents someone from
    building a compatible plugin for VIM or any other editor. This would be much more powerful if it could be in all the
    IntelliJs as well.</p>
<p>You'll find a repo for <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share" title="LiveShare on GitHub">LiveShare on GitHub</a> but it is only for documentation and issue tracking. There
    is no code. Same for <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release" title="Remote on GitHub">Remote</a>.</p>
<h2>The entire marketplace is proprietary</h2>
<p>Some additional salt in this particular wound is that the use of the Marketplace of VS Code extensions is also
    proprietarily licensed. So all these open source developers are shoving their extensions into a competitive
    advantage for one of the world's largest tech firms. And they disallow other uses of the marketplace. Even if
    the letter of open source is followed there is none of the openness, collaborative or community essence that I think
    exemplifies open source and free software projects.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? I guess it protects from the competition. Such as the <a href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium" title="VS Codium">VS Codium</a> project which provides VS Code
    binaries without the proprietary parts. But also, as a consequence of this, without the Marketplace of extensions.
    There is an open source alternative called <a href="https://open-vsx.org/" title="Open VSX">Open VSX</a>, but since
    it isn't the canonical one it is missing a bunch of extensions and the big Liveshare and Remote ones are still
    not allowed.</p>
<p>This also blocks the <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server" title="code-server">code-server editor</a> that
    allows running VS Code in the browser from using it which otherwise would have been perfect for me to do development
    on an iPad Pro. I can still use that but a lot of packages are not in Open VSX.</p>
<h2>What about lock-in?</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code is marketed with LiveShare and Remote as powerful extensions. VS Code is also marketed as open
    source. It is easy to use the editor, install the extensions and be under the impression that you are using an open
    source software suite where Microsoft simply hosts the peering service for identifying and connecting you and your
    collaborator.</p>
<p>But the peering service is not the only closed part. The extensions are not open source projects as far as I can find
    and they are licensed during distribution in a way that disallows using them with anything but Visual Studio
    products.</p>
<p>This leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I wasn't sold on having an Electron-based editor to begin with but
    VS Code was substantially leaner than Atom so I've been mostly accepting it.</p>
<p>If you have good suggestions for strong collaborative development tools that are open source, please let me know at
    <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>. If you want to follow my writing the RSS feed is

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p><img src="https://codingossip.github.io/assets/images/testing.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Testing software is one of the most complex tasks in software engineering. While in traditional software engineering there are principles that define in a non-ambiguous way how software should be tested, the same does not hold for machine learning, where testing strategies are not always defined. In this post, I elucidate a testing approach that is not only highly influenced by one of the most recognized testing strategies in software engineering - that is test-driven development. But also seems to be an approach that is agnostic from the family of machine learning models under testing, and adapts very well to the typical production environments that lead to the large scale AI/ML services of today.</p> <p>After reading this post, you will learn how to set up a testing strategy that works for machine learning models with production in mind. <em>Production in mind</em> means that the team you are operating in is heterogeneous, the project under testing is developed together with other data scientists, data engineers, business customers, developers, and testers. The goals of a good testing strategy are to achieve production readiness and improve code maintainability.</p> <p>An appropriate name of the approach is <em>Test-First</em> machine learning, in short TFML, because everything starts from writing tests, rather than models.</p> <h2 id="steps-of-tfml">Steps of TFML</h2> <p>A characteristic of TFML is to start from writing tests, instead of machine learning models. The approach is based on mocking whatever is not yet available so that different actors involved in the project can proceed with their tasks anyway. It is known that data scientists and data engineers run at a different pace. Mocking a particular aspect of the world that is not yet available not only mitigates such difference but also reduces blockers within larger teams. This, in turn, increases efficiency. Below are the five essential steps of a TFML approach.</p> <h3 id="1-write-a-test">1. Write a test</h3> <p>As the name suggests, Test-First in TFML indicates that everything starts with writing a test. Even for a feature that does not yet exist. Such a test is usually very short and should stay so. Larger and more complex tests should be broken down to their essential and testable components. A test can be written after understanding the feature’s specs and requirements that are usually discussed earlier during requirement analysis (e.g. use cases and user stories).</p> <h3 id="2-validate-a-test">2. Validate a test</h3> <p>A working test will fail or pass for the right reasons. This is the step in which such reasons are defined. Defining the happy path is essential to defining what should be observed and considered a success.</p> <h3 id="3-write-the-code">3. Write the code</h3> <p>In this step, the code that leads to the happy path is actually written. This code will cause the test to pass. No other code, beyond the test’s happy path, should be provided. For example, if a machine learning model is expected to return 42, one can just return 42 and force the test to succeed here. If time constraints are needed, adding <code>sleep(milliseconds)</code> is also acceptable. Such mocked values will provide engineers with visible constraints such that they can proceed with their tasks as if the model was complete and working.</p> <h3 id="4-run-tests">4. Run tests</h3> <p>Adding new tests should never break the previous ones. Having tests that depend on each other is considered an anti-pattern in software engineering.</p> <h3 id="5-add-functionality--cleanup--refactor">5. Add functionality (+ cleanup + refactor)</h3> <p>When values are mocked, success conditions are defined and tests are running, it’s time to show that the ML model under testing is training and performing predictions. Related to the example above, some questions that should find an answer in this step are:</p> <ul> <li>Is the test breaking the constraints we set previously?</li> <li>Is our ML model returning 84 rather than 42?</li> <li>How about time constraints?</li> </ul> <p>Traditionally, in this step developers perform code cleanup, deduplication, and refactoring (whenever it applies), to improve both readability and maintainability. This strategy should be applied to ML developers too.</p> <hr> <p>Falling in the trap of <em>alternative</em> approaches is easier in machine learning due to its nature and the enthusiasm of data scientists who <code>connect-train-analyze</code> data in no time.</p> <p>The most common approach in the data science community is probably the <em>Test-Last</em> approach a.k.a. <em>code now, test later</em>. This approach can be extremely risky in ML model development, since even for a trivial linear regression there might be just too many moving parts, compared with traditional software (e.g. UI, API calls, data streams, databases, preprocessing steps, etc.) As a matter of fact, the <strong>Test-First</strong> approach encourages and forces developers to put the minimum amount of code into modules depending on such moving parts (e.g. UIs and databases) and to implement the logic that should belong to the testable section of the codebase.</p> <p>One important pitfall to avoid is <em>developer bias</em>. Tests created in a Test-First environment are usually created by the same developer who is writing the code being tested. This can be a problem e.g. if a developer does not consider certain input parameters to be checked. In that case, neither the test nor the code will verify such parameters. There is a reason why in traditional software development, testing engineers and developers are usually not the same individuals.</p> <h2 id="tfml-anti-patterns">TFML anti-patterns</h2> <p>Below are some anti-patterns in TFML.</p> <h3 id="test-dependence">Test dependence</h3> <p>Tests should be standalone. Tests that depend on others can lead to cascading failures or success out of the developer’s control.</p> <h3 id="test-model-precisely">Test model precisely</h3> <p>As in traditional software engineering, testing precise execution behavior, timing or performance can lead to test failure. In machine learning, it is even more important to consider soft constraints because models can be probabilistic. Moreover, the ranges of output variables and input data can change. Such a dynamic and sometimes loosely defined behavior is the norm rather than the exception in ML.</p> <h3 id="test-models-mathematical-details">Test model’s mathematical details</h3> <p>Testing model implementation details such as statistical and mathematical soundness are not part of the TFML strategy. Such details should be tested separately and are specific to the family of the model under consideration.</p> <h3 id="large-testing-unit">Large testing unit</h3> <p>The testing surface should always be minimal for the functionality under test. Keeping the testing unit small gives more control to the developer. Larger testing units should be broken down into smaller tests, specialized in one particular aspect of the models to be tested.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>The TFML approach forces developers to spend initial time defining the testing strategy for their models. This in turn facilitates the integration of such models in the bigger picture of complex engineering systems where larger teams are involved. It has been observed that programmers who write more tests tend to be more productive. Testing code is as important as developing software core functionality. Testing code should be produced and maintained with the same rigor as production code. In ML all this becomes even more critical, due to the heterogeneity of the systems and the people involved in ML projects.</p>  </div> </article>  </div></div>]]>

But this is not right. As we know that FP is dedicated to forming a easy to understand and clear workflow without those obscure abstracted objects and relations.

The return value is consistent which made the program returnings foreseeable during or after the execution.</p><p>OOP made a solid structure which defined all the attributes a data model should contain. It makes it easy to modify or configure the data model.</p><p>In <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a>, the <code>reduers</code> and <code>middlewares</code> are usually defined only once. It means, we don't need the ability to update these properties and we don't hope them to be altered during the runtime. As for FP approach, it utilizes the <code>closure</code> technique that kills the possbility of exposing the internal properties. With some fantastic FP techniques (curry, compose, pipe), it's even making the program much more human-readable than OOP.</p><p>I would say FP should be the best fit for such scenario. Of course, the FP I'm talking about here is far from the real functional programming like Haskell.

<p><strong><u>A Money Mystery</u></strong></p>



<p>I have been unemployed for 10 months now and my net worth is greater today than it was when I quit my job. The purpose of this piece is to explain how that has happened.</p>



<p>First, I want to be clear about a few ways in which I did not make money. I did not receive any government money through unemployment nor from the stimulus checks. Unemployment money is not for people who quit their jobs voluntarily and the stimulus checks were not for people who made more than $99,000 in 2019. I have not had any paid job at any point in the last 10 months. I did not start a profitable business at any point during that time. I have not made any money from this blog. My only material source of income has been through the appreciation of investments that I have made on my own, but that is not the part the matters most.</p>



<p><strong><u>The Water Bucket Analogy</u></strong></p>



<p>What matters most is how I have kept from losing money.</p>



<p>To explain, let me introduce a simple analogy. Think about a bucket of water with a hose that fills it and a hole near the bottom where the water leaks out. The water in the bucket represents your money and the speed at which it leaks out of the hole is the speed at which your money is spent. Most people have a paying job. That’s the hose.</p>



<p>People want to increase their net worth over time and so naturally they think about how they can get more water faster from the hose. The better place to start, however, is to focus on limiting the leakage. People’s general focus on the hose rather than the hole is well demonstrated by the fact that anyone you ask will be able to tell you how much money they make by some unit of time but almost no one will be able to tell you the same in terms of their costs. They probably know the cost of their rent or mortgage payments and a number of other standalone expenses (by varying units of time) but very few will be able to tell you how much money they spend on an average day including their monthly, annual, and other periodic expenses spread out over the course of the respective period. I certainly could not have answered that question myself a year ago but doing so seemed like the sensible place to start.</p>



<p><strong><u>Base Burn Rate</u></strong></p>



<p>I knew when I quit my job in banking that in order to keep my cash burn in check I would need to get my expenses in order. I had turned the hose off so I needed to manage the hole. I started with my subscriptions (monthly and annual payments). I looked at the recurring expenses on my credit card and bank statements. I cancelled almost all of them. I had to add one significant one, health insurance, which my employer had been paying previously. I went with the second cheapest plan I could find from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield for $287/month. Next time I would instead go with the second cheapest plan from Oscar for $293/month because I like newer companies in broken industries and they tend to offer a better customer experience.</p>



<p>My next largest recurring payment was my phone bill. I went into the Verizon store and asked what the differences were between my current plan and the cheapest one I could possibly have. The only difference of any significance was the inability with the lower plan to use a hotspot. That infrequently used function was not nearly worth the ~$80/month difference in plans. I cut my phone bill in half to $78/month.</p>



<p>Below are the rest of my monthly and annual expenses as they stand today. As you will see, if I didn’t actively spend any money, these passive expenses alone would result in only a $15/day average burn. I call this my <strong><em>base burn rate</em></strong>. <em>Note: this figure was closer to $60 when I was living in New York pre-covid (+ rent, WiFi, utilities) and between $30-$60 when I was traveling in Europe and Asia (+ hostels/Airbnbs), but right now I am fortunate to be living with my family for free</em>.</p>

<p>Not bad right? It gets better…</p>



<p><strong><u>Passive Income</u></strong></p>



<p>I think about my investments in terms of three categories – crypto, stocks, and real estate. Real estate is unique among the three in that it pretty predictably generates cash flows each month. This is because our monthly rents collected from tenants are more than enough to cover the monthly mortgage payments, the cost of our property manager (10% of rent), and any necessary maintenance and/or repairs that she facilitates on our behalf over the course of a given month. Subtracting those expenses from the total rent collected each month and splitting the balance with my good friend and co-owner Kyle leaves me to expect $319/month (assuming the average amount of monthly repairs) which comes out to about $10/day. This is a far cry from the passive income of a real estate magnate but it is solid for a first property and not insignificant for me when it is the only dependable income that I have. Most importantly, this passive income offsets two-thirds of my base burn rate at the moment.</p>



<p>With my base burn rate and passive income figured out, I can calculate what I call my <strong><em>net base burn rate</em></strong> which in this case is equal to $5/day,</p>



<p><strong><u>3 Basic Principles</u></strong></p>



<p>After minimizing my base burn rate and estimating my passive income to calculate my net base burn rate, the next category I considered was comprised of the regularly re-occurring but variable expenses that cost me the most. This includes food, drinks, transportation, and entertainment. I came up with a few principles to help myself spend less in these areas. That said, I believe one of the best things money can buy is the ability not to have to worry about money so rather than force any hard rules upon myself I mostly just keep these principles in mind and try to be reasonable most of the time. <em>Note: these principles were most applicable when I was traveling and then living in New York pre-covid.</em></p>



<ol type="1"><li>Food – don’t drink a lot at restaurants. You are there for the food and the company.</li><li>Drinks – drink less and mostly at yours or friends’ places. The lower your tolerance, the cheaper the fun.</li><li>Transportation – walk when you can. Subways are usually quicker and always cheaper than cars.</li></ol>



<p><strong><u>Exceeding Expectations</u></strong></p>



<p>The goal is not to be watching your wallet all the time. It is to figure it out, then forget about it. Knowing my net base burn rate of $5/day leads to an annual burn of less than $2,000 allows me to live and spend confidently because I know if I ever want to slow my burn I can basically do so simply by doing nothing (therefore slowing my active spending). I don’t <em>need</em> to drink alcohol or go golfing and I could easily eat for a few dollars per day if I was willing to eat less healthfully and not go out for a while. Fortunately, I have not had to sacrifice any of these things. If I did have to, I know that I could, but I would probably just go and get a job at that point and realistically well before that point ever came.</p>



<p>In order to quit my job in the first place, I had to be willing to endure some level of burn in exchange for the freedom of time that I was buying for myself. I was confident that I could offset some of it with my investments in crypto and stocks, and the non- cash flow part of my real estate investment (the appreciation of the value of my equity in the property). Never would I have anticipated what has happened to date. I am pleased to say that between Bitcoin’s surge this week, Amazon’s last month, the appreciation of my Kentucky property’s value, and some other smaller stock and crypto investments along the way, my investments have now offset the entirety of my burn over the last 10 months. My net worth is slightly greater today than it was the day I quit my job, and it is not because I’ve been a hermit or lived a miserably frugal life. Quite the contrary. I traveled the world for a few months, had a four-month lease in New York City and stayed in a couple hotels before that, got a month-long Airbnb in Georgia with Lauren, have eaten well, been golfing a lot lately, and the list goes on. Not every day is roses. I would be skeptical of anyone who says that is the case. But I have not often if ever but rarely felt restrained moneywise. I have been enjoying my time quite a bit.</p>



<p>When I quit my job, I figured I would burn a good chunk of my savings in a few months and expected I would feel the need to get a job after several if not before then. I thought it would be well worthwhile to burn that money in exchange for the time that I would buy for myself to do whatever I wanted. I was right in the sense that this time has proven valuable to me but wrong in another. It hasn’t cost me a dime.</p>

    <p>As most reasonable people are familiar with the Harry Potter books,
their content serves as ideal material for building a mnemonic system.
The mnemonic major system, in particular, is used to memorize number sequences.</p>

<p>In order to implement the steps outlined in this post you need the content of the Harry Potter books (or other book(s) if you prefer).
In a previous post I showed you how to
<a href="https://darkshadow.io/2020/06/29/building-a-fantasy-book-db.html">download fantasy books and extract their text</a>.
Among the downloaded data were the Harry Potter books which I will use in this post.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-learn-the-sound-number-mapping">Step 1: Learn the sound-number mapping</h3>

<p>In the mnemonic major system each number from 0 to 9 is associated with one or more
consonant sounds. Use the following table as a reference.</p>

<table>
  <thead>

      <th>Number</th>
      <th>Sounds (IPA)</th>

<p>In English, letters are pronounced in different ways depending on the context,
that’s why some letters are repeated in different rows. But in the end,
only the sound matters, not the spelling.</p>

<p>I’m going to show you how to write a training program to internalize
the concept of mapping sounds to numbers in Step 4. But first, you need the ability
to convert text automatically to numbers. This happens in 2 steps. First, the text is converted
to IPA. Then, the IPA is converted to numbers.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-converting-ipa-to-numbers">Step 2: Converting IPA to numbers</h3>

<p>The process of converting IPA to numbers is very simple. I iterate through the IPA chars
and if there is a number associated with the char I append the number to the result.</p>

<p>For example, <code>major_decode_from_ipa('dɪfəkəlt')</code> yields <code>[1, 8, 7, 5, 1]</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I define a couple functions for converting number sequences to and from strings.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>numseq_to_str</span><span>(</span><span>numseq</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Convert number sequence to string."""</span>

<span>def</span> <span>str_to_numseq</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Convert string to number sequence."""</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>s</span> <span>if</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>isdigit</span><span>()]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For example, <code>numseq_to_str([1, 8, 7, 5, 1])</code> yields <code>'18751'</code>.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-converting-text-to-ipa">Step 3: Converting text to IPA</h3>

<p>In order to automatically convert text to IPA (and then to numbers) you need to use an IPA
dictionary.</p>

<p>Python’s <a href="https://pypi.org/project/eng-to-ipa/">eng-to-ipa</a> package is able to convert text to
IPA using the <em>Carnegie-Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary</em>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>eng_to_ipa</span>

<p>This yields:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html">['“i’ll* brɪŋ əp səm sandwiches.”*']</code></pre></figure>

<p>According to the docs, eng-to-ipa will reprint words that cannot be found in the CMU dictionary
with an asterisk. Thus, <code>“i’ll</code> and <code>sandwiches.”</code> have not been found. Clearly, the punctuation is the issue.
I preprocess the text in order to ease the conversion to IPA.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are 3 ways to pronounce this sentence depending on whether you like
to pronounce <code>sandwich</code> with <code>m</code>, <code>n</code> or <code>nd</code>. In order to use the major system effectively,
you should use the version that sounds most natural to you.</p>

<p>Let’s look at another example.</p>

<p>The word <code>gryffindor</code> was not found in the CMU dictionary, which can be expected.
After a quick search for the word’s pronunciation I found <a href="https://youglish.com/pronounce/gryffindor/english">YouGlish</a>

<p>I have shown that for many words there are several possible pronunciations, from which you need to choose
your preferred one, and that some words are not in the CMU dictionary and
require scraping the IPA from another source or are not available at all.
For these 2 reasons, you will need to build your own personal IPA dictionary.</p>

<p>I’m going to build my IPA dictionary by iterating through the words of the Harry Potter books
and adding each word and the corresponding IPA to my dictionary.</p>
