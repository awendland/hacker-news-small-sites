<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The primary purpose of software testing is to detect any potential defects in a program before it reaches its intended consumers. This is typically achieved by establishing functional requirements which define supported user interactions as well as expected outcomes, and then validating them using (automated) tests.</p>
<p>Consequentially, the value provided by such tests is directly dependent on how well the scenarios they simulate resemble the way the software is actually used. Any deviation therein diminishes that value, as it becomes harder to reason about the state of the would-be production system based on the result of a test run.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, our test scenarios, including the environment they execute in, should perfectly match real-life conditions. This is always desirable, but might not always be practical, as the system can rely on components that are difficult to test with, either because they are not available or because their behavior is inconsistent or slow.</p>
<p>A common practice in cases like this is to replace such dependencies with lightweight substitutes that act as <em>test doubles</em>. Although doing so does lead to lower confidence, it’s often an unavoidable trade-off when it comes to designing a robust and consistent test suite.</p>
<p>That said, while test doubles can be implemented in different ways, most of the time developers tend to resort to <em>mocking</em> as the default choice. This is unfortunate, as it leads to overuse of mocks where other forms of substitutes are typically more suitable, making tests <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object#Limitations">implementation-aware and fragile</a> as a result.</p>
<p>When writing tests, I prefer to avoid mocks as much as possible and rely on <em>fake</em> implementations instead. They require a bit of additional upfront investment, but provide many practical advantages which are important to consider.</p>
<p>In this article we will look at the differences between these two variants of test doubles, identify how using one over the other impacts test design, and why using fakes often results in more manageable test suites.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks of mocking</h2>
<p>As we enter the realm of software terminology, words slowly start to lose their meaning. Testing jargon is exceptionally notorious in this regard, as it always seems to create a lot of uncertainty among developers.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the concept of “mock” or how it’s fundamentally different from other types of substitutes is also one of those cases. Despite its highly ubiquitous usage, this term <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/346372/whats-the-difference-between-faking-mocking-and-stubbing">doesn’t have a single universally accepted interpretation</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html">original definitions introduced by Gerard Meszaros</a>, a mock is a very specific type of substitutes which is used to verify interactions between the system under test and its dependencies. Nowadays, however, the distinction has become a bit blurry, as this term is commonly used to refer to a broader class of objects created with frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/moq/moq4">Moq</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mockito/mockito">Mockito</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest">Jest</a>, and others.</p>
<p>Such substitutes may not necessarily be mocks under the original definition, but there’s very little benefit in acknowledging these technicalities. So to make matters simpler, we will stick to this more colloquial understanding of the term throughout the article.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a <strong>mock is a substitute, that pretends to function like its real counterpart, but returns predefined responses instead</strong>. From a structural standpoint, it does implement the same external interface as the actual component, however that <strong>implementation is entirely superficial</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>a mock is not intended to have valid functionality at all</strong>. Its purpose is rather to mimic the outcomes of various operations, so that the system under test exercises the behavior required by a given scenario.</p>
<p>Besides that, <strong>mocks can also be used to verify side-effects</strong> that take place within the system. This is achieved by recording method calls and checking if the number of times they appear and their parameters match the expectations.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how all of this works in practice. As an example, imagine that we’re building a system that relies on some binary file storage represented by the following interface:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IBlobStorage</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>Task<span>&lt;</span>Stream<span>&gt;</span></span> <span>ReadFileAsync</span><span>(</span><span><span>string</span></span> fileName<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>Task</span> <span>DownloadFileAsync</span><span>(</span><span><span>string</span></span> fileName<span>,</span> <span><span>string</span></span> outputFilePath<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>Task</span> <span>UploadFileAsync</span><span>(</span><span><span>string</span></span> fileName<span>,</span> <span>Stream</span> stream<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>Task</span> <span>UploadManyFilesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>IReadOnlyDictionary<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> Stream<span>&gt;</span></span> fileNameStreamMap<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As we can see, it provides basic operations to read and upload files, as well as a few more specialized methods. The actual implementation of the above abstraction does not concern us, but for the sake of complexity we can pretend that it relies on some expensive cloud vendor and doesn’t lend itself well for testing.</p>
<p>Built on top of it, we also have another component which is responsible for loading and saving text documents:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>DocumentManager</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>IBlobStorage</span> _storage<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>DocumentManager</span><span>(</span><span>IBlobStorage</span> storage<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>

        <span><span>$"docs/</span><span><span>{</span><span>documentName</span><span>}</span></span><span>"</span></span><span>;</span>

    <span>{</span>
        <span><span>var</span></span> fileName <span>=</span> <span>GetFileName</span><span>(</span>documentName<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This class gives us an abstraction over raw file access and exposes methods that work with text content directly. Its implementation is not particularly complex, but let’s imagine we want to test it anyway.</p>
<p>As we’ve identified earlier, using the real implementation of <code>IBlobStorage</code> in our tests would be troublesome, so we have to resort to test doubles. One of the simpler ways to approach this is, of course, by creating mock implementations:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>[</span><span><span>Fact</span></span><span>]</span>

    <span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above code snippet, the first test attempts to verify that the consumer can retrieve a document, given it already exists in the storage. To facilitate this precondition, we configure the mock in such way that it returns a hardcoded byte stream when <code>ReadFileAsync()</code> is called with the expected file name.</p>
<p>However, in doing so, we are inadvertently making a few very strong assumptions about how <code>DocumentManager</code> works under the hood. Namely, we assume that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling <code>GetDocumentAsync()</code> in turn calls <code>ReadFileAsync()</code></li>
<li>File name is formed by prepending <code>docs/</code> to the name of the document</li>
</ul>
<p>These specifics may be true now, but they can easily change in the future. For example, it’s not a stretch to imagine that we may decide to store files under a different path or replace the call to <code>ReadFileAsync()</code> with <code>DownloadFileAsync()</code>, as a means to preemptively cache files locally.</p>
<p>In both cases, the changes in the implementation won’t be observable from the user perspective as the surface-level behavior will remain the same. However, because the test we wrote relies on internal details of the system, it will start failing, indicating that there’s an error in our code, when in reality there isn’t.</p>
<p>The second scenario works a bit differently, but also suffers from the same issue. To verify that a document is correctly persisted in the storage when it gets saved, it checks that a call to <code>UploadFileAsync()</code> takes place in the process.</p>
<p>Again, it’s not hard to imagine a situation where the underlying implementation can change in way that breaks this test. For example, we may decide to optimize the behavior slightly by not uploading the documents straight away, but instead keeping them in memory and sending in batches using <code>UploadManyFilesAsync()</code>.</p>
<p>An experienced mocking practitioner might argue that some of these shortcomings can be mitigated if we configure our mocks to be less strict. In this instance, we can modify the test so it expects a call to any of the upload methods rather than a specific one, while also not checking the parameters at all:</p>

October 13, 2020 | https://thomasvilhena.com/2020/10/a-review-of-consensus-protocols | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thomasvilhena.com/2020/10/a-review-of-consensus-protocols">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The consensus problem is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems which requires a group of processes (or agents) to reliably and timely agree on a single data value. Although extensively discussed in the context of distributed computing it’s not exclusive to this field, also being present in our society in a variety of situations such as in democratic elections, the legislative process, jury trial proceedings, and so forth.</p>

<p>It’s solved through the employment of a consensus protocol governing how processes (agents) interact with one another. It may seem redundant but, to solve the consensus problem, first all processes agree to follow the same consensus protocol.</p>

<p>Some of these processes may fail or be unreliable in other ways (such as in a conflict of interest situation) so consensus protocols must be fault tolerant or resilient. The processes must somehow propose their candidate values, communicate with one another, and decide on a single consensus value.</p>

<p>In this post I review four major consensus protocols for solving the consensus problem based on my implementation of them, namely:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Chandra–Toueg</li>
  <li>Ben-Or</li>
  <li>Basic Paxos</li>
  <li>Nakamoto Consensus</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find supporting code for this analysis in this GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/TCGV/ConsensusKit">ConsensusKit</a></p>

<p>Before getting started let’s recap the three key properties of consensus protocols and take a quick look at relevant terminology for this discussion.</p>



<p>Formally a consensus protocol must satisfy the following three properties:</p>

<p><b>Termination</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Eventually, every correct process decides some value.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Integrity</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>If all the correct processes proposed the same value “v”, then any correct process must decide “v”.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Agreement</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Every correct process must agree on the same value.</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements are rather straight forward. “Termination” certifies the protocol is resilient to halting failures. “Agreement” deters any two correct processes from deciding on different values which would break consensus. Lastly “Integrity”, which is in fact flexible and may vary depending on application requirements, assures the protocol behaves in an expected and unbiased way.</p>



<p>These terms are used throughout this post as well within the provided support source code.</p>

<h4>Protocol</h4>

<p>The official set of rules (“algorithm”) governing the behavior of processes for solving the consensus problem.</p>

<h4>Process</h4>

<p>An individual agent belonging to a larger group of agents collectively interested in reaching consensus. Processes can be “correct”, meaning they strictly adhere to the protocol and are not subject to failures, or “faulty”, meaning we cannot rely on them following the protocol at all times.</p>

<h4>Instance</h4>

<p>A well-defined round of interactions among processes under a consensus protocol. Depending on the underlying protocol one or multiple intances are required for reaching consensus.</p>

<h4>Proposer</h4>

<p>A process role. Processes under this role are entitled for proposing values. Any value agreed upon by all correct processes must have originated in a proposer.</p>

<h4>Decider</h4>

<p>A process role. Processes under this role are entitled for deciding on a value. Any value agreed upon by all correct processes must have been voted by at least one decider.</p>

<h4>Archiver</h4>

<p>An application or a subsystem that is responsible for persisting decided values and implementing a protocol’s specific data constraints.</p>

<h4>Failure detector</h4>

<p>An application or a subsystem that is responsible for the detection of node failures or crashes.</p>

<h4>Majority</h4>

<p>A protocol’s specific threshold requiring at least half of available votes, more when faulty processes are taken into account.</p>

<h4>Quorum</h4>

<p>A protocol’s specific threshold which ensures that a minimum number of participants (or votes) is met for taking an action.</p>

<p>With these definitions in place let’s move on to the implementation and review of each consensus protocol.</p>



<p>My main goal has been to implement these four protocols in code to be able to run and evaluate them in a controlled environment. I was also interested in trying to spot structural similarities among them that could be extracted into a common base structure, promoting code reuse.</p>

<p>The result of my first coding iteration is displayed in the simplified class diagram below:</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://thomasvilhena.com/images/p22/main-classes.PNG" alt="Main Clasees">
</p>

<p>Three main classes are depicted in the diagram:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <b>Procotol</b> class has a collection of processes that will interact among each other according to the protocol rules for reaching consensus. Each execution of the protocol, through the <code>Execute</code> method, creates a new Instance (not to be confused with the conventional meaning of “instance” in object oriented programming).</li>
  <li>The <b>Instance</b> class represents one round of interactions among processes potentially resulting in a consensus, as indicated by the <code>Consensus</code> and <code>Value</code> properties. It’s responsible for managing the interaction between processes exercicing proposer and/or decider roles, providing methods for message delivery (<code>Send</code>) and retrieval (<code>WaitMessage</code> and <code>WaitQuorum</code>).</li>
  <li>The <b>Process</b> class is responsible for implementing proposer and/or decider roles. Behavior is defined in the <code>Bind</code> method just before the instance starts since, as well see, some protocols require processes to play different roles according the the current instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Process.Propose</code> virtual method is called at the start of an instance execution for all proposer processes in that instance to kick off communication and has the following default implementation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>protected</span> <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>Propose</span><span>(</span><span>Instance</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proposer</span><span>.</span><span>GetProposal</span><span>();</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>Archiver</span><span>.</span><span>CanCommit</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>))</span>
        <span>Broadcast</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Propose</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It first generates a proposal based on the underlying proposer logic (ex: random boolean proposer), then verifies against an archiver if the generated value passes custom application requirements and finally broadcasts it to all sibling processes.</p>

<p>Processes that bind to the <code>Instance.WaitQuorum</code> event will wait for the protocol specific amount of messages (for each message type) required for taking an action. The specific amounts are defined in each protocol implementation when deriving the Instance class.</p>

<p>All four consensus protocols were implemented using this base structure, as presented in the following sections. Rather than performing an extensive code analysis I will focus on presenting each theoretical algorithm and key points of my implementation.</p>



<p>The Chandra–Toueg consensus algorithm was first published by Tushar Deepak Chandra and Sam Toueg in 1996 and introduced the concept of failure detectors as means for solving the consensus problem. The algorithm assumes a number of faulty processes denoted by <b>f</b> that’s less than <b>n/2</b> (i.e. less than simple majority).</p>

<p>In each instance one process acts as the decider (rotating coordinator) and all other processes act as proposers. The actions carried out in each instance are<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All processes send (r, preference, timestamp) to the coordinator.</li>
  <li>The coordinator waits to receive messages from at least half of the processes (including itself).
    <ol>
      <li>It then chooses as its preference a value with the most recent timestamp among those sent.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The coordinator sends (r, preference) to all processes.</li>
  <li>Each process waits (1) to receive (r, preference) from the coordinator, or (2) for its failure detector to identify the coordinator as crashed.
    <ol>
      <li>In the first case, it sets its own preference to the coordinator’s preference and responds with ack(r).</li>
      <li>In the second case, it sends nack(r) to the coordinator.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The coordinator waits to receive ack(r) or nack(r) from a majority of processes.
    <ol>
      <li>If it receives ack(r) from a majority, it sends decide(preference) to all processes.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Any process that receives decide(preference) for the first time relays decide(preference) to all processes, then decides preference and terminates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look at the code. The following code snippet defines the proposer process behavior:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>BindAsProposer</span><span>(</span><span>Instance</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>WaitQuorum</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Select</span><span>,</span> <span>msgs</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>msgs</span><span>.</span><span>Single</span><span>();</span>
        <span>SendTo</span><span>(</span><span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Source</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Ack</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>WaitQuorum</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Decide</span><span>,</span> <span>msgs</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>msgs</span><span>.</span><span>Single</span><span>().</span><span>Value</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Terminate</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On instance start proposers broadcast their values. Then they wait for a quorum to select a value from the pool of proposals. Since the protocol defines only a single decider per round this quorum is met when the decider process broadcasts his selection. Upon receiving this selection the proposer node will acknowledge it and wait for the decider’s decision, and then decide on the same value and terminate execution.</p>

<p>Now let’s see the code defining the complementary decider processes behavior:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>BindAsCoordinator</span><span>(</span><span>Instance</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>WaitQuorum</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Propose</span><span>,</span> <span>msgs</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>PickMostRecentValue</span><span>(</span>
            <span>msgs</span><span>.</span><span>Where</span><span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Archiver</span><span>.</span><span>CanCommit</span><span>(</span><span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>))</span>
        <span>);</span>

        <span>Broadcast</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Select</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>WaitQuorum</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Ack</span><span>,</span> <span>msgs</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>PickMostRecentValue</span><span>(</span><span>msgs</span><span>);</span>
        <span>Broadcast</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Decide</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
        <span>Terminate</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It first waits for a quorum of proposals, i.e, for a simple majority of proposers to submit their values. Then the decider picks the most recent message value, possibly validating the value with the archiver, and broadcasts the selected value back to all processes.</p>

<p>After broadcasting the selected value the decider waits for a quorum of proposers to acknowledge it, in which case it decides on that value and broadcasts its decision to all processes before terminating.</p>

<p>Notice that this simplified implementation doesn’t take failures into account, even though the Chandra–Toueg protocol is fault-resilient.</p>



<p>Ben-Or is a decentralized consensus protocol, i.e., it doesn’t assign the decider role to any specific process. Curiously the algorithm correctness proof was only provided in a paper 15 years after its original publication<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Because it lacks a decider for solving tie-break …</p></div></div>

This article focuses specifically on how the new LiDAR Scanner will change the way you use and create Augmented Reality experiences.</p></blockquote></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="b5e8">For a major launch such as this, Apple normally holds a press conference in their Cupertino headquarters. However, due to growing health concerns and widespread retail shutdowns, the company opted instead for an online-only launch for their latest device. Sporting a powerful 8-core processor and LiDAR scanner, the iPad Pro looks more like a computer replacement than ever before.</p><p id="f7c2">This launch, undoubtedly, increased the “pro” factor of the iPad Pro. The redesigned model of the iPad Pro was originally launched in 2018, which was a significant improvement over previous generations, as it featured smaller bezels, a new form factor, Face ID, and an advanced processor. This year, Apple kept the same form factor but made significant under-the-hood improvements.</p><h2 id="85d2">Cameras and Sensors</h2><p id="21ef">The most visible change to the second-generation iPad Pro is the addition of a camera and LiDAR sensor. The “camera bump” on the device more closely resembles the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro lineup. The first camera is a standard 12MP Wide camera, and the second camera is a 10MP Ultra Wide camera. You’ll learn more about the LiDAR sensor a bit later.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3640/1*g-5cEVntl9j7lK-clpB9MQ.jpeg" width="1820" height="1213" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*g-5cEVntl9j7lK-clpB9MQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*g-5cEVntl9j7lK-clpB9MQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*g-5cEVntl9j7lK-clpB9MQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*g-5cEVntl9j7lK-clpB9MQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*g-5cEVntl9j7lK-clpB9MQ.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The camera and time-of-flight sensors on the new iPad Pro.</figcaption></figure><p id="9792">This arrangement allows you to take better-quality photos and videos with your iPad Pro—but do you really want to be the person who uses a 12.9" tablet to videotape a concert? A more plausible use for the upgraded cameras would be for stationary recordings, such as interviews.</p><h2 id="1f17">Microphones</h2><p id="1d60">Going hand-in-hand with the upgraded cameras on the new iPad Pro, it also has an upgraded array of microphones. An increase from three mics on the previous generation of the device, the new version has five microphones and promises “pro-audio” with “studio-quality mics.”</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3920/1*JHM8yPbMjUePsqdUKlmy6w.jpeg" width="1960" height="1102" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*JHM8yPbMjUePsqdUKlmy6w.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*JHM8yPbMjUePsqdUKlmy6w.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*JHM8yPbMjUePsqdUKlmy6w.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*JHM8yPbMjUePsqdUKlmy6w.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*JHM8yPbMjUePsqdUKlmy6w.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>A man records an interview using the new iPad Pro and without external microphones.</figcaption></figure><p id="a1a0">The new audio-video upgrades of the device shows that Apple is targeting the film industry with their new product, for on-the-go shoots or quick editing. However, it’s unclear how much better the quality is from the previous generation . We’ll learn more when people begin using it and sharing content.</p><h2 id="f740">Processor and Wi-Fi</h2><p id="755f">The latest version of Apple’s iPad Pro also gets upgrades on the inside. Apple’s custom A12Z Bionic Chip sports an eight-core GPU and CPU, which will significantly increase the performance of the device in gaming and video editing. In addition, it features enhanced LTE support up to one gigabit, and a new Wi-Fi 6 module, which isn’t even present on their Mac lineup yet.</p><h2 id="a5b9">Cursor and Magic Keyboard</h2><p id="2bb8">One of the upgrades which makes the iPad Pro more like a computer is the added support for a cursor and the trackpad on Apple’s new Magic Keyboard. This allows for a more computer-like interaction with the device, while maintaining a fluid, touch-based interface. In other words, they’ve made sure that their cursor support doesn’t take away from their touch-first device.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*zwO_y1lb4GlBjxClyKj0tA.jpeg" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*zwO_y1lb4GlBjxClyKj0tA.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*zwO_y1lb4GlBjxClyKj0tA.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*zwO_y1lb4GlBjxClyKj0tA.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*zwO_y1lb4GlBjxClyKj0tA.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*zwO_y1lb4GlBjxClyKj0tA.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The iPad Pro attached magnetically to the Magic Keyboard.</figcaption></figure><p id="e851">The new keyboard has a “floating design,” which means that it suspends the device in the air for more flexibility in terms of viewing angles. In addition, it provides an additional USB-C port, in case you need more than one. Of course, it has a new trackpad to control the cursor and a backlit keyboard for nighttime use.</p><p id="f4d8">So now you’ve gotten a quick look at how the iPad Pro has changed—but what’s with all the buzz about augmented reality (AR)? Well, it turns out that the LiDAR sensor on the new device makes AR a whole lot more accurate and stable. This sensor allows the iPad to obtain a precise map of the surroundings, similar to how Face ID measures the contours of your face.</p></div></div></section><section></section><section><div><div><h2 id="2442">What is LiDAR?</h2><p id="626f">You may be wondering what this “magical” new sensor is and how it works. The acronym LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging. A LiDAR scanner fires hundreds of thousands of laser beams and measures the time it takes for that light to return. Using this data, it’s able to measure how far away each point is, resulting in an accurate 3D map of the surroundings. Because of this, LiDAR scanners are often referred to as time-of-flight sensors.</p><p id="087d">The technology is currently used for a variety of different tasks. For years, space satellites have used LiDAR to map the surface of the Earth. More recently, LiDAR has made its way into driverless vehicles to precisely map cars, traffic lights, and roads. Now, the technology is being used on the new iPad Pro—and likely on future smartphones and tablets—to improve its ability to create immersive augmented reality experiences.</p><h2 id="3fcc">LiDAR and AR</h2><p id="bbd5">Previously, devices could only assess the surrounding area using their built-in cameras, but with the addition of a LiDAR Scanner, the iPad Pro can use a precise 3D map to place virtual objects, instead of a rough, camera-based model of the surroundings. This, in turn, allows objects to actually stay where they were placed, as opposed to moving around.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3920/1*Io4b6fwPxsEg5Wai5wH7rQ.png" width="1960" height="1102" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Io4b6fwPxsEg5Wai5wH7rQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Io4b6fwPxsEg5Wai5wH7rQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Io4b6fwPxsEg5Wai5wH7rQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Io4b6fwPxsEg5Wai5wH7rQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Io4b6fwPxsEg5Wai5wH7rQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>An iPad Pro user playing an AR-based game in their living room.</figcaption></figure><p id="b96e">Developers who’ve used ARKit to develop AR-enabled apps for the iPad will automatically get the benefits of the newly improved hardware, and if you’re thinking of building an AR-based app, now is a great time to jump in. In the image shown above, all of the objects you see are virtual, and the user is playing on an empty rug. This illustrates the improvements made to the augmented reality technology on the new iPad Pro.</p><h2 id="26a9">Future Devices</h2><p id="577a">There’s no doubt that the iPad’s use of LiDAR technology will revolutionize the landscape of augmented reality on mobile devices. Over the next few months, we can expect other device manufacturers to follow suit and release their own products with such technology. In terms of Apple, we can expect them to introduce such technology in future version of their iPhones and possibly on other devices as well.</p><p id="881a">It’s clear that Apple’s launch brought the iPad Pro closer to a “pro” device and a laptop replacement, while keeping it’s reputation as a user-friendly tool for the masses. The new sensors, cameras, and processors provide developers a great new platform to engage their users and provide them a multi-purpose device great for both work and play.</p><p id="821a">As we learn more about this new device, we’ll know more about the great ways that LiDAR improves augmented reality experiences, and we can trust that our great developer community will create new, innovative apps that take advantage of this technology.</p><p id="1990">Be sure to <strong>smash that “clap” button</strong> as many times as you can, <strong>share this tutorial</strong> on social media, and <strong>follow me on Twitter.</strong></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="64a0"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

October 13, 2020 | https://www.twingate.com/blog/secure-elastic-with-twingate/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.twingate.com/blog/secure-elastic-with-twingate/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p><h4><strong>The Challenge with Securing Elastic</strong></h4></p><p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elasticsearch</a> is a popular search and analytics engine that organizations use for all types of data. Elasticsearch, along with other tools in the “Elastic Stack,” such as Kibana and Logstash, are available for free and under a variety of paid subscription plans.&nbsp; However, only the most expensive plans offer the ability to restrict access to users that can authenticate with your company’s identity provider.</p><p>This means that if you want to integrate Elastic with an identity provider to enable single sign-on, you will need to pay a steep additional price tag. This is problematic for organizations because Elastic is often used to store and process large volumes of sensitive data. Even though security is, paramount, the additional cost to adequately secure this data may be prohibitive for some organizations.</p><p>As a result, many Elastic users rely on “security by obscurity”, which isn’t “security” at all and creates an unacceptable risk for businesses. Last August, an online database operated by a data broker containing personal data of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/20/database-breach-exposes-profile-data-for-235m-tiktok-instagram-and-youtube-accounts/">over 230 million users</a> was exposed. While the database’s existence was not publicized, a <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/social-data-leak/">security researcher</a> discovered it was nonetheless publicly accessible and not password protected. Far from being an isolated incident, unsecured Elasticsearch servers have also resulted in data breaches leaking <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/french-hotel-giant-leaks-1tb-of/">1 terabyte of customer data last November</a> and <a href="https://securitydiscovery.com/data-breach-database-data-breach/">5 billion records containing personal data in March</a>.</p><p>In response, developers have hacked together <a href="https://logz.io/blog/securing-elk-nginx/">workaround solutions</a> to put authentication proxies in front of Elasticsearch, but those workarounds are brittle, difficult to setup and maintain, and offer questionable security given the use of shared passwords. Even when the security functionality of Elasticsearch is available, it can be tricky to set up correctly, as one major company discovered when a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2020/09/23/microsoft_leaks_over_65tb_bing">misconfiguration exposed <em>6.5 </em></a><em><a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2020/09/23/microsoft_leaks_over_65tb_bing">terabytes</a></em><a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2020/09/23/microsoft_leaks_over_65tb_bing"> of search data</a> to the public!</p><p>It’s clear that securing Elasticsearch adequately is crucial to preventing server breaches. However, what can you do if you don’t have access to Elastic’s SSO functionality or if you find it’s complicated to configure correctly?</p><p><h4><strong>How to Secure Elasticsearch with SSO &amp; MFA using Twingate: Step-by-Step</strong></h4></p><p>Twingate is a quick and simple way to add authentication and authorization controls to Elastic (or any other service you want to protect). With Twingate, your identity provider’s SSO functionality can be leveraged without needing to change anything about your Elastic instance. You can also configure user groups which are authorized to access Elastic, and define access policies that, for example, enforce MFA checks on users requesting access to it.&nbsp; By securing your Elasticsearch server with SSO and MFA, you'll reduce the prospect of a data breach. Check out <a href="https://docs.twingate.com/docs/twingate-vs-vpn">this page</a> for more details on the benefits of using Twingate for secure remote access.</p><p>To get started, first sign up for free account at <a href="https://www.twingate.com/">www.twingate.com</a>.&nbsp; Once you complete the sign up, just follow these steps:</p><p><strong>1. Add a Remote Network. </strong>Add a Remote Network for the network that your Elastic server is on.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">Enter a network name</figcaption></figure><p><strong>2. Deploy a Connector into that Remote Network.</strong> Click on the newly created Remote Network, then add a <a href="https://docs.twingate.com/docs/understanding-access-nodes">Connector</a> to that network. You will be asked to authenticate yourself for security purposes. Next, click on Provision and get a command that you can use to deploy a Connector in that network. The Connector doesn’t need to be deployed to the same server on which Elastic is housed - it just needs to be deployed on a device on the same network.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">Click to set up a new connector in a network</figcaption></figure><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">Add a connector</figcaption></figure><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">Click Provision to deploy your connector</figcaption></figure><p><strong>3. Verify Connector Deployment.</strong> Once your Connector has been deployed, the icon for that Remote Network will have a green dot, meaning it’s hooked up to Twingate.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">A green dot indicates successful connector deployment</figcaption></figure><p><strong>4. Add Elastic as a Resource.</strong> The next step is to add a Resource that represents the Elastic server (or servers). You can identify servers by individual IP addresses, a locally resolvable domain name, with CIDR notation or by using wildcards.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">Click to add a new resource</figcaption></figure><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">Enter new resource details</figcaption></figure><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">A green dot indicates an active resource</figcaption></figure><p><strong>5. Create an Identity Provider MFA Access Policy.</strong> Now that we have our Elastic server added to Twingate, we now need to define who has access to that server and under what authentication conditions (e.g. forcing MFA checks for every access, or only once per week). These conditions are referred to as Access Policies. Access Policies are first set up in your identity provider and then tied back to Twingate. For example, see here for instructions on <a href="https://docs.twingate.com/docs/okta-access-policies">how to create Access Policies in Okta</a>.</p><p><strong>6. Add that Access Policy into Twingate.</strong>&nbsp; Once you have set up an appropriate Access Policy in your identity provider, you can add an Access Policy into Twingate in the Settings → Identity Provider → Access Policies section.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">Enter access policy details</figcaption></figure><p><strong>7. Create a Group and Assign Permissions. </strong>Next, go to the Group tab and add a new Group. On this screen you can give your Group a name and associate it with the Access Policy you just created. You can also add user to the Group, and assign which Resources the Group should have access to. In this case, you would add the Elastic server resource created in step 4.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption font-size="2">Assign users and resources to a group</figcaption></figure><p>And you’re done! In our example, any user who is part of the Data Analytics group can <a href="https://get.twingate.com/">install the Twingate client</a>, sign in, and then be able to access the Elastic server at 10.0.0.29. When the user attempts to access that IP address, they will be prompted to authenticate using the Access Policy we assigned the Data Analytics group - in our case, MFA. Notice that we didn’t have to touch Elastic at all to secure access to it!</p><p><h4><strong>Try It Out</strong></h4></p><p>If you want to try it out for yourself, <a href="https://www.twingate.com/pricing">sign up for a free trial of Twingate today</a>!</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From 0 to 90k impressions in about a year, following <strong>S</strong>earch <strong>E</strong>ngine <strong>O</strong>ptimization good practices was key to help to grow my blog and my audience. However, when I started it, <strong>I made terrible mistakes</strong> that some SEO literate people could almost qualify as self-sabotage.</p><p>Thus, I want to dedicate this blog post <strong>to look back at 3 issues</strong> that caused me, and many others, countless headaches when dealing with SEO and Gatsby and <strong>the steps I took to fix them</strong>. I hope that this will help to fix some issues you might currently have on your awesome blog or portfolio without even being aware of them, kick-off your audience growth, and get discovered online 🚀.</p><section id="why-seo-is-so-important-section"><h2 id="why-seo-is-so-important"><a href="#why-seo-is-so-important" aria-label="why seo is so important permalink"><svg style="width:0px;height:0px"></svg></a>Why SEO is so important?</h2><p>You might know very little about what SEO does behind the scenes. To me, at least, it looked like an obscure, inconsistent, pseudo-science that only marketing people could understand (spoiler alert, it still kind of is).
However, after getting <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent">@monicalent</a>'s awesome course <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/">bloggingfordevs</a>, it made the inner workings and good practices related to SEO a bit clearer to me. To quote her from her first newsletter</p><blockquote><p>SEO is a way of making sure that search engines can understand what your page is about, that it contains quality up-to-date information from an authoritative source, and will answer the question that the searcher had in mind.</p></blockquote><p>With good SEO, search engines can know what your content is about, discover all the blog posts you've written and, if you're lucky, catapult you to the top search result for a given set of keywords. Moreover, where <strong>sharing my newest articles on Twitter and Reddit would just cause a spike in traffic for a few days</strong>, <strong>SEO helps you get a more consistent traffic</strong> on your website, and for a longer time. The latter is what I was lacking for the longest time, despite having set up my Gatsby website and SEO component properly (or at least I thought so).</p><p>Gatsby's documentation has an incredibly well-written section on <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/seo-and-social-sharing-cards-tutorial/">how to build an SEO component</a> to help you get started. However, that alone wasn't enough to make my blog discoverable early on, as you can see in the chart below representing the number of daily impressions I got since starting this blog:</p><figcaption>Chart representing the number of impressions per day of this blog on Google Search from August 2019 to the October 2020 (hover to see the data)</figcaption><p>For most of its first year, my blog was getting less than 50 daily impressions. <strong>Today</strong>, after fixing the issues I'm about to talk about, <strong>I get over 1000 daily impressions and it's still growing!</strong>
Of course, SEO is not the only component here, I also created more content this year and choose a better way to promote them, but it is still a significant driver to the growth you can see above.</p></section><section id="trailing-slashes-chaos-section"><h2 id="trailing-slashes-chaos"><a href="#trailing-slashes-chaos" aria-label="trailing slashes chaos permalink"><svg style="width:0px;height:0px"></svg></a>Trailing slashes chaos</h2><p>The blog you're reading this article on is built with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify. Sadly, using these two tools together without taking care of inconsistent trailing slash <code>/</code> at the end of your URLs can result in some undesirable outcomes.</p><p>One of these outcomes was that I was seeing a lot of <code>301</code> redirects logged in my analytics as readers were navigating to my articles. On my blog, a link to one of my blog posts would typically look like this: <code>/posts/learning-in-public</code> but when a reader clicked on it Netlify would append a trailing slash at the end of it thus redirecting the user.</p><p>That, my friends, is extremely bad for SEO. It impacted several unrelated areas of my website, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Opengraph images or Twitter cards not being rendered consistently</strong>: readers would share a link sometimes with or without the trailing slash which would make it hard for some services to get the proper metadata and thus render a simple link instead of a proper preview card.</li><li><strong>Invalid URLs in sitemap</strong>: my sitemap is generated automatically at build time with a Gatsby plugin based on the URLs and pages of my website. Since I did not have trailing slashes at the end of my URLs it would generate my sitemap without them which once uploaded to Google Search Console would result in tons of warnings about invalid URLs since Google referenced the ones with the trailing slashes.</li></ul><section><h3 id="how-i-fixed-this"><a href="#how-i-fixed-this" aria-label="how i fixed this permalink"><svg style="width:0px;height:0px"></svg></a>How I fixed this</h3><p>I could have fixed this in two different ways:</p><ol><li>Disable the "Pretty URLs" option in Netlify's asset optimization settings. (see screenshot below)</li><li>Add a trailing slash to all my URLs on my blog.</li></ol><figure>

  </figure><p>As Google already referenced my blog posts with a trailing slash, I decided to go with option number 2.</p><p>That change might look insignificant, but it resulted in a lot of weird issues suddenly disappearing. Additionally, it was essential for me to fix this before addressing the issue I'm just about to start talking about 😄!</p></section></section><section id="canonical-links-section"><h2 id="canonical-links"><a href="#canonical-links" aria-label="canonical links permalink"><svg style="width:0px;height:0px"></svg></a>Canonical links</h2><p>If you've been following me for a while, you might have started reading my content on <a href="https://medium.com/@MaximeHeckel">Medium</a>. I started blog.maximeheckel.com just about a year ago as of the time I'm writing these words. All the content on this site that dates back to before August 2019, was originally published on Medium.</p><p>On top of that, I did not edit the articles when migrating them to this website, nor did I delete the Medium ones. This resulted in <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/duplicate-content">duplicated content</a>, which meant that my newly deployed blog was in competition with Medium on the same keyword, the same content, from the same author when it comes to ranking on Google.</p><p>Thankfully there's a way to avoid this: <strong>setting canonical URLs</strong>. These URLs are placed in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your blog posts source code and designate that this post is the "original" post with that given content.</p><p>There are 2 steps to add valid canonical URLs to your website:</p><ol><li>You need to add them to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your post. For example: <code>&lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/learning-in-public/" /&gt;</code></li><li>Head over to any third party platform you used in the past that has the content and add this canonical URL into the setting page of your post. I followed <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033930293-Set-a-canonical-link">this guide</a> on Medium to update my old blog post.</li></ol><p>Of course, you cannot do the first step until you've fixed any potential trailing slashes issues you may have like the ones I shared just above.</p><div><p>If like me you're a Gatsby user, you might be tempted to use <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-canonical-urls/">gatsby-plugin-canonical-urls</a> which adds canonical URLs to your site's HTML pages at build time. </p><p><strong>I do not recommend this plugin</strong> for complex setups.</p><p>I tried it and it would consistently fail to put the proper URL, especially since my website as offline support it would sometimes write the offline fallback url in the <code>&lt;head/&gt;</code> of my HTML pages.
You'll be safer to add your canonical links programmatically in your own SEO component. See the code snippet below for an example. </p></div><div><div><p data-testid="codesnippet-title">Simplied version of the SEO component I built with support for canonical URLs</p></div><pre

                            <p>RICHMOND, Va. — A Virginia judge has granted a request to extend voter registration for 48 hours following technical issues that caused the commonwealth's voter registration portal to shut down for hours on Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>U.S. District Judge John A. Gibney, Jr. in Richmond gave the order Wednesday. The shutdown of the state’s website caused “a tremendous harm” to the people who want to register to vote, Gibney said.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>The deadline to register to vote is now 11:59 p.m. on Thursday Oct. 15. It includes both online and in-person registration.</p>
                    <p>“Today’s agreement to extend the voter registration deadline is a big win for democracy. Any eligible Virginian who was not able to register to vote yesterday can now do so,” said Attorney General Herring<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>“I have made it a top priority over the last several months to protect Virginians’ right to vote by making it as easy, safe and secure as possible, and this agreement is no different. I will continue to fight to make sure that every eligible Virginian can vote in this crucial election and that their vote will count.”</p>

                    <p>An accidentally cut cable caused the entire Virginia voter registration system to go down for hours on the last day to register to vote before election day, according to the Virginia Information Technology Agency (VITA). Just before 3:30 p.m., the Virginia Department of Elections tweeted out that the <a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">registration portal</a> was back up and functioning properly.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Virginians are once again able to register to vote online with identification, or in-person at their voter registrar's offices.</p>
                    <p>VITA &nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/vaELECT/status/1316012911031017482?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted that a fiber cut</a> near Route 10 in Chester, Virginia was to blame for Tuesday's outage.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"Technicians learned that a Verizon fiber had been inadvertently struck as part of activities related to a Chesterfield County roadside utilities project, located off of Route 10 in Chester, Virginia," VITA said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>There was no time estimate given on when the problem would be fixed.</p>
                    <p>"Due to a network outage, the Citizen Portal is temporarily unavailable," the Virginia Department of Elections posted on their registration website Tuesday morning. "We are working with our network providers to restore service as quickly as possible."&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Northam said during his Tuesday afternoon coronavirus briefing how he does not appear to have the authority to extend the voter registration deadline, according to state code, and this would come from the courts. However, the governor expressed support for a court order to extend the deadline.</p>
                    <p>“I look forward to [the courts] assisting us and making sure we can extend the deadline,” Northam said.</p>

<!--more--><span><a href="https://www.purpose.jobs/midwest-salary-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Dana%20Todd.jpg?width=1600&amp;name=Dana%20Todd.jpg" alt="Dana Todd" width="1600" srcset="https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Dana%20Todd.jpg?width=800&amp;name=Dana%20Todd.jpg 800w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Dana%20Todd.jpg?width=1600&amp;name=Dana%20Todd.jpg 1600w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Dana%20Todd.jpg?width=2400&amp;name=Dana%20Todd.jpg 2400w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Dana%20Todd.jpg?width=3200&amp;name=Dana%20Todd.jpg 3200w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Dana%20Todd.jpg?width=4000&amp;name=Dana%20Todd.jpg 4000w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Dana%20Todd.jpg?width=4800&amp;name=Dana%20Todd.jpg 4800w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></a></span><span>It wasn’t an easy time to find a new job, and Todd’s search eventually landed her in Chicago. Little did she know how much she’d grow to love the Midwest—and that she’d make it the place where she founded her next startup.</span>
<p>“When I decided to go back into entrepreneurship, it just made sense for me to grow Balodana here,” she explained. “We're building a slow fashion supply chain of international providers of custom made clothing, and it feels right to be in a city with major manufacturing history.”</p>
<p>That’s not all that made Todd fall in love with the Midwest, though.</p>
<p>“The startup scene here is not as overcrowded and competitive as the Bay Area and New York, so you can more easily find your place in the community, and it feels like you have so many people who want you to succeed. It's also got fantastic support for women,” she said. “Being a Midwesterner in part means you're not prone to hype or self-aggrandizing behavior, and that's led us to be overlooked for a very long time. We've got so many universities here and so many major industries represented, it's not surprising that we have a lot to offer in tech and innovation.”</p>
<p>Todd isn’t alone in her feelings about the Midwest. The Heartland is home to a fast-growing tech scene for a lot of different reasons—its affordable cost of living, ample amenities, friendly people, and more.</p>
<p>More and more, tech workers and entrepreneurs are starting to realize startups don’t have to live and die by major coastal cities. They can find their home in the Midwest—and, in a lot of ways, the Heartland can be an even better place to found an innovative tech company.</p>
<p>Curious about what the Heartland can offer you, your company, and your entrepreneurial spirit? Read on to learn why so many innovators are looking to the Midwest to found groundbreaking companies and invest in the next great wave of tech.</p>

<h2><span>Not Just Flyover Country</span></h2>
<p>There’s a name people give to a lot of Midwestern states: “Flyover country.” They think there’s so little to see there, you’re better off just flying over these states on your way to bustling coastal cities like San Francisco and New York City.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purpose.jobs/midwest-salary-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg?width=1600&amp;name=Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg" alt="Not just flyover country" width="1600" srcset="https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg?width=800&amp;name=Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg 800w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg?width=1600&amp;name=Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg 1600w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg?width=2400&amp;name=Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg 2400w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg?width=3200&amp;name=Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg 3200w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg?width=4000&amp;name=Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg 4000w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg?width=4800&amp;name=Not%20just%20flyover%20country.jpg 4800w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></a></p>
<p>We disagree. In fact, there’s another name we much prefer: The Heartland.</p>
<p>We think it captures a few distinct things about the Midwest: First, the amazing hearts of the people who live in these states. And second, that the Midwest literally makes up the central heart of our country.</p>
<p>But what’s in a name, really? There’s so much the Midwest has going for it, it doesn’t matter <em>what</em> you call the region.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purpose.jobs/midwest-salary-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg?width=512&amp;name=The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg" alt="The Midwest Economy" width="512" srcset="https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg?width=256&amp;name=The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg 256w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg?width=512&amp;name=The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg 512w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg?width=768&amp;name=The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg 768w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg?width=1024&amp;name=The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg 1024w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg?width=1280&amp;name=The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg 1280w, https://www.purpose.jobs/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg?width=1536&amp;name=The%20Midwest%20Economy.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a><br><span>People don’t realize how much the Midwest&nbsp;</span><em>truly</em><span>&nbsp;is the heart and soul of </span>the nation. The region comprises 19 percent of the <em>entire</em> United States GDP. It’s also home to nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies, 60 percent of all U.S. manufacturing, and 19 percent of all patents. 25 percent of computer science graduates come from the Midwest. And it’s no wonder tech workers are fleeing the super-high costs of living in major coastal cities to head for the Midwest—it’s home to seven of the top 10 most affordable states in the nation.</p>
<p>That’s not all, though.</p>
<p>The states that make up the Midwest—North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio—also comprise the fifth largest economy <em>in the entire world</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But to consider the merits of the Midwest <em>only</em> from an economic standpoint would be shortchanging the entire region. There’s even more to love about this area than what it has to offer financially.</p>

<h2><span>Things We Love About the Heartland</span></h2>
<p>Those who call the Midwest home already know there’s so much more to the region than what statistics can capture. These are just some of the reasons we (and so many others) are proud to call the Heartland our home.</p>

<h3><span>The People Here are Actually Really Nice</span></h3>
<p>While we don’t love <em>all </em>stereotypes about the Midwest (seriously, there’s so much more than cornfields), this one is actually true. The people who live in the Heartland are uncommonly kind, and research proves it.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0034434.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>2013 study by the University of Cambridge</span></a> surveyed more than 1.5 million people to assess their personality traits. Those who came from Midwestern states were found to have “moderately high levels of extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness,” by researchers. In other words, Midwesterners are outgoing, easy to get along with, and constantly thinking about how to help others out. It’s not just our opinion—it’s science.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>The Weather’s Really Not that Bad</span></h3>
<p>The Midwest does get a bad rap for its harsh winters, and there’s no way around the fact that they can be brutally cold, snow-filled, and long. But have you considered all the other seasons that come with living in the Heartland?</p>
<p>Sure, you have to get through winter. But you also get beautiful, mild spring weather. You get summers that are packed with festivals and events because no one takes nice weather for granted in the Midwest. And you get a long, warm fall that you can spend taking in the breathtaking colors of the changing leaves. Do you get that in San Francisco? No you do not.</p>

<h3><span>There’s Just as Much to Do as in Big Cities</span></h3>
<p>Despite that “flyover country” reputation, the Midwest offers entertainment that’s varied and high-quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detroit’s theater district is the second-largest in the world—second only to New York. Chicago is well known for being the place where famous comedians like Tina Fey, Fred Willard, and Eugene Levy got their starts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you know the dining in the Heartland is top notch. In addition to several cities that boast Michelin-starred establishments, lesser known restaurants serve up the freshest of local fare—with all those farms around, the farm-to-table scene is a foodie’s dream.</p>

<h3><span>You Want Wide Open Spaces? We Got ‘Em</span></h3>
<p>For people who live in San Francisco and New York City, the dream is having ample closet space or a stoop with room for a barbeque. Not true in the Midwest, where a yard or even a home with acreage is well within grasp for many people.</p>
<p>While an acre of land in San Francisco will run you a staggering average of $3.2 million, in Midwestern cities, an acre costs, on average, just tens of thousands. And for those who want <em>really</em> wide open spaces? The Midwest is home to North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas—four of the least densely populated states in the entire nation.</p>

<h3><span>High Standard of Living, Low </span><em><span>Cost</span></em><span> of Living</span></h3>
<p>One of the biggest selling points for making a move to the Midwest is the region’s affordability. According to the US News, seven of the nation’s top 10 most affordable states—Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri—are in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Those who dream of owning a home or starting a family will see how much further their dollars go in a Midwestern state than a coastal big city, and that’s appealing enough. But it becomes almost irresistible when you consider that you can have that low cost of living without sacrificing much in terms of salary.</p>

<h3><span>Tech Salaries Are Actually Comparable to the Coasts</span></h3>
<p>OK, so average salaries for tech jobs in the Midwest <em>are</em> generally lower on paper than in other big tech hubs.</p>
<p>But, when you factor in the cost of living, average salaries in the Midwest afford tech workers more disposable income than they’d have in San Francisco or New York City. And considering how much less it costs to rent or own property in the Heartland, a smaller salary can actually deliver a greater standard of living.</p>
<p>We break this all down in our Midwest Tech Jobs Report, which explores average salaries for common tech jobs in some of the Midwest’s most booming cities, and compares those salaries, cost of living, quality of life, and more to San Francisco and New York City.&nbsp;</p>

                </h3>

                <p>A visual diagram of a web page (screen) showing the future elements and content. The main goal is to plan and display the informational and logical content of the screen before the development phase begins. There are low fidelity wireframes with low presentational accuracy and, in contrast, high fidelity wireframes with higher content detail.</p>

                                    <li data-dropdown="">
                <h3>
                    
                </h3>

                <p>The simplest and fastest visual representation of a future web page or interface. Remotely represents how and what information will be located on the screen. It can be compared to a paper sketch.</p>
            </li>
        
                                    <li data-dropdown="">
                <h3>
                    
                </h3>

                <p>In order to quickly show the client or the development team how the information should be presented on the future web page (screen). This, in turn, helps to assess the development of the project and remotely imagine what the website will be like.</p>
            </li>
        
                                    <li data-dropdown="">
                <h3>
                    
                </h3>

                <p>A detailed (sometimes clickable) layout of a web page or application that is as close to the final design as possible. It also serves to test the user experience scenario at an early stage.</p>
            </li>
        
                                    <li data-dropdown="">
                <h3>
                    
                </h3>

                <p>For creating and testing layouts for more or less complex interfaces or websites where it is important to convey the accuracy and nuances of visual architecture and UX, therefore reducing the risks of misunderstanding when the project moves from the prototyping stage to the development stage.</p>
            </li>
        
                                    <li data-dropdown="">
                <h3>
                    
                </h3>

                <div>
                    <p>With the help of <strong>Low fidelity</strong> wireframes, you can very quickly and without having in-depth knowledge of web development show the future visual placement of information on web pages. Great for initial design and content planning for standard websites, interfaces, and applications.</p>

<p>Creating <strong>High fidelity</strong> wireframes requires a lot of time and expertise, but they are indispensable for creating complex interfaces where you need to see user interaction and test different UX scenarios before starting to work on the design.</p>

<p>For those just joining us, news broke last week about the jailbreaking of <a href="https://www.apple.com/euro/mac/shared/docs/Apple_T2_Security_Chip_Overview.pdf" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Apple’s T2 security processor in recent Macs</a>. If you haven't read it yet, <a href="https://blog.t8012.dev/on-bridgeos-t2-research/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">you can catch up on the story here</a>, and try this out yourself at home <a href="https://checkra.in/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">using the latest build of checkra1n</a>. So far we’ve stated that you must put the computer into DFU before you can run checkra1n to jailbreak the T2 and that remains true, however today we are introducing a demo of replacing a target Mac's EFI and releasing details on the T2 debug interface.</p><p>In order to build their products unlike app developers Apple has to debug the core operating system. This is how firmware, the kernel and the debugger itself are built and debugged. From the earliest days of the iPod, Apple has built specialized debug probes for building their products. <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/03/08/iphone-hack-what-dev-fused-iphones-are-and-why-theyre-important/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">These devices are leaked</a> from Apple headquarters and their factories and have traditionally had monkey related names such as the “<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Kong_Cable" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Kong</a>”, “<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Kanzi_Cable" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Kanzi</a>” and “<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Chimp_Cable" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Chimp</a>”. They work by allowing access to special debug pins of the CPU, (which for <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/debug-visibility-and-trace/coresight-architecture/serial-wire-debug" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">ARM devices is called Serial Wire Debug</a> or SWD), as well as other chips via JTAG and UART. <a href="https://blog.senr.io/blog/jtag-explained" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">JTAG is a powerful protocol</a> allowing direct access to the components of a device and access generally provides the ability to circumvent most security measures. Apple has even spoken about their debug capabilities <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Krstic.pdf" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">in a BlackHat talk</a> describing the security measures in effect. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/31/internal-usb-c-diagnostic-tool/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">even deployed versions of these</a> to their retail locations allowing for repair of their iPads and Macs.</p><h2 id="the-bonobo-in-the-myst">The Bonobo in the Myst</h2><p>Another hardware hacker and security researcher <a href="http://ramtin-amin.fr/#tristar" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Ramtin Amin did work last year</a> to create an effective <a href="https://shop.lambdaconcept.com/home/37-bonobo-debug-cable.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">clone of the Kanzi cable</a>. This combined with the checkm8 vulnerability from <a href="https://twitter.com/axi0mX" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">axi0mX</a> allows iPhones 5s - X to be debugged. </p><p>One of the interesting questions is how does the Macs <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-2/revive-or-restore-mac-firmware-apdebea5be51/mac" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">share a USB port </a>with both the Intel CPU (macOS) and the T2 (bridgeOS) for DFU. &nbsp;These are essentially separate computers inside of the case sharing the same pins. &nbsp;Schematics of the MacBook leaked from Apple’s vendors (a quick search with a part number and “schematic”), and analysis of the USB-C firmware update payload show that there is a component on each port which is tasked with both multiplexing (allowing the port to be shared) as well as terminating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#PD" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">USB power delivery (USB-PD)</a> for the charging of the MacBook or connected devices. &nbsp;Further analysis shows that this port is shared between the following:<br></p><ul><li>The Thunderbolt controller which allows the port to be used by macOS as Thunderbolt, USB3 or DisplayPort</li><li>The T2 USB host for DFU recovery</li><li>Various UART serial lines</li><li>The debug pins of the T2</li><li>The debug pins of the Intel CPU for debugging EFI and the kernel of macOS</li></ul><p><br>Like the above documentation related to the iPhone, the debug lanes of a Mac are only available if enabled via the T2. &nbsp;Prior to the checkm8 bug this required a specially signed payload from Apple, meaning that Apple has a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/17/11031902/apple-encryption-fbi-san-bernardino-backdoor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">skeleton key to debug any device</a> including production machines. &nbsp;Thanks to checkm8, any T2 can be demoted, and the debug functionality can be enabled. &nbsp;Unfortunately Intel has placed large amounts of <a href="https://thunderbolttechnology.net/developer-application">information about the Thunderbolt controllers</a> and <strong>protocol under NDA</strong>, meaning that it has not been properly researched leading to a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/thunderstrike-mac-osx-bootkit/7164/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">string</a> of <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/thunderstrike-2-rootkit-can-now-infect-macs-remotely" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">vulnerabilities</a> over the years.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/10/USB_Type-C_Receptacle_Pinout.png" alt=""

sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Given that the USB-C port on the Mac does many things, it is necessary to indicate to the multiplexer what device inside the Mac you’d like to connect too. &nbsp;The USB-C port specification provides pins for this exact purpose (CC1/CC2) as well as detecting the orientation of the cable allowing for it to be reversible. &nbsp;On top of the CC pins runs another low speed protocol called USB-PD or USB power delivery. &nbsp;It is primarily used to negotiate power requirements between chargers(sources) and devices (sinks). &nbsp;USB-PD also allows for arbitrary packets of information in what are called “Vendor Defined Messages” or VDMs.</p><h2 id="apple-s-usb-pd-extensions">Apple’s USB-PD Extensions</h2><p>The VDM allows Apple to trigger actions and specify the target of a USB-C connection. &nbsp;We have discovered USB-PD payloads that <strong>cause the T2 to be rebooted and for the T2 to be held into a DFU state</strong>. &nbsp;Putting these two actions together, we can cause the T2 to restart ready to be jailbroken by checkra1n without any user interaction. &nbsp;While we haven’t tested a Apple Serial Number Reader, we suspect it works in a similar fashion, allowing the devices ECID and Serial Number to be read from the T2’s DFU reliably. &nbsp;The Mac also speaks USB-PD to other devices, such as when an iPad Pro is connected in DFU mode. &nbsp;<br><strong>Apple needs to document the entire set of VDM messages</strong> used in their products so that consumers can understand the security risks. &nbsp;The set of commands we issue are unauthenticated, and even if they were they were undocumented and thus un-reviewed. &nbsp;<strong>Apple could have prevented this scenario</strong> by requiring that some physical attestation occurs during these VDMs such as holding down the power button at the same time.</p><p>Taking all this information into account, we can string it together to reflect a real world attack. &nbsp;By creating a specialized device <strong>about the size of a power charger</strong>, we can place a T2 into DFU mode, run checkra1n, replace the EFI and upload a key logger to capture all keys. &nbsp;This is possible even though macOS is un-altered (the logo at boot is for effect but need not be done). &nbsp;This is because in Mac portables <strong>the keyboard is directly connected to the T2</strong> and passed through to macOS.</p><p>PlugNPwn is the entry into DFU directly from connecting a cable to the DFU port (if it doesn't show, it may be your AdBlock: <a

However, so far most of our readers still like our non-standard Deep Learning tutorial.</em></p><p>Typically, AI is demonstrated as solving various toy problems. AI plays chess and Go, AI plays video games, AI makes people dance. It is time to stop this madness and finally apply AI in a meaningful way. Therefore, we proudly present the dish-o-tron. The dish-o-tron is an AI system designed to solve an actual real-world problem impacting millions of people around the world every day: facing dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink.</p><div id="attachment_77683"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77683" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-250x107.png" alt="dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink" width="250" height="107" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-250x107.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-700x300.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-768x329.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-1536x659.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-120x51.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77683">dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink – a real-world problem</p></div><p>Reading this blog series will equip you with the ultimate power to solve this long-lasting problem in your community kitchen once and for all by using state-of-the-art AI technology.</p><h2>The dish-o-tron</h2><p>At first glance, the dish-o-tron is an inconspicuous, well-positioned webcam in the kitchen observing the shared kitchen sink. In its natural state the dish-o-tron is just happy and enjoys life. The dish-o-tron doesn’t care whether you prefer tea or coffee and it likes all kinds of kitchen talk. However, there is one single thing that the dish-o-tron absolutely hates: watching someone put dirty dishes in the community sink.</p><p>Detecting dirty dishes in the sink enrages the peace-loving dish-o-tron so much that it starts beeping. The only way to return it to its natural peaceful state and thus stopping the noise is to admit one’s mistake and remove all dirty dishes from the community sink, leaving it neat and clean again.</p><p>Building the dish-o-tron requires three high-level steps:</p><ul><li>Gathering and preparing data</li><li>Training an AI model</li><li>Deployment of the model</li></ul><p>In the following, we will discuss these steps further.</p><h2>Gathering and preparing data</h2><p>Trying to solve real-world problems with AI often starts with the realisation that there is little or even no data available. This issue prevents many problem solvers from actually solving the problem. “If only data collection had started years ago!”, they say, “then we could now actually solve the problem”. While this is a reasonable thought, it simply doesn’t help.</p><p>Consoling users currently facing a problem by saying that it is necessary to gather lots of data for quite some time before we can start building a solution is at least challenging. Typically a more promising approach is to build a system addressing the problem which is able to improve over time.</p><p>In this way, we will not solve the problem completely in the first step; however, we will tackle the problem right away and put ourselves in a position to iteratively adjust the solution to match the requirements which also become more and more clear while working on the problem.</p><p>Since our problem is unique in a sense that there is no Kaggle dataset readily available, we start our journey to building the dish-o-tron by doing our best to collect a suitable dataset for a first working system. Here, we will make videos of various kitchen sinks clean and not clean and split them up into a first labeled dataset.</p><p>In this way, we started collecting the DIRTY-DISHES-DATASET with thousands of pictures that we will share with you in the next article.</p><div id="attachment_77687"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77687" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-250x151.png" alt="sample images from the dirty-dishes dataset" width="250" height="151" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-250x151.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-700x424.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-768x465.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-120x73.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset.png 1004w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77687">sample images from the dirty-dishes dataset</p></div><h2>Training an AI model</h2><p>Not so long ago, training an AI model was tedious and required expert knowledge. In many cases this is still true today. Depending on the problem, we have to figure out a suitable model architecture and feature engineering and this requires some experimentation before we can train a suitable AI model. This is another issue which prevents problem solvers from building a solution tackling the whole problem even if data is available.</p><p>Fortunately, image classification is one of the best understood use cases in AI. There are lots of established best practices regarding model architectures and training of models. Among others this led to two things:</p><ul><li>High-level software libraries such as fast.ai which abstract away lots of the nitty-gritty details of image classification, providing a black-box kind of approach where state-of-the-art practises are simply utilised without burdening the user with the details.</li><li>Machine Learning as a service offerings from various public cloud providers such as automl and rekognition allowing training of image classification models on custom data in a few simple steps.</li></ul><p>Both approaches will typically not lead to the absolutely best solution. However, most of the time this is not necessary and ‘good enough’ will be just fine and a nice trade-off between time &amp; money spent vs. result. For our first version of the dish-o-tron, we will employ the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoML Service</a> from Google Cloud to train a first model.</p><p>We can use various tools to inspect the model and try to explain if the black box learns what we expect.</p><div id="attachment_77689"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77689" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png" alt="visualizing what the dish-o-tron model has actually learned" width="250" height="191" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-700x535.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-768x587.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-120x92.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png 1412w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77689">Visualizing what the model has actually learned.</p></div><p>The training of the AI model with AutoML and its technical details will be discussed in a follow-up blog post.</p><h2>Deployment of the model</h2><p>Having an AI model generally will not solve an actual real-life problem. For a viable solution, the AI model has to be integrated into a suitable context. Many times, this is the key step to generating any value at all. Nevertheless, this step is often postponed to the distant future after “collecting high quality data” and “building the best AI model”. This is, more often than not, a mistake because integrating the model into its context poses various challenges on its own. Hence, it should not be ignored and instead tackled early in order to learn and identify the associated challenges.</p><p>While building the dish-o-tron, we tried multiple options to run the model. We deployed it on a Pi Zero which is a really small and cheap device that can be glued anywhere with a small powerbank. But it is rather slow. We ran the model in the browser using our notebook’s webcam with TensorFlow.js. We used the Google AIY Kit, which is much faster than the Pi Zero and also comes with a beeper and blinking lights (but it is quite old and deploying state-of-the-art models is hacky). Finally, we used the Google Coral device, which is made for this kind of workload and well-integrated into Google AutoML but comes with a price tag.</p><p>The community kitchen is a special place. It’s a place where rumors are born, where gossip is produced and where you can openly chat about the most secret secrets of your company! That’s why dish-o-tron is living on the edge. Edge devices enable you to run audio and video analytics AND respect the privacy of your community kitchen. No image is transferred to the cloud. Nothing is saved. Dish-o-tron sees and forgets.</p><div id="attachment_77691"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77691" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png" alt="various edge devices" width="250" height="85" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-700x237.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-768x261.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-1536x521.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-2048x695.png 2048w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-120x41.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77691">Various edge devices</p></div><p>Moreover, the hardware we consider and buy in order to actually build the dish-o-tron will establish basic conditions for our solution space. In other words, we have to mind that it is possible to painlessly deploy the AI model on our preferred edge device. For the first version of the dish-o-tron, we decided to use a Google AIY kit (see video below). For the next version, we chose a Google Coral edge device, which allows us to run advanced computer vision tasks on a Raspberry-size mini computer. Fortunately, AutoML allows us to export models in a viable format.</p><div id="attachment_77693"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77693" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png" alt="Google coral device" width="250" height="131" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-700x366.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-768x401.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-1536x803.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-120x63.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77693">Google coral device</p></div><p>The construction of the dish-o-tron including the deployment of the model on the Coral device and its technical details will be discussed in an upcoming blog post.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>AI research has brought us new technology that can solve problems that couldn’t be solved before. Have you read the book <em>AI superpowers</em> by Kai-Fu Lee? He says that you don’t need to be one of the best AI researchers any more to apply AI and find new business opportunities. You need to collect (lots of) data and can “just” use existing algorithms, services and open source frameworks. Well, in our opinion building AI solutions is not easy – but it is indeed getting easier and easier every day.</p><p>See the first prototype running on the google AIY kit here (mind the green/red LED at the box):</p><p>Follow this blog series if you want to know how to build and run such a model on an edge device yourself. Building the dish-o-tron will fundamentally change the way you experience the community kitchen. Instead of being a place of constant anger and hostility, the community kitchen will become a peaceful meeting ground for sharing ideas and connecting with co-workers.</p><p>In the upcoming blog posts, we will guide you through the process of building your own dish-o-tron for your community kitchen sink. Hence, we will tackle a real-world problem and playfully learn how to build and improve an AI system from scratch.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>I recently became interested in two seemingly disparate things: Scheme/Racket and symbolic logic, so I decided to have some fun by combining those two into a little project. The marriage is actually a little less weird than it seems, since Racket has very robust tools for lexing and parsing due to its focus on meta-programming. In this post, we'll go over some strategies for implementing a simple parser, with concepts that could easily be extended to parse other things like JSON or even your own programming language.</p>
<h2>What is propositional logic?</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, it would be good to introduce what we'll be parsing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus">Propositional logic</a> is a branch of symbolic logic that defines a grammar and set of rules for stating propositions. With this, we can define an argument such as:</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>John&nbsp;goes&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;park.</mtext><mspace linebreak="newline"></mspace><mtext>Maria&nbsp;goes&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;park.</mtext><mspace linebreak="newline"></mspace><mtext>Therefore,&nbsp;John&nbsp;and&nbsp;Maria&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;park.</mtext><mspace linebreak="newline"></mspace></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textnormal{John goes to the park.} \newline
\textnormal{Maria goes to the park.} \newline
\textnormal{Therefore, John and Maria go to the park.} \newline</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p>Or symbolically:</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>:</mo><mo>=</mo><mtext>John&nbsp;goes&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;park</mtext><mspace linebreak="newline"></mspace><mi>Q</mi><mo>:</mo><mo>=</mo><mtext>Maria&nbsp;goes&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;park</mtext><mspace linebreak="newline"></mspace><mi>P</mi><mtext>  </mtext><mo separator="true">.</mo><mtext>  </mtext><mi>Q</mi><mtext>  </mtext><mo>∴</mo><mi>P</mi><mo>∧</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P := \textnormal{John goes to the park} \newline 
Q := \textnormal{Maria goes to the park} \newline
P \; \ldotp \; Q \; \therefore P \land Q</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p>Propositional logic is constrained to sentences that are observational statements like "John goes to the park." There are no variables, and no quantifiers like <em>all</em> or <em>some</em>.</p>
<h3>The Symbols</h3>
<p>With propositional logic informally introduced, let's look at the symbols we have at our disposal, which will need to be worked into our parser:</p>

<p>Note that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>P</mtext><mo>→</mo><mtext>Q</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{P} \rarr \text{Q}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is read as "<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>If&nbsp;P,&nbsp;then&nbsp;Q</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{If P, then Q}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>".</p>
<h2>Parsing in Racket</h2>
<p>Okay, that's enough theory, let's get to coding. The main libraries at our disposal are found in the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/parser-tools/">parser-tools</a> package, but the documentation for these tools was confusing to me, and setting up a simple parser was not very ergonomic. Fortunately, there is another way of building a parser: the Brag package.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/brag/">Brag</a> (Better Racket AST Generator) is a package that allows us to define a grammar in standard BNF form, then easily lex and parse that grammar. Simply install with <code>raco pkg install brag</code> so we can use it.</p>
<h3>Step One: Defining our grammar</h3>
<p>Let's create a new file in our directory called <code>grammar.rkt</code> and put <code>#lang brag</code> at the top. This is the file we will use to define our BNF grammar. For propositional logic, that grammar can be represented elegantly, like this:</p>
<div data-language="racket"><pre><code><span>#lang brag</span>
sentence: ATOMIC | complex
complex: LPAR sentence RPAR | sentence connective sentence | NOT sentence
connective: AND | OR | IF | IFF</code></pre></div>
<p>In Brag, any string in all caps is interpreted as a token to be included in our lexer, while those not in caps are types of expressions that we must define elsewhere in the grammar. We define the tokens ATOMIC, NOT, AND, OR, IF, IFF as analogues for the symbols we discussed earlier. We also have the tokens LPAR and RPAR to represent parentheses.</p>
<p>Here, we are successively breaking down the syntax of the language into its constituent parts. A <code>sentence</code> can be either <code>ATOMIC</code> (e.g <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Q</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) or <code>complex</code>. A <code>complex</code> expression is any sentence within parentheses, or two sentences joined by a connective, or a negation of a sentence. Finally, a connective can be AND, OR, IF, or IFF.</p>
<h3>Step Two: Creating the lexer</h3>
<p>Let's create another racket file in the same directory called <code>parser.rkt</code>. We also need to import <code>brag/support</code>, our grammar from <code>grammar.rkt</code> and the package <code>br-parser-tools/lex</code>, which is a fork of the default racket parser tools used by brag. To install this, simply <code>raco pkg install br-parser-tools</code>. You should now have this:</p>
<div data-language="racket"><pre><code><span>#lang racket</span>
<span>(</span><span>require</span> brag/support<span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>require</span> br-parser-tools/lex<span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>require</span> <span>"grammar.rkt"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can now define our tokenize function, which will take in an input string, and output a list of tokens. It will have the form of something like this:</p>
<div data-language="racket"><pre><code><span>(</span><span>define</span> <span>(</span><span>tokenize</span> ip<span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>define</span> lexer
      	<span>(</span><span>lexer-src-pos</span>
            
       		<span>[</span><span>(</span><span>eof</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>define</span> <span>(</span><span>next-token</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>lexer</span> ip<span>)</span><span>)</span>
    next-token<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All we are doing here is setting up the imported function <code>lexer-src-pos</code> which will take a list of rules for matching tokens and return a function that lexes them. Then, by calling <code>next-token</code> we run this lexer function recursively on the input port until we reach the special token <code>eof</code>, at which point we return void.</p>
<p>We can now add in the rules for the tokens we want to lex for:</p>
<div data-language="racket"><pre><code><span>(</span><span>define</span> <span>(</span><span>tokenize</span> ip<span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>define</span> lexer
      	<span>(</span><span>lexer-src-pos</span>
       		<span>[</span><span>(</span><span>char-range</span> <span>#\P</span> <span>#\Z</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'ATOMIC</span> lexeme<span>)</span><span>]</span> 
       		<span>[</span><span>"^"</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'AND</span> lexeme<span>)</span><span>]</span> 
			<span>[</span><span>"v"</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'OR</span> lexeme<span>)</span><span>]</span> 
			<span>[</span><span>"~"</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'NOT</span> lexeme<span>)</span><span>]</span> 
			<span>[</span><span>"-&gt;"</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'IF</span> lexeme<span>)</span><span>]</span> 
			<span>[</span><span>"&lt;-&gt;"</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'IFF</span> lexeme<span>)</span><span>]</span> 
			<span>[</span><span>"("</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'LPAR</span> lexeme<span>)</span><span>]</span> 
			<span>(</span><span>")"</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'RPAR</span> lexeme<span>)</span><span>)</span> 
       		<span>[</span><span>whitespace</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'WHITESPACE</span> lexeme #:skip? <span>#t</span><span>)</span><span>]</span> 
       		<span>[</span><span>(</span><span>eof</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> 
    <span>(</span><span>define</span> <span>(</span><span>next-token</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>lexer</span> ip<span>)</span><span>)</span> 
    next-token<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how each of these rules are enclosed in brackets, where the first expression is the pattern to lex, and the second expression is what to return with that pattern. You can return anything you want (or add side effects) but we will return the <code>token</code> struct built into Brag, since this will integrate well with the package's parsing capabilities.</p>
<p>The <code>token</code> struct takes two inputs: the name (which we defined in our grammar!), and the lexeme, which is the string returned from the pattern we just lexed. So, when we add <code> <span>[</span><span>"^"</span> <span>(</span><span>token</span> <span>'AND</span> lexeme<span>)</span><span>]</span></code>, we are lexing for the string <code>"^"</code> under the syntactic rules for the token <code>AND</code> defined in our grammar file.</p>
<p>Also note that the lex package comes with some functions useful for matching tokens like <code>char-range</code> and <code>whitespace</code> which we use here too.</p>
<h3>Step Three: Parse and Display</h3>
<p>We now have a function that can tokenize any input string, so let's parse those tokens now, which is really as simple as:</p>
<div data-language="racket"><pre><code><span>(</span><span>define</span> stx
	<span>(</span><span>parse</span> <span>(</span><span>tokenize</span> <span>(</span><span>open-input-string</span> <span>"P^Q"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>(</span><span>syntax-&gt;datum</span> stx<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Parser complete! And as promised, the grammar and parser files amount to just <strong>33 lines</strong>.</p>
<p>This produces a list of tokens, which for the input <code>"P^Q"</code> is </p>
<div data-language="racket"><pre><code><span>'</span><span>(</span><span>sentence</span> 
    <span>(</span><span>complex</span> 
      <span>(</span><span>sentence</span> <span>"P"</span><span>)</span> 
      <span>(</span><span>connective</span> <span>"^"</span><span>)</span> 
      <span>(</span><span>sentence</span> <span>"Q"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is exactly the data structure we want. The entire string is a sentence, with a complex sentence within it, containing the tokens P, ^, and Q.</p>
<p>Let's try it on something a bit more complicated: <code>"(P-&gt;Q) &lt;-&gt; ~R"</code>:</p>
<div data-language="racket"><pre><code><span>'</span><span>(</span><span>sentence</span> 
    <span>(</span><span>complex</span> <span>(</span><span>sentence</span> <span>(</span><span>complex</span> 
      <span>"("</span> <span>(</span><span>sentence</span> <span>(</span><span>complex</span> <span>(</span><span>sentence</span> <span>"P"</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>connective</span> <span>"-&gt;"</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>sentence</span> <span>"Q"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>")"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>(</span><span>connective</span> <span>"&lt;-&gt;"</span><span>)</span> 
      <span>(</span><span>sentence</span> <span>(</span><span>complex</span> <span>"~"</span> <span>(</span><span>sentence</span> <span>"R"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, this nested structure is exactly what we want.</p>
<h2>Where to go from here?</h2>
<p>We can now parse any symbolic sentence in propositional logic. Parsing is a great first step, but on it's own, it doesn't do very much. With the data structures we produce though, we could create programs that visualize the logical tree, derive theorems and arguments with a solver, among others. The same strategies we used here could also be applied to parsing JSON or other structured languages.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In my job as a scientific software developer, I tend to write a lot of code. And most people who haven’t been through a Computer Science degree tend to think that CS is “just” about slinging code at the screen and then running it. I have a good working relationship with many of my colleagues and co-workers with other backgrounds… Physics, Climate Science, Biology, etc. But when it comes to developing software, I get the distinct impression that people think, “Hey, how hard could this be?! We just write down a few instructions about what we want the computer to do, hit the execute button and the, ‘Blamo!’, we get our answer!”</p>

<p>The problem with that line of thinking is that it’s incredibly easy to write instructions that don’t mean what you think they mean. For example, your program could be completely uninterpretable by the computer. Furthermore, there is literally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">no way to tell whether your program will ever actually terminate</a> without actually executing it. And there are many, many, <em>many</em>, ways to write a program which make it “slow” to execute. “Slow” being… like <em>really</em> slow. Like it would take your entire lifetime or more to actually execute it. This final problem is one that I see most often when reading software written by people without a CS education. And fixing that is my job.</p>

<p>The thing about CS that people don’t realize is that it teaches you about the theory of computation, computability (i.e. can we actually compute something? We often take for granted that we can!), algorithm complexity, and all of the knowledge, logic and analysis techniques and help you compose a program that will run in the minimum amount of time or using the minimum amount of space.</p>

<p>Allow me to show you an example of a huge optimization that I made to a simple script written by a colleague.</p>

<p>In climate science we do a lot of downscaling. We take temperature and precipitation readings from a coarse scale Global Climate Model grid and map them to a fine scale local grid. Let’s say the global grid is 50x25 and the local grid is 1000x500. For each grid cell in the local grid, we want to know to which grid cell in the global grid it corresponds.</p>

<p>A simple way to think about this is that we want to minimize the distance between L[n] and G[n]. So a simple way to do the search would be:</p>

<pre><code>for each Local cell L[i]:
  for each Global cell G[j]:
     compute distance between L[i] and G[j]
  find the minimum distance in the set L[i] * G
  return the index of the minimum
</code></pre>

<p>It seems simple enough. However, if you look closely, you’ll notice that you have to do a <em>lot</em> of extra work. Look at the algorithm in terms of the size of the input.</p>

<pre><code>for each Local cell L[i]:                        # Do this L times
  for each Global cell G[j]:                     # Do this L x G times
     compute distance (d) between L[i] and G[j]  # Do this L x G times
  find the minimum distance in the set d[i*j]    # Read G cells L times (cost L x G)
  find the index whose cell matches the minimum  # Read G cells L times (cost L x G)
</code></pre>

<p>The code for this looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code>obs.lon &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.obs, 'lon')
obs.lat &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.obs, 'lat')
n.lon &lt;- length(obs.lon)
n.lat &lt;- length(obs.lat)

obs.lats &lt;- matrix(obs.lat, nrow=n.lon, ncol=n.lat, byrow=TRUE)
obs.lons &lt;- matrix(obs.lon, nrow=n.lon, ncol=n.lat)
obs.time &lt;- netcdf.calendar(nc.obs)

gcm.lon &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.gcm, 'lon')-360
gcm.lat &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.gcm, 'lat')
gcm.lats &lt;- matrix(gcm.lat, ncol=length(gcm.lat), nrow=length(gcm.lon),
                   byrow=TRUE)
gcm.lons &lt;- matrix(gcm.lon, ncol=length(gcm.lat), nrow=length(gcm.lon))
gcm.lons.lats &lt;- cbind(c(gcm.lons), c(gcm.lats))

# Figure out which GCM grid boxes are associated with each fine-scale grid point
# Confine search to 10 deg. x 10 deg. neighbourhood

dxy &lt;- 10
mdist &lt;- function(x, y)
    apply(abs(sweep(data.matrix(y), 2, data.matrix(x), '-')), 1, sum)
nn &lt;- list()
for (i in seq_along(obs.lons)) {
    if((i %% 500)==0) cat(i, '')
    gcm.lims &lt;- ((gcm.lons.lats[,1] &gt;= (obs.lons[i]-dxy)) &amp;
                 (gcm.lons.lats[,1] &lt;= (obs.lons[i]+dxy))) &amp;
                ((gcm.lons.lats[,2] &gt;= (obs.lats[i]-dxy)) &amp;
                 (gcm.lons.lats[,2] &lt;= (obs.lats[i]+dxy)))
    gcm.lims &lt;- which(gcm.lims)
    nn.min &lt;- which.min(mdist(c(obs.lons[i], obs.lats[i]),
                        gcm.lons.lats[gcm.lims,]))
    nn[[i]] &lt;- gcm.lims[nn.min]
}
nn &lt;- unlist(nn)
</code></pre>

<p>So, it seems like a simple algorithm. “Just” compute the distances and then find the minimum. But the way it was written, as the size of the number of local cells grows, our cost of computation grows by its product with the number of global grid cells. For Canadian ANUSPLIN data, there are 1068 x 510 cells (for a total of 544,680) and let’s say that our GCM has 50 x 25 cells (for a total of 1,250 cells). So the cost of the inner loop in “some computational unit” is:</p>



<p>where the  terms are constants that correspond to the cost of computing a distance between two points, finding the minimum point, and finding an array index. Really, we don’t care (much) about the constant terms, because they are not affected by the size of the input. So we can just clump them together and call the cost;</p>



<p>So for this set of input, our cost is </p>

<p>680 million.</p>

<p>That <em>seems</em> like a lot, but is it? Computers are fast, right? If we run the naive implementation that’s something like this:</p>

<p>it ends up taking 1668 seconds which is a little less than half an hour.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; source('BCCA/naive.implementation.R')
500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 ... 543000 543500 544000 544500 [1] "Elapsed Time"
    user   system  elapsed 
1668.868    8.926 1681.728 
</code></pre>

<p>But do we <em>need</em> for it to take 30 minutes? Here’s the thing. We’re comparing two grids together, both of which have tons of structure that we haven’t taken advantage of. For example the latitudes and longitudes in both the coarse and the fine grid are in sorted order. So if you want to search for a number, you don’t have to look at every single number. You can use a bisect algorithm where you look at the point in the middle and then decide which half of the array you want to search. Then searching the full space only costs you the log (base 2) of the search space.</p>

<p>The other major structure that we haven’t taken advantage of is the fact that the latitudes repeat themselves in the  dimension and the longitudes repeat themselves in the  dimension. So instead of doing an operation  times, we can do it  times. That’s a <em>huge</em> optimization.</p>

<p>What does that look like in pseudo-code?</p>

<pre><code>For each local[x]:
    bisect_search(local[x], Global[x])

For each local[y]:
    bisect_search(local[y], Global[y])

return a 2d grid of the search results for each dimension
</code></pre>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code>## Perform a binary search on the *sorted* vector v
## Return the array index of the element closest to x
find.nearest &lt;- function(x, v) {
    if (length(v) == 1) {
        return(1)
    }
    if (length(v) == 2) {
        return(which.min(abs(v - x)))
    }
    mid &lt;- ceiling(length(v) / 2)
    if (x == v[mid]) {
        return(mid)
    } else if (x &lt; v[mid]) {
        return(find.nearest(x, v[1:mid]))
    }
    else {
        return((mid - 1) + find.nearest(x, v[mid:length(v)]))
    }
}

regrid.one.dim &lt;- function(coarse.points, fine.points) {
    return(sapply(fine.points, find.nearest, coarse.points))
}

## Take a fine scale (e.g. ANUSPLINE) grid of latitudes and longitudes
## and find the indicies that correspond to a coarse scale (e.g. a GCM) grid
## Since the search is essentially a minimizing distance in 2 dimensions
## We can actually search independently in each dimensions separately (which
## is a huge optimization, making the run time x + y instead of x * y) and
## then reconstruct the indices to create a full grid
regrid.coarse.to.fine &lt;- function(coarse.lats, coarse.lons, fine.lats, fine.lons) {
    xi &lt;- regrid.one.dim(gcm.lon, obs.lon)
    yi &lt;- regrid.one.dim(gcm.lat, obs.lat)
    ## Two dimensional grid of indices
    xi &lt;- matrix(xi, ncol=length(fine.lats), nrow=length(fine.lons), byrow=F)
    yi &lt;- matrix(yi, ncol=length(fine.lats), nrow=length(fine.lons), byrow=T)
    return(list(xi=xi, yi=yi))
}

</code></pre>

<p>The cost for every bisection search is the log of the input size. Our input size is divided into X and Y space this time, so we’ll use , and  for Global, Local, X and Y.</p>



<p>Plugging in our numbers this gives us a cost estimate of 553,076. 553 thousand sounds a lot better than 680 million. Do we see that in the run time?</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ptm &lt;- proc.time(); rv &lt;- regrid.coarse.to.fine(gcm.lat, gcm.lon, obs.lat, obs.lon); print('Elapsed Time'); print(proc.time() - ptm)[1] "Elapsed Time"
   user  system elapsed 
  0.117   0.000   0.117 
&gt; str(rv)
List of 2
 $ xi: num [1:1068, 1:510] 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 ...
 $ yi: num [1:1068, 1:510] 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 ...
&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>0.117 seconds. What took us almost half an hour before, now takes us a little over  of a second.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; 1668.868 / .117
[1] 14263.83
</code></pre>

<p>Soooooo… I know that I’m trained to do this kind of work and it’s my job to know how to do these types of things. But even <em>I’m</em> surprised and self-impressed at how significant that speedup is. That’s a <em>14 thousand times</em> speedup.</p>

<p>This script used to take so long that it had to save its output to disk and be manually checked by a scientist before proceeding. Now you can compute it in the blink of an eye. This is a computation that we have to do hundreds of times, and this saves us days to weeks of computation time. And it increases the ability to interact with the system, helping us to get more value out of our scientists’ time… they’re not sitting around waiting for a computation to finish. It just does it.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that these epic performance improvements come without buying any larger computer systems, no parallelization or increase in complexity… in fact the code for the faster algorithm is actually simpler and more reusable! It’s pretty much an all around win, just by reading the code and having …</p></div></div>

almost unnoticeably to you. In this lesson, we’ll build a network client application, which does something similar to
your browser in this situation.</p><p>It all starts with an <em>address</em>: you want to send a message to your friend Alice, but your computer needs to know
<em>where</em> these messages should be sent for the message to be delivered to the right computer—just like you need to
provide a recipient address when you send an email.</p><p>We are used to one kind of address system: <em>domain names</em>, like <code>lowlvl.org</code> or <code>duckduckgo.com</code>. However, these
addresses are intended to be used by human beings; machines use another addressing system.
Internet protocol (or <em>IP</em>) addresses look like <code>192.168.0.1</code>. In order to find out which IP address we should use
for a domain name like <code>lowlvl.org</code>, we ask a <em>name server</em>, a computer with a well-known IP address like
<code>1.2.3.4</code>. A name server understands DNS, or the domain name service <em>protocol</em>. Protocols are languages in
which computers can talk to each other.</p><p>So why don't we give it a try? Let's translate a domain name into an IP address:</p><p>Below you see a code example written in Rust (if you are not familiar with the Rust syntax, you can refer to
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Book</a> and learn by example).</p><p>This should give you a taste of what it's like to work with computer networks. Now let's start looking into
what makes this code tick!</p></div></div><div><div><p>We have now seen how IP addresses are used in a small, imaginary network of two computers.
But just knowing an address isn’t enough to do something useful: machines need to follow a well-known
protocol to make sure they can communicate with each other in a predictable way. This is what the
Internet protocol suite, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a>,
is about: it's a standard collection of protocols used on the Internet.</p><p>The protocol suite consists of several protocols, of which we are interested in two: IP and UDP (later
we will also cover TCP and other protocols).</p><p>​<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> is the bread and butter of networking.
It serves as a foundation for high-level protocols. When computers exchange
messages, they encode them into IP <em>packets</em>, which you can view as individual
message units of up to 65 kilobytes in size. Usually, the operating system takes
care of the encoding for us and we don't need to do it manually, but it's still
good to know how it works under the hood, so let's see what a typical IP packet
looks like:</p><p>When you run this code, you see the destructured IP packet in a table. Each table cell contains an
individial field of the packet header. The header fields we set in code are highlighted in green—we
can skip the rest of them, for now.</p><p>On the right side, you can see the exact same packet represented in the
<em>hexadecimal</em> numerical system which is often used
to represent bytes because of its compactness (each single byte can be encoded by a hexadecimal
number ranging from <code>0x00</code> to <code>0xFF</code>, which <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=0xFF+in+decimal&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=answer">corresponds to decimal</a>
<code>0</code> to <code>255</code>). This demonstrates that the IP header is just a sequence of numbers that we can interpret
and represent in different ways. If you are not comfortable with hexadecimal numbers, you can refer to
the <a href="https://lowlvl.org/prerequisites/binary-and-hexadecimal-numbers">prerequisite lesson on number encoding</a>.</p><h2>User Datagram Protocol</h2><p>​<abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr>, or User Datagram Protocol, is a
thin layer above IP which adds some more contextual information for a message. A
UDP <abbr title="a word combination of data + telegram">datagram</abbr>
is also divided into a header and a payload. The fun thing about it is that an
entire UDP datagram is the <em>payload</em> of an IP packet! This is called
<em>encapsulation</em> and it's one of the core ideas in networking. A single layer of
the network stack like IP doesn’t know and doesn’t care about its payload, which
can be a protocol from the Internet protocol suite like TCP and UDP or even a
protocol defined by you.</p><p>UDP headers are only 8 bytes long. They contain source and destination <em>port numbers</em> which help to identify
different services running on the same computer—it's very common for a server to have many functions. Usually,
we designate a specific port number for a given service by convention. For example, name servers commonly use
the port number 53.</p><p>A UDP header also includes the total size of a datagram in bytes and a <em>checksum</em> which is used to verify
that the original network packet is not corrupted during transmission. And that's all it adds to the IP header!</p><p>Let's construct a UDP datagram header and add it to the previous example:</p><p>Now we are ready to move onto sending messages we have constructed
over the network!</p></div></div><div><div><p>Now we know how UDP datagrams and IP packets are constructed, but we
don't have to do this ourselves all the time. Instead, we can use
tools and functions provided by the operating system and the
standard library of our programming language. In Rust, these
functions are part of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/index.html"><code>std::net</code></a>
module.</p><p>We can use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.bind"><code>UdpSocket::bind</code></a>
function to construct <em>sockets</em>, which are virtual files that associate your program with a given port number.
All UDP datagrams incoming to this port will be redirected to your program by the operating system.</p><p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.send_to"><code>UdpSocket::send_to</code></a> can be used
to construct UDP datagrams from a given payload and send them over the network. We can wait for a response by using
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.recv_from"><code>UdpSocket::recv_from</code></a>
function, which returns an IP address and a port number of a sender along with the message payload. In the case of
the name server request, we can interpret the payload as an IP address. If we send a request for Alice’s address to
the name server, we should get it back in this response!</p><p>Let's give it a try:</p><p>When you run this code, you can find a list of all IP packets you send and receive on the right. You can browse the
contents of IP packet headers and UDP datagrams. You can also find contents of an original message represented in
hexadecimal format below the packet browser.</p><p>With everything we have learned, you should be ready for a final test. In this test, you need to send a message to
your friend Alice. You know that she uses the port number <code>1000</code>—but you don't know her IP address yet! Maybe the
name server can help?</p><p>Congratulations, you have finished this lesson!</p><p>In the next one, we will cover the topic of fragmentation. So far we have been dealing with small messages only,
but what if you want to send a larger file, like a photo to share with your friend? We will learn how to break
large messages into small parts and how to reconstruct original files in the next lesson.</p><p><span>If you would like to follow updates, you can<!-- --> <a href="https://eepurl.com/haHQUn">subscribe to our mailing list</a>.</span></p></div></div><div><div id="lesson-navigation"><ol><li data-step="1">Exchanging Messages</li><li data-step="2">Sockets and Datagrams</li><li data-step="3">Sockets API</li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In short, effective methods to come up with product ideas can be categorized along two dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">Organic ↔ Inorganic</a>. While organic ideas are solutions to problems you noticed in your own life, inorganic ideas are related to other people’s problems. Formulated differently, organic ideas grow out of the founders’ own experiences, while inorganic ideas don’t.</li>
  <li><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1243820706116198403">Bottom-up ↔ Top-down</a>. When you start only with a category in mind, you’re following a top-down approach, while if your ideation efforts start at some smaller scale you’re doing bottom-up ideation.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll discuss these distinctions in much more tangible terms in a moment. But first, just one more high-level observation. With the two dimensions at hand, we’re left with four distinct categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organic, Bottom-Up Ideation. (“Scratch your own itch”)</li>
  <li>Organic, Top-Down Ideation. (“Live in the future, then build what’s missing”)</li>
  <li>Inorganic, Bottom-Up Ideation. (“Idea extraction”)</li>
  <li>Inorganic, Top-Up Ideation. (“Idea safaris”)</li>
</ul>

<p>Different entrepreneurs swear by different ideation methods. But what they all have in common is that they focus on finding problems over ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Customers don’t pay for ideas; they pay for their problems to be solved.” - Nathan Barry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Focusing on ideas is dangerous because it often leads to clever products that no one wants.</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/gut.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>My humble opinion is that you should try all ideation methods at least once. Doing this will equip you with a broad arsenal of ideas that you can later put through the metaphorical <a href="https://tylertringas.com/business-ideas-meat-grinder/">“meat grinder”</a> (i.e. <a href="https://productideas.co/evaluation">evaluate</a> and <a href="https://productideas.co/validation">validate</a>).</p>

<p>In this essay I will not judge the different approaches (they’re all amazing!). My goal is merely to organize them within a common framework.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s dive in. (I discuss the different ideation methods in the order recommended by <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/validating_product_ideas">Patrick McKenzie</a>. However, feel free to approach them in any order you like.)</p>

<h2 id="organic-bottom-up-ideation">Organic, Bottom-Up Ideation</h2>

<p>Organic, bottom-up ideation is all about solving problems that you currently have yourself or had in the past. It’s a great method because the best ideas are often things that you notice rather than things that you purposefully come up with during a brainstorming session.</p>

<p>While “<a href="https://tylertringas.com/finding-micro-saas-business-ideas/">scratching your own itch</a>” might sound easy, it requires a lot of effort if you want to do it right. We all develop a certain blindness to our routines and daily processes. Hence, we need to actively turn the spotlight on and scrutinize all areas of our lives.</p>

<p>This includes your current job, your hobbies and all jobs you had in the past. For each of them ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What frictions did you encounter?</li>
  <li>What suboptimal processes did you notice?</li>
  <li>Did you found yourself wondering: “Why doesn’t someone make x?”</li>
  <li>What did you find frustrating? What made you think: “I shouldn’t have to x.”</li>
  <li>What would you spend money on without thinking if it existed?</li>
</ul>

<p>It makes a lot of sense to make it a habit to ask yourself this kind of questions regularly. With ideas, it’s like with radio frequency. You have to tune in to receive them and questions like the ones listed above will help you do that.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of organic, bottom up ideation is that <a href="https://levels.io/startups/">you’re an expert on your own problems</a> and hence in an ideal position to navigate the corresponding <a href="https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze">idea maze</a>.</p>

<p>However, the usefulness of organic, bottom-up ideation depends heavily on the kind of life you’re living. If you’re living an interesting life, full of intellectual adventures, you’ll have no problem spotting opportunities.</p>

<p>But if your life is more mundane, the ideas you’ll be able to come up with organically will be less promising.</p>

<p>For example, most college students will only be able to usual problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t know what I should do next Friday.</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to find a sexual partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only if you’re doing things that others don’t, you’ll be able to see what everyone else is missing.</p>

<p>An obvious solution to the “boring life”-problem is to start living a more interesting life and being more curious. This is what organic, top-down ideation is all about.</p>

<h2 id="organic-top-down-ideation">Organic, Top-Down Ideation</h2>

<p>A very poetic way to describe organic, top-down ideation was coined by Paul Graham: “Live in the future, then build what’s missing.” Formulated differently, if no promising ideas grow out of your own experiences, it’s time to become the kind of person who has more interesting product ideas.</p>

<p>This means that you purposefully pick a field (ideally one that will have a large impact in the future) and then immerse yourself in it. Hence, instead of starting with a specific problem you pick a new field and then try to get to the edge of it.</p>

<p>The most common way to do this is to get a job at a company in the space. Alternatively, you can, of course, also spend your free time dabbling in the field. For example, if you’re convinced that soon everyone will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IoT devices</a>, you could start by <a href="https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror">building a smart mirror</a> to get your feet wet and then move on to more ambitious projects.</p>

<p>If you pick a promising field, the organic, top-down approach will allow you to spot many new problems worth solving. Ideally, you pick a field that is on the verge of becoming the next big thing. After all, <a href="http://jakobgreenfeld.com/trends">everything is easier when you’re riding a wave</a>. Then the problems you want to be solved, a few years later, millions of other people will want to be solved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[S]ince the most successful startups generally ride some wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for waves and ask how one could benefit from them. Looking for waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method. If you’re at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you don’t have to look for waves; you are the wave.” - <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">Paul Graham</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interesting method to find industries and professions you could start to immerse yourself in is <a href="https://escapefromcubiclenation.libsyn.com/how-do-i-choose-which-business-to-start-">Pamela Slim’s month-long ideation exercise</a>. Each day you write down in a notebook how you respond to different things that occur in your life. After a while this will allow you to observe yourself like a scientist would observe an ant. Ideally, you’ll then be able to find patterns in the things that excite you. These are the things you should spend more time on.</p>

<p>A related useful method is to apply the principles of “curiosity overload” (h/t Daniel Priestley). Attend every event, listen to every sales pitch and subscribe to as much marketing material as you can find. If you bombard your brain this way, you’ll eventually notice interesting themes. As with Pamela Slim’s exercise, curiosity overload allows you to find out what kind of ideas get you excited. Moreover, it’s very likely that you stumble upon interesting inefficiencies and suboptimal processes. After all, if you fill your cup for a while it will eventually start pouring over.</p>

<p>Alternatively or supplementary, follow <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">Paul Graham’s advice:</a> “Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it’s probably worthwhile to join it.”</p>

<p>The biggest downside of organic, top-down ideation is that it takes a lot of time. You can’t expect to get to the edge of a new field in just a few weeks. More realistically, we’re talking about years. This may only be viable if you’re young. Hence, inorganic ideation methods can be invaluable.</p>

<h2 id="inorganic-bottom-up-ideation">Inorganic, Bottom-Up Ideation</h2>

<p>Rather than focusing on problems that you know from your own experiences, you can also focus on other people’s problems.</p>

<p>If you talk to people to find their specific pains, we call this inorganic, bottom-up ideation since we’re again starting with specific problems of a single person. It’s just that this person is no longer you. As with organic, bottom-up ideation, the goal is to discover the most painful problems (processes) that you can then put through the “<a href="https://productideas.co/validation">meat grinder</a>”.</p>

<p>However, while it is already difficult to become aware of suboptimal processes and problems in your own life, it’s even harder to do this for other people. Everyone becomes to some extent numb to the pain they experience in their daily lives.</p>

<p>In theory, you make a list of all the people you could talk to, reach out, and then just ask them questions like:  “What’s tedious or annoying about your work?”</p>

<p>However, in practice it’s usually a lot more difficult than that. Proper <a href="https://nathanbarry.com/finding-ideas-project/">idea extraction</a> is a skill and an art. <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">Whole books</a> have been written about how to do it right. The main problem is that if you ask the wrong kind of questions, the answers you’re getting will either be not very helpful or even lead you astray.</p>

<p>For example, when someone tells you about a problem it’s essential to ask them: “What have you already tried to solve it?” If the answer is: “Nothing.” the problem is not painful enough. Your solution would merely be “nice to have”. A hallmark of good product ideas is that the problem is currently solved through awkward workarounds.</p>

<p>A cautionary tale that exemplifies how difficult it is to learn something by talking to people is what happened to anthropologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead">Margaret Mead</a>. She lived with the villagers in Samoa, and tried to learn everything she could about the life of teenagers there by talking to them. Years later other scientists discovered that most of her findings were based on stories that were completely made up by her teenage subjects. The teenagers admitted that they had made up stories just for fun.</p>

<p>Hence, instead of talking to individual people it can make a lot of sense to observe what happens within a whole industry. In that case, we’re talking again about top-down ideation.</p>

<h2 id="inorganic-top-down-ideation">Inorganic, top-down ideation</h2>

<p>The key idea is, as with, organic, top-down ideation, to start with a specific industry in mind. But instead of immersing yourself in it, you observe it from the outside like a scientist.</p>

<p>The first task is to find out where the people in your industry hang out (“<a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/cant-find-audience/">watering holes</a>”). This could be, for example, online forums, Slack channels, Subreddit, or Facebook groups. Once you’ve discovered these places, you go there and start observing what is happening. You’ll have to learn the …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[CSS Layout – Grid vs. Flexbox]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>A good layout makes users stay on a site because it makes important stuff easily accessible and intuitive to find. A lousy layout frustrates users, who leave because they can’t find what they are looking for.</p>
<div><p>In web design, <em>a layout</em> is a term that explains how a website is displayed on the screen. HTML 5 has quite a few elements that define parts of a web page: <em>header, nav, section, aside, article</em>, and <em>footer</em> are the significant distinctions in creating a layout. They constitute the four major sections of a webpage - <em>header/banner, navigation, content</em>, and <em>footer</em>.</p><p>Programming languages make websites feel alive, but at the core of every web page stands the good old HTML. When we discuss layouts, we must consider factors that make <em>a good</em> layout: responsiveness, viewing ports, display devices, browsers, and users’ screen sizes. A great layout not only looks great but can preserve the original intent by fitting in every possible display ratio. This correction is produced through CSS. In this article, we will examine two powerful properties: <em>CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid</em>.</p></div>

<h2>WHAT IS CSS FLEXBOX LAYOUT?</h2>
<div><p>The Flexible Box Module, commonly shortened to ‘flexbox,’ is a one-dimensional layout model. This means it deals with either row or column at a time but never both together. Flexbox is efficient when in aligning, distributing, and directing elements in a page.</p><p>Two key terminologies in Flexbox are the <strong>main axis</strong> and the <strong>cross axis</strong>. A flex container's main axis is the primary axis along which these flex items are laid out, and the cross-axis is perpendicular to it.</p><p>To start, we will wrap our HTML <em>divs</em> in a <em>flex-wrapper</em>.&nbsp;</p></div>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="flex-wrapper"&gt;
  &lt;div id="one"&gt;Header&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="two"&gt;Nav&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="three"&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;  
  &lt;div id="four"&gt;Footer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In CSS, our parent container, "flex-wrapper" will be converted to a flexbox with a simple line of code. </p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper { 
  display: flex; 
} 
</code></pre>
<p>I'll be adding a few elements and properties with bright colors and margins to make our <i>containers</i> and <i>divs</i> stand out.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  background-color: beige; 
} 
.flex-wrapper &gt; div { 
  background-color: green; 
  height: 100px; 
  width: 100px; 
  margin: 10px; 
} 
</code></pre>
<p>You can see how nicely the div elements position itself horizontally. But if you notice, it doesn’t entirely take up all the space within the container. There’s a gap at the end. We can change this by adding <b>flex-grow</b>.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper &gt; div { 
  flex-grow: 1; 
}</code></pre>
<p>The flex-grow element distributes each item in a flex container. The default is 0, and by assigning a unit number to any of the <em>divs</em>, you can make it grow more massive than the rest. The opposite of this is <b>flex-shrink</b>.</p>
<pre><code>#one{ 
  flex-grow: 10;
} 
/* this gives the first div ten more units than the others */
</code></pre>
<h3>Flex-direction</h3>
<p>Flex-direction controls the direction in which items in a flex container should face. You can make the <em>divs</em> go up, down, left, and right. You can also have them in reverse order. By default, items in a flex-container are ordered from left to right, horizontally, within the main axis.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: row; /* default direction */ 
}
.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: row-reverse;  
}</code></pre>
<p>Here, the items are displayed from left to right, but in reverse order. The fourth <em>div</em> now becomes the first and the first — the last.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: column; 
} 
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>divs</em> are ordered from in a vertical manner - from up to down.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: column-reverse; 
}</code></pre>
<p>The <em>divs</em> are ordered vertically, but in reverse, where the fourth <em>div</em> is at the top, and the first one is at the bottom.</p>
<h3>Flex Basis</h3>
<p>Flex basis defines the size of an item or a div inside the flex-container. This size value can be in <em>em, px,</em> or <em>percentage</em>. Flex-basis is different from flex-grow because it doesn’t equally share the space between items in a container.</p>
<pre><code>#three { 
  flex-basis: 200px; 
}</code></pre>
<h3>Flex</h3>
<p>Flex is a shorthand property that combines flex-shrink, flex-grow and flex-basis. It is recommended that you use this property instead of writing each individual property and its value. The order to set the values for the property is this: flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper { 
  display: flex; 
  flex: 0 0 200px; 
} 
</code></pre>
<h3>Justify-content and align-self</h3>
<p>Justify-content and align-self is the perfect solution to centralize a <em>div</em> or a container on a browser using flexbox.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper { 
  display: flex; 
  flex: 0 0 200px; 
  justify-content: center; 
  align-items: center; 
} 
</code></pre>
<h2>CSS Layout GRID</h2>
<p>CSS grid is a powerful 2-dimensional layout. This means <b>it can handle both the rows and columns of the layout</b>. CSS grid works with a 12-grid arrangement, where the screen is (invisibly) divided into 12 parts, and items must fit into this arrangement.<br <br=""><b>CSS grid's advantage over flexbox and other layout models is its two-dimensional quality</b>. It also makes positioning more straightforward, and the container’s elements can be set to overlap and overlap each other.</p>
<h3>Defining a grid in CSS grid</h3>
<p>A simple CSS line will transform an HTML structure to a CSS grid.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt; 
  &lt;div id="one"&gt;Header&lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div id="two"&gt;Nav&lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div id="three"&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;  
  &lt;div id="four"&gt;Aside&lt;/div&gt;   
  &lt;div id="five"&gt;Section&lt;/div&gt;  
  &lt;div id="six"&gt;Footer&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
</code></pre>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
} 
</code></pre>
<h3>Grid template-columns and grid-template-rows</h3>
<p>The grid-template-columns and grid-template-row define the size of a column or row. It assigns a <i>div</i> a size depending on what is assigned. When you set the size of a template-column and template-grid size, you use <i>px, fr, percentage, or em</i>.</p>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns:  40px 1fr 20%;  
  grid-template-rows: 200px; 
  background-color: beige;   
}
.container &gt; div { 
  background-color: green; 
  margin: 10px; 
} 
</code></pre>
<div><p><b>grid-template-columns:</b> 40px 1fr 20%; - this line of code tells the browser to assign the first div a width of 40px. The second takes one fraction of the assigned space and the third 20%. Automatically, <em>divs</em> 4 to 6 move below the first 3, and takes on the values assigned in the same order. This means <em>div</em> 4 is assigned 40px, <em>div</em> 5 one fraction and <em>div</em> 6, 20%.</p><p>To place all six <em>divs</em> on one line, we must assign six values to the grid-template-column. We do not have to give different measurements to the grid-columns. We could use only <em>percentages, fr,</em> or <em>px</em>.</p><p>
<b>grid-template-rows:</b> 200px; - this assigns all the divs a height of 200px;</p></div>
<h3>FR</h3>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: 16.7% 16.7% 16.7% 16.7% 16.7% 16.7%;  
} 
</code></pre>
<div><p>By assigning 16.7% in 6 places, I have successfully divided the six divs in the container into six equal parts on the screen. I used 16.7 because 16.7 times 6 gives 100% of the screen width.</p><p>Using percentage and px works perfectly, but it lacks adequate flexibility and belies the most useful resource - <b>a fraction of the CSS grid</b>.</p><p><b>Fr</b> is a fractional unit. It assigns each item one fraction of available space. The fractional space can be increased to accommodate each div according to how much space they need.</p><p>Our grid-template-columns now becomes</p></div>
<pre><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; 
</code></pre>
<p>This divides each div equally on the screen.</p>
<pre><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr 2fr 1fr 1fr; 
</code></pre>
<p>This new value makes the second and fourth div twice the size of the rest. Most importantly, it is still distributed evenly on the browser and very much responsive.</p>
<h3>Repeat Function</h3>
<p>Rather than write down the values repeatedly, we can take advantage of the repeat function to assign values once.</p>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
}</code></pre>
<p>The syntax is relatively straightforward. We need to use the word ‘repeat’ and then assign how many times we want the size repeated, which is 6, and then give the measurement value. This repeat function works with <em>fr, em, px</em> as well as <em>percentage</em>. This works for template-row as well.</p>
<h3>Gap</h3>
<p>Gap, also called <em>gutter</em> is a CSS grid property that allows you to specify the gap-space between <em>divs</em> in a CSS grid container. It works just like the margin property and is calculated mainly in <em>px</em>.</p>
<pre><code>gap: 10px;</code></pre>
<h3>Grid-column-start/grid-column-end and grid-row-start/grid-row-end</h3>
<p>The grid-column-start and grid-column-end place a grid item in a particular location within the column by referring to specific grid lines. The grid-row-start and grid-row-end also do the same to the row. By assigning a value to this property, grid items can be conveniently manipulated to start and end within the specified areas.</p>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: repeat (3, 1fr); 
  grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 200px); 
}
#one { 
  grid-column-start: 1; 
  grid-column-end: 3; 
  grid-row-start: 1; 
  grid-row-end: 4; 
}</code></pre>
<div><p>When you assign these values to the first div, you’ll notice it pushes the second div one unit away, and it occupies the first two positions, pushing div 3 below. Row-wise, it now occupies three positions giving it a longer height.</p><p>There is a rule when indexing in programming because we generally count from 0, which applies here. The last value is usually mentioned, but not put into effect. For example, the grid-column-end is 3, but it stops at 2 just like the grid-row-end, which ends at 3 and not 4.</p></div>
<h3>Grid-columns and grid-row</h3>
<p>Gap, also called <em>gutter</em> is a CSS grid property that allows you to specify the gap-space between <em>divs</em> in a CSS grid container. It works just like the margin property and is calculated mainly in <em>px</em>.</p>
<pre><code>#one { 
  grid-column: 1/3; 
  grid-row: 1/4; 
}</code></pre>
<h3>Creating galleries using CSS grid</h3>
<p>CSS grid is the perfect model to create galleries. With little code and manipulation, you could make perfect, responsive gallery layouts.</p>
<h4>A Mosaic Gallery Layout</h4>
<p>A mosaic gallery layout creates even tiles of images distributed evenly over a page/container.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt; 
  &lt;div id="one"&gt;Image One&lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div id="two"&gt;Image Two&lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div…</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
			
<div><p>Ever fallen down the ‘apples and pears’? Have you had your ‘barnet’ chopped recently? Called a mate on the old ‘dog and bone’? Or, ‘aven’t you a scooby’ about what all of that means?</p><p>Sit back, grab a nice cuppa ‘Rosy Lee’, and all will be explained.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>These phrases belong to the vernacular of Cockney rhyming slang, a code-like way of speaking that originated in mid-19th century East London. You may remember your grandparents speaking it growing up, or perhaps you’ve heard a phrase or two being thrown about as you walk down <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/roman-road-market-history/">Roman Road Market</a>, hunting for a bargain.</p>



<div><p>Leanne, who works in <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/g-kelly-pie-mash-shop-working-class-food/">G Kelly</a>, said that hearing rhyming slang in the East End ‘isn’t as common these days’. ‘Pie and liquor is the Cockney rhyming slang for vicar’, she smilingly told us as she ladled the legendary parsley sauce. </p><p>Despite being less popular today, its old prevalence can still be heard, or seen, on our local streets. ‘<a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/bottlejob-craft-off-licence-shop-opens-globe-road/">BottleJob</a>‘, the bottle shop and craft off-licence in Globe Town, takes its name from a Cockney rhyming slang expression used to mean ‘coward’, which owner Alex Dehayen recalls as his grandfather’s affectionate nickname for him.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Due to its largely spoken nature, there are very few written records of its roots, but it was supposedly the language of stallholders and criminals. Thieves and vagabonds could use this type of ‘cryptolect’, a secretive language, to keep their liaisons well kept from eavesdropping authorities. A type of ‘in-the-know’ jargon, aiming to exclude or mislead anyone from outside of the Cockney bubble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A sense of pride and nostalgia transpired from our Facebook call out about Cockney rhyming slang memories, particularly from the children that can remember their parents and grandparents using it. Mary Demmel remembers her aunt Mag leaving her house to get the bus saying “let me get me ole grey mare out”, meaning ‘fare’. Carol Legg’s nan ‘used to talk of the Artful that lived up the road’, referring to the lodger (Artful Dodger).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pete Bailey, who comes from Hackney, recalled, ‘Growing up on the market, I used to hear everyone speaking it. Now it’s just a rare thing. I was at a football match last season and was standing with our captain’s girlfriend. She was shivering so I handed her my scarf and said, “Get that round your Gregory”. She looked at me funny and said, “What are you talking about?”. I’m trying to keep the Cockney language alive by teaching my godchildren.’</p>



<p>More commonly used today to describe a working class London accent, the term ‘Cockney’ actually has a specific geographical radius. It is officially defined as someone born within earshot of the chiming bells of Cheapside’s St Mary-le-Bow Church.</p>



<div><p>So, how exactly does this old-school lingo work? And, how on earth does a word like ‘plates’ come to mean ‘feet’? In its simplest form, a common word (feet) is typically replaced by a rhyming phrase of two or three words (plates of meat). The most proficient Cockney would usually shorten this back down to one word (plates). And, there you have it. Suddenly the expression ‘me plates are killing me’ translates as ‘my feet hurt’.</p><p>Don’t be fooled by the off-the-tongue ease at which it is most authentically delivered. These sayings can get confusingly cryptic. ‘Double slang’ is even harder to unscramble; this is how the name of a Greek philosopher came to mean one’s derrière. Aris is short for Aristotle. Aristotle rhymes with bottle. Bottle and glass rhymes with…you might want to have a go at working that one out yourself.</p></div>



<p>Marian Peck commented on our Facebook call out explaining her recollections of ‘backslang’. She said, ‘<strong>I</strong> think there were a couple of versions, but the one Cyril used was to take off the first letter of the word and put an ‘a’ on the end. So cat would be ‘ata’, television would be ‘elevisiona’.He came from Poplar, but worked as a bell boy in a London Hotel in the 1920s. Apparently a lot of staff could speak it and so the guests would not know what they were saying if they wanted to have a private conversation. My sister had go at it and tried to teach me, but I never had the patience!’</p>



<p>Some terms were born out of the summers that Cockneys spent hop picking. Whole families from the poorer parts of London would migrate ‘down to Kent’ to work on the fields, providing the surge of manual labour needed at harvest time. ‘Cherry’ is slang for ‘dog’, relating to the ‘cherry hog’ container that was used to collect crops. East Ender, Kim West, recalls, ‘I remember as a child in the hop fields, the adults would use slang and us kids would pick it up. The farmer would not understand a word’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other older examples relate to London locations. ‘Peckham Rye’ meaning ‘tie’, ‘Hampstead Heath’ meaning ‘teeth’ and ‘Tilbury Docks’ meaning ‘socks’. An all time favourite, first recorded in the 1850s, has to be ‘Barnet (fair)’, relating to one’s hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century, celebrity names began to influence these linguistic inventions. Musician Hank Marvin’ came to mean ‘starving’, singer Ruby Murray morphed into a synonym for ‘curry’, and racing driver Ayrton Senna was the new way of saying ‘tenner’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the 2012 Olympics, an ATM on Commercial Street gave customers the language option of ‘Cockney rhyming slang’. To withdraw a bit of ’sausage and mash’ (cash), you were first asked to enter your ‘Huckleberry Finn’ (pin). This led to monetary prompts such as ‘Lady Godiva’ (£5) and ‘Horn of Plenty’ (£20).&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>In 1987, Mile End born record producer Paul Oakenfold coined the slang phrase ‘It’s all gone Pete Tong’, meaning ‘a bit wrong’. He wrote it in an article about acid house called ‘Bermondsey Goes Balearic’ for ‘Boy’s Own’ fanzine. Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong adopted it as the name for his Ibiza club night set and his nightly radio programme in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether from Del Boy or Danny Dyer, you have probably heard a bit of Cockney rhyming slang when watching the custard (telly – from ‘custard and jelly’). Some phrases even made it to DisneyLand via the lamplighters and chimney sweepers of ‘Mary Poppins’.</p></div>



<p>From <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/knees-up-mother-brown-song-history/">old cockney classics</a>, like ‘My Old Man’s a Dustman’, to the lyrics of The Kinks and The Streets, you may have heard some rhyming slang sing from your record player or through your speakers.</p>



<p>Although it comes from the East End, the use of Cockney rhyming slang spreads far beyond the Bow Bells. The East Midlands accent has substituted ‘Derby Road’ for ‘cold’ and, down under, the name of Australian businessman Reg Grundy created ‘grundies’ (an Aussie word for ‘undies’).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite their travels, these phrases are undoubtedly heard most satisfyingly from the buoyant vocal box of a true, old-school, Cockney. In fact, some terms won’t make sense in any other accent. ‘Joanna’ means piano, relying on the ‘piannah’ pronunciation.&nbsp; Bawdy, bolshy and cheeky, the organically East End intonations perfectly capture the lingo’s playful charm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is the tradition dying out? A study carried out by the Museum of London in 2012 surveyed 2000 people, half of them Londoners, about their understanding and use of Cockney rhyming slang. It emerged that just 8% used the terms in everyday speech. The changing face of society, with new multi-cultural influences and the rise of virtual communication, is more aptly reflected in the contemporary slang of today’s youth.</p>



<p>However, that’s not to say that Cockney rhyming slang is a distant memory. New references to popular culture have been updating the canon since Victoria sat on the throne.&nbsp; The famous cartoon dog ‘Scooby Doo’ even managed to make the cut when ‘not a scooby’ came to mean ‘not a clue’.</p>



<div><p>Some phrases have become obsolete, but some are here to stay. Just as Shakespeare’s plays gave us terms like ‘a laughing stock’ and ‘a pound of flesh’, the old rhymes of East End folk have seeped right into the heart of the English Language. So, despite change and time, maybe it’ll never really be ‘brown bread’.</p><p>To find out more about Cockney rhyming slang, you can watch this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=299871854075637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">archive footage</a> about how it was used.</p></div>

<p>Bluetooth Audio is generally considered convenient, but not ‘audiophile’. Any self respecting audiophile is probably connecting their fancy headphones to some Digital to Analog Converter/Amp combo which might be connected to their computer using some fancy gold plated USB Cable. More power to them, I am not self respecting. I made a decision a few months ago to switch entirely to Bluetooth Audio as the convenience and tidiness of having a wireless headset just appealed to me so much.</p>
<p>I purchased the M-Pow H21s - which are a fairly budget noise cancelling pair of Bluetooth headphones. They appealed to me because they weren’t enormously expensive, and other M-Pow stuff I’d purchased in the past was of good enough quality for me to trust these would be too. I wasn’t wrong. The noise cancelling is reasonably good, and the sound profile, while not ‘neutral’ - is totally fine for me to use while working.</p>
<p>One thing that really did annoy me about these headphones (and I’m not sure if the fault lies with Bluetooth Audio on Linux or with the headphones themselves) is that if I walked away from my desk and then returned, the audio quality would perceptibly drop, but never quite recover. It seemed to get ‘stuck’ at a lower quality, until the headset was rebooted. One day, I got tired of this, so decided to research what was going on.</p>

<p>In the beginning, there was A2DP - or the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile. This is a Bluetooth profile - which describes a method by which audio can be transmitted between a sender and a receiver. The profile mandates that all Bluetooth devices support a codec called SBC - or Low Complexity Subband Codec. A codec defines exactly how the device that is sending the audio should compress it. SBC is what’s known as a Low Complexity codec. Low Complexity codecs have the design goal of being easy to encode for the sender and being easy to decode for the receiver. It’s a fairly old codec, being the precursor to MP2 - itself the precursor of MP3. When consumers started demanding better quality audio out of their Bluetooth hardware, various other codecs were added to hardware. Some hardware added MP3 encoding and decoding - which was a small improvement in two ways. Firstly, if the source material was already MP3, and the encoder was smart enough, the MP3 data could directly be sent to the receiver, meaning that no encoding step was necessary. Secondly, MP3 is generally considered to be a better codec in terms of the resulting audio quality, so even if there was an encoding step, the results were generally better. Apple added AAC support to their hardware - which itself is a far superior codec to MP3 lends much the same benefits. The freshest codec which seems to be available is from a company that Qualcomm gobbled up - aptX. This codec is interesting in the sense that it only offers the second advantage talked about above. Nobody has music in aptX format, which meant that all source material must be re-encoded on the device sending the audio.</p>

<p>The first step to identifying if improvements can be made to your own Bluetooth Audio is to figure out which codecs your Bluetooth Headset supports. You can generally find this out by finding the manufacturers information. My particular headset, the h21 - is dumb as rocks, and only supports SBC. If your headset supports a better codec, especially if it supports a codec called LDAC - you should very much consider trying that before trying to do what we’ll be doing in this article, which is improving the quality available to us using the SBC codec. <a href="https://www.nextpit.com/bluetooth-audio-codecs">This article does a reasonably good job of covering all the codecs.</a></p>
<p>No matter what your headphones support, the next thing you’re going to want to do is install a custom PulseAudio module which both enables support for a bunch of more fancy codecs, and also allows you to configure the codecs. Go grab <a href="https://github.com/EHfive/pulseaudio-modules-bt/wiki/Packages">EHfive/pulseaudio-modules-bt</a> and restart PulseAudio. You should already see in your systems sound settings you can now actually select between AAC, APTX, APTX HD, and LDAC - if your headset supports it. You can probably stop here if you’re able to switch to APTX or LDAC. If not, it’s time to configure SBC to be less sucky.</p>

<h4>default.pa, with the changes</h4>

</figure>
<p>So, a quick review of the options the SBC encoder has that we likely care about. Firstly, the Stereo mode. Generally in audio the two stereo modes we have are.. well Stereo and Joint Stereo. Stereo transmits two distinct channels of audio in the same stream, but completely distinct from one another. Joint stereo makes the assumption that the left and right channels are probably similar enough that just encoding how the right channel differs from the left will result in a more efficient packing of data. Your headset is likely already using one of these two modes. SBC actually supports a third mode, called dual - which essentially sends two audio streams to your headset, completely independently of one another. This effectively doubles the bit-rate your headset can operate at, since you now will have two separate streams of audio being encoded, rather than just one. If your headset supports this dual mode, and it most likely does, you definitely want it. In fact, this unofficial feature has been added to a popular custom Android OS - called LineageOS, <a href="https://www.lineageos.org/engineering/Bluetooth-SBC-XQ/">and they describe the benefit of this very well here</a>.</p>
<p>The next option we likely care about is the bitpool. The bitpool effectively determines the bitrate the audio will be encoded at. The higher, the better. <a href="https://btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-bitrate-calculator/">A calculator is available here</a> but what is shows is that at the default highest available Bitpool value (53) in Joint Stereo mode - the maximum available bitrate is 328kbps. If we do nothing else, and just switch to Dual Channel mode - the bitrate predictably roughly doubles to 617.4kbps. Some headsets, like my H21s, actually seem to do fine at higher bitpool values. Through experimentation, I found that around 70 was as much as my headset could manage without hearing the audio equivalent of a buffer overflow. At a bitpool value of 70, in dual channel mode, the bitrate now gets to 804.8kbps!</p>
<p>If you are experimenting with a different headset, I suggest starting with a bitpool value of 53 and dual stereo enabled. You can then experiment with increasing the bitpool value, as described below.</p>
<p>To modify these values, you’ll need to edit <code>/etc/pulse/default.pa</code>. Firstly, find the lind that begins <code>load-module module-bluetooth-discover</code>. Modify it to add these flags, like so:</p>
<p><code>load-module module-bluetooth-discover a2dp_config="sbc_cmode=dual sbc_min_bp=53 sbc_min_bp=53 sbc_freq=44k"</code></p>
<p>This will lock your SBC encoder to work at a bitpool size of 53 - in dual stereo mode. Restart PulseAudio by doing <code>pulseaudio -k</code> - and reconnect your Bluetooth headset. Hopefully, you’ll perceive a large improvement in quality, as I did. You can now experiment by changing that value of 53 for a higher value. <a href="https://btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/codec-compatibility/">There’s a list of known compatibility available here</a>.</p>
<p>The one downside of this approach of locking the encoder to work at a particular bitpool is that you lose graceful degredation of quality as the link quality reduces. You could experiment with having a lower value for the <code>sbc_min_bp</code> so that the encoder can reduce quality.</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps you!</p>

October 13, 2020 | https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-10-13-sending-webmentions-from-a-static-website | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-10-13-sending-webmentions-from-a-static-website">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>A few months back I wrote about <a href="https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-06-27-indieweb-ifying-my-personal-website">indieweb-ifying this website</a>. I attempted to follow the excellent <a href="https://indiewebify.me/">indiewebify.me guide</a>, but I skipped step 2 of Level 2, i.e. <a href="https://indiewebify.me/#send-webmentions">adding the ability to send Webmentions to other IndieWeb sites</a>. My <a href="https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-06-27-indieweb-ifying-my-personal-website#publishing-on-the-indieweb">excuse</a> at the time was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I decided to skip this step for now given that it's relatively easy to <a href="https://indieweb.org/webmention-implementation-guide#One-liner_webmentions">send a Webmention manually using <code>curl</code></a> and it's not as if I currently blog that frequently!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway a couple of recent discoveries led me to fix this omission…</p>

<h3 id="webmentionapp">webmention.app</h3>

<p>This lovely little <a href="https://webmention.app/">service</a> built by <a href="https://remysharp.com/">Remy Sharp</a>, not to be confused with <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> which is used for <em>receiving</em> incoming <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmentions</a>, makes it easy to <em>send</em> outgoing webmentions for all the links on a given page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a platform agnostic service that will check a given URL for links to other sites, discover if they support webmentions, then send a webmention to the target.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately I still have an <a href="http://feeds.jamesmead.org/floehopper-blog">RSS feed</a> for my blog and in this case the documentation <a href="https://webmention.app/docs#using-ifttt-to-trigger-checks">suggests using IFTTT</a> to automate doing this each time you publish an article.</p>

<h3 id="actionsflow">Actionsflow</h3>

<p>Somewhat serendipitously I recently came across <a href="https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/">Actionsflow</a> which is a free Zapier/IFTTT alternative for developers to automate workflows based on GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I was initially quite confused by the Actionsflow documentation and I tried to add my Webmention-sending workflow to <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/jamesmead.org">the repo for this website</a>. However, once I realised the idea was to <a href="https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow-workflow-default/generate">create a new repo</a> based on a template, things became a little clearer.</p>

<h3 id="workflow-to-send-webmentions">Workflow to send Webmentions</h3>

<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/send-webmentions">this repo</a> and added <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/send-webmentions/blob/main/workflows/send-webmentions.yml">this workflow</a> to poll my RSS feed and send an HTTP POST request to the webmention.app API for every new item. I was pleasantly surprised by how simple this was:</p>

<pre><code>name: Send webmentions for new blog posts

<p>It took me a while to realise that the underlying Actionsflow GitHub Action was running every 5 minutes and <em>polling</em> my RSS feed. It seems to use the GitHub Action cache to "remember" which items it has seen before. Since I don't publish blog posts very often, polling every 5 minutes seemed a bit excessive and so I decided to <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/send-webmentions/commit/eb5a9cb573b1c532c92143b7fb2aed260c5fa552">reduce the frequency to hourly</a>.</p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I'm not sure I like the design of Actionsflow which means creating a new repo, but perhaps this would make more sense to me if I had more than one workflow. I suppose this repo is roughly equivalent to a single IFTTT account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the course of the last year I've automated some backup jobs for <a href="https://gofreerange.com/">Go Free Range</a> using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/typescript/api/aws-ecs-patterns/scheduledfargatetask.html#aws_ecs_patterns_ScheduledFargateTask"><code>ScheduledFargateTask</code> class</a> in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">AWS CDK</a> to fire up a container and run a script on a cron schedule. This has worked really well, but it's quite tempting to port these over to Actionsflow so we don't have to maintain anything other than the <code>Dockerfile</code> and associated shell scripts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>webmention.app is really nicely implemented with good documentation; it's a classic example of an elegant solution to a tightly scoped problem. Since I'll be making use of the API on a regular basis, I decided to <a href="https://jamesmead.org/blog/paypal.me/rem">buy Remy a drink</a> to say thank you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I'd also like to find a way to say thank you to <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a> who built webmention.io and <a href="https://snarfed.org/">Ryan Barrett</a>, <a href="https://kylewm.com/">Kyle Mahan</a>, et al who built <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a>.

<div>
<p>One of the esoteric programming languages that a fair number of people have
heard of, is “Whitespace”. I'm sure this has nothing at all to do with jokes
like its source code being so fantastically efficient when being printed out.
The language was actually meant as a joke (at least that's how one of its
creators puts it when he mentions the language in some of his talks). But even
though people are aware of the language's existence, they rarely know how it
works. Let's change that, because it's really not all that hard.</p>

<p>At its core, the language describes operations on a stack machine, that has
access to a heap. The only data type of the machine are integer values of
arbitrary size. There are operations for the machine, that use these values to
encode characters as well. And that's about it. The rest is just a peculiar way
to encode operations and values using three ASCII whitespace characters (<code>TAB</code>,
<code>SPACE</code> and <code>LINEFEED</code>).</p>

<p>Operations are grouped by function. These groups determine an operation's
encoding prefix, that the language spec calls “Instruction Modification
Parameter”. Many of the operations have no arguments, as they create and
consume arguments on the machine's stack. Some however do take an argument:
Integers and Labels. Label arguments are used by flow control operations; and
integer arguments are used by some of the stack manipulation operations.</p>

<p><img src="http://bewatermyfriend.org/media/op-arith-div.png" alt="Arithmetic Operation: Integer Division" id="arithmeticoperation:integerdivision"></p>

<p>Their encoding is similar: Both use strings of spaces and tabs, that are
terminated by linefeeds. In labels, the spaces and tabs have no special
semantics. At least not within the language specification; more on that later.
In integers, tabs encode ones and spaces encode zeroes. Something to note about
such integer literals is that they do not use two's complement to encode
negative numbers. Instead, they use the literal's leftmost bit as a signedness
bit: Tab means negative number, space means positive number. That makes
encoding arbitrarily wide integers straight-forward.</p>

<p><img src="http://bewatermyfriend.org/media/ws-numbers.png" alt="Integer Literals" id="integerliterals"></p>

<p>When you take a look at actual whitespace programs, you'll sometimes notice
extremely long labels. Oftentimes with that, there seems to be a silent
convention to use chunks of eight characters to encode eight bits (same
semantics as in number literals as to what characters encode ones and zeroes)
that are turned into a positive number, which is then mapped to the ASCII
encoding (seven would have sufficed, but that's not what the programs I've seen
use).</p>

<p>When you try and implement this language, you'll notice a couple of things your
machine implementation needs: A stack obviously, since whitespace is a
stack-manipulating language. Another stack, used as a callstack, since the
language has <code>Call</code> and <code>Return</code> operations. It also needs a heap, mapping
addresses to integers. Finally you'll need program memory and a program counter
register. You might want a jump-table too, to deal with translating labels to
addresses. That's not strictly required, though: You could just translate all
labels to addresses before loading the program into your machine.</p>

<p>When I digged deep enough into the language spec to figure this out, I was
intrigued enough to actually do yet another implementation of the language.
It's called <code>SpaceMan</code> and it is available at
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ft/spaceman">gitlab.com/ft/spaceman</a> as well as
<a href="https://github.com/ft/spaceman">github.com/ft/spaceman</a>.</p>

<p>I've added an <a href="https://gitlab.com/ft/spaceman/-/blob/master/doc/whitespace.org">org-mode conversion of the original language
homepage</a>,
because that one is currently only available via archive.org. When trying some
of the more complex examples you can find on the net, I was running into
problems. My implementation failed to even parse them. I was verifying my code
for quite some time, until I concluded that it was implementing the parser
correctly. So I looked at other implementations. And it turned out most of them
implemented two additional stack-manipulating operations: <code>Copy</code> and <code>Slide</code>.
Apparently, they were added to a later specification of the language. I
couldn't find such a spec on the net, though (not that I invested a lot of time
— see the update at the end of the post for a resolution to this). However,
after implementing these two, spaceman could run the most elaborate examples
that I could find online, like a sudoku solver. I've added those two additional
operations to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ft/spaceman/-/blob/master/doc/whitespace.org">included version of the language
spec</a>.</p>

<p>I'm using Megaparsec for parsing purposes. And with a couple of utilities put
in place, writing the parser becomes rather pleasant:</p>

<div><pre>stackParser <span>::</span> Parser StackOperation
stackParser <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>(</span>      <span>try</span> <span>$</span> imp <span>[</span> space <span>])</span>
  <span>(</span>      <span>try</span> <span>$</span> Push  <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> number <span>[</span> space <span>])</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>|<span>&gt; (</span><span>try</span> <span>$</span> operation        <span>[</span> linefeed<span>,</span> space    <span>]</span> Duplicate<span>)</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>|<span>&gt; (</span><span>try</span> <span>$</span> operation        <span>[</span> linefeed<span>,</span> tabular  <span>]</span> Swap<span>)</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>|<span>&gt; (</span><span>try</span> <span>$</span> operation        <span>[</span> linefeed<span>,</span> linefeed <span>]</span> Drop<span>)</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>|<span>&gt; (</span><span>try</span> <span>$</span> Copy  <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> number <span>[</span> tabular<span>,</span>  space    <span>])</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>|<span>&gt; (</span><span>try</span> <span>$</span> Slide <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> number <span>[</span> tabular<span>,</span>  linefeed <span>])</span>
</pre></div>

<p>When implementing the language's operations, you'll find that you're facing
lots of common instructions that manipulate the virtual machine. You put those
common tasks into functions, of course, and like any designer of an assembly
language worth their salt, you obviously give your instructions slightly
cryptic three letter names. With those, implementing the stack-manipulating
operations looks like this:</p>

<div><pre>eval <span>::</span> WhitespaceMachine <span>-&gt;</span> StackOperation <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> WhitespaceMachine
eval m <span>(</span>Push n<span>)  =</span> <span>return</span> <span>$</span> pci <span>$</span> psh <span>[</span>n<span>]</span> m
eval m Duplicate <span>=</span> <span>return</span> <span>$</span> pci <span>$</span> psh h m               <span>where</span> h     <span>=</span> peek <span>1</span> m
eval m Swap      <span>=</span> <span>return</span> <span>$</span> pci <span>$</span> psh <span>[</span>b<span>,</span>a<span>] $</span> drp <span>2</span> m   <span>where</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span>b<span>] =</span> peek <span>2</span> m
eval m Drop      <span>=</span> <span>return</span> <span>$</span> pci <span>$</span> drp <span>1</span> m
eval m <span>(</span>Copy i<span>)  =</span> <span>return</span> <span>$</span> pci <span>$</span> psh <span>[</span>n<span>]</span> m             <span>where</span> n <span>=</span> ref  i m
eval m <span>(</span>Slide n<span>) =</span> <span>return</span> <span>$</span> pci <span>$</span> psh h <span>$</span> drp <span>(</span>n<span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> m   <span>where</span> h <span>=</span> peek <span>1</span> m
</pre></div>

<p>Implementing the other groups of operations looks similar. I sort of like it.
Each of them would basically fit onto an overhead slide.</p>

<p>As it turns out, editing whitespace programs is tough work. Doing it directly
is best done in an hex-editor. But spaceman has a feature, that makes it dump
the programs syntax-tree to stdout. And those program dumps are actually
executable programs. So if you'd like to edit a whitespace program, you can
dump it into a file, edit its AST and then run that program to yield the
changed whitespace program.</p>

<p>“Yet another whitespace implemention created” achievement unlocked, I guess.</p>

<p><strong>[Update]</strong> Andrew Archibald informs me, that if you spend a little more time
looking for the language specification, that includes <code>Slide</code> and <code>Copy</code>, you
will find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424165140/http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php">http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php (via
archive.org)</a>,
that contains v0.3 of the whitespace specification, that adds these operations.</p>

Eclogiselle is intended to be a compendium of free resources for small communities with paid services available below $5000. In fact, I hope to be able to offer some services for well under a thousand dollars.

</p><p>


I am looking to serve small communities that would have trouble hiring someone at all to do planning and economic development work for them. I am hoping to find creative ways to provide useful resources for communities who often either cannot afford paid staff or cannot find someone willing to work for them for what they can afford to pay.

</p><hr><p>
The small town I live in made an offer to a candidate for their city manager position and the candidate turned them down and took a higher paying job elsewhere. That seems to be par for the course.

</p><p>

Years ago when I was looking to become a professional planner, I haunted the online job listings. A lot of small communities kept the same job openings available for months at a time because of the challenges they face in filling such positions at all.

</p><p>
I have first-hand experience with my local <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CitizenPlanners/comments/duf6ae/main_street_america/">Main Street America</a> program. This is the leading voice for preservation-based economic development and community revitalization across the US. 
</p><p>
It is aimed at revitalizing small towns. In order to be an accredited Main Street program, you need to have an executive director: 

</p><ul><li>0-2500 people = half time volunteer Executive Director</li>

  <li>2500-5000 = half time paid Executive Director</li>

  <li>5000+ = full time paid Executive Director</li></ul><p>

So this well-established program doesn't expect a town of less than 2500 people to be able to pay their economic development director <i>at all</i>. It's a part-time, volunteer position for such communities. It's basically a labor of love. 
</p><p>
For towns between 2500 and 5000 people, they only expect them to be able to pay for a part-time director. It's only for communities above 5000 that they expect you to have a full-time paid executive director for this non-profit economic development entity.

</p><p>
Please note that if they have a full-time executive director, this is probably their only paid employee. There will also be a board running the non-profit and those are all unpaid positions.

</p><p>
So all the evidence suggests that small communities have trouble hiring planning and economic development staff <i>at all</i>, whether it is a city job or a job at a local non-profit trying to fill in the gaps in their small town. And when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/j5a0vr/dark_side_question_typical_services_and_prices_at/">I asked around</a>, the answers I got suggest small communities face additional challenges when they look to contract out services instead of hiring paid staff to serve them.
</p><p>
In one reply to my query, I was given a link to <a href="https://patch.com/new-jersey/triboro/kinnelon-council-members-fear-environmental-resource-e348f325fc">an article</a> from 2012 where The Land Conservancy of New Jersey was offering to do an Environmental Resources Inventory (ERI) for Kinnelon, a burrough in New Jersey. They were offering it at a discount and the price was expected to be $10,000 (back in 2012 -- no doubt, prices have gone up since then).
</p><p>
<a href="https://tlc-nj.org/">The Land Conservancy of New Jersey</a> is apparently a <i>non-profit</i> land trust that has a goal of protecting open space. The person who left the link implied that this is probably a typical fee for non-profits and universities serving this space for small communities.

</p><p>

Non-profits and universities are supposed to be the good guys, the affordable option, the folks doing it out of idealism and not to make a quick buck. But it doesn't take much digging to be suspicious of this $10,000 ERI and why it is being pushed.
</p><p>
In the article, one person objecting to paying for the ERI said, in part, <i>All we do is keep spending money and no ones giving us money.</i> so I pulled up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinnelon,_New_Jersey">Wikipedia page for Kinnelon</a>, New Jersey and, unsurprisingly, this is a wealthy suburb.
</p><p>
According to Wikipedia, in 2012 they were among the top 500 most expensive zip codes in the US. It lists them as at number 462.
</p><p>
A quick search tells me there are nearly 42,000 zip codes in the US. If you pull out a calculator and divide 462 by 42,000, the result is 0.011. So we are talking about people who are just outside of the One Percent. 
</p><p>
I read this article and I see vague, hand-wavy claims that this ERI is "useful for planning efforts" and I also see people complaining about a pattern of being bled for money over the years without getting results. I can readily believe they are being taken advantage of. 

</p><p>
I can believe that people keep going to Kinnelon burrough, selling them services "at a discount" (because "we are the good guys") for thousands of dollars -- because these people can come up with the money -- and the services aren't actually useful for development.
</p><p>
The other thing I was told was that most for-profit, private planning firms do not actively seek out projects that are below about $5k. If you approach them, they might do a small project for you, but chasing it down isn't worth it. It doesn't pay well enough.

</p><p>

Before life got in the way, I wanted to be a professional planner. I've spent years around online planning forums and attending local meetings and what not and I think I would have trouble finding a private planning firm. 
</p><p>
They seem to me to not be very visible. I'm not exactly an insider because I never got the career I wanted, but you would think this would be less opaque to me.
</p><p>

So my impression is that planning firms are hard to identify by small communities, aren't actively seeking business from small communities because it doesn't pay well enough and may not even take a bid from you even if you approach them. If it's only a few thousand dollars, they seem to feel like they are doing you some kind of favor if they are willing to work with you.

</p><p>

I am in Aberdeen, Washington. It is in a region I have dubbed The Pacific Coastal Region of Washington State or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoastalWA/">CoastalWA</a>. 

</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bGDP0jo2muo/X4Tk73UfcOI/AAAAAAAAGyU/ng7YAFlb8jEcNG137qzgwJx-WcKRulB5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/CoastalWA256sq.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="256" data-original-width="256" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bGDP0jo2muo/X4Tk73UfcOI/AAAAAAAAGyU/ng7YAFlb8jEcNG137qzgwJx-WcKRulB5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/CoastalWA256sq.png"></a></p><p>



This is a region with a sparse number of small towns and a large number of unincorporated communities. There is at least a half million people, two or three dozen incorporated small towns and probably upwards of 200 unincorporated communities.

</p><p>
And most likely an influx of people will be coming here in the next few years because it is a relative safe haven from things like climate change. So I think the many small communities in this region need to begin preparing for growth if they don't want a bunch of well-heeled outsiders to come in and run rough-shod over the people who are already here.

</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoastalWA/comments/j4u0by/welcome/">
  Welcome to CoastalWA</a></li><li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoastalWA/comments/izecag/counties_of_coastal_wa/">Counties of CoastalWA</a></li><li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoastalWA/comments/iztsji/coastal_wa_is_a_relative_safe_haven_in_2020/">CoastalWA is A Relative Safehaven</a></li></ul><p>

So I think there is tremendous need for free and low cost economic development and planning resources and services that would work well for small communities. The only question in my mind is if I can figure out how to package up offerings that make sense for both me and them and find a way to connect with the people who need it.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Have you ever wondered why people write their own memory allocators? Are they masochists? Do they think they can write a better memory allocator than the OS? Shouldn’t they just use a garbage collected language instead?</p>

<h2 id="why-bother-with-custom-allocators">Why bother with custom allocators?</h2>

<p>Around 2010 or so when Chipmunk2D was new(ish), it didn’t use any custom allocators. Even temporary data was allocated when needed, tracked, and freed when I was done with it. At the time I was developing it, I was using OS X, and this was more or less fine. I even have some old stress test videos on YouTube with tens of thousands of colliding objects in real time on an old Core 2 Duo laptop. Running the same code on Windows XP wasn’t so great however. Had somebody suggested using a custom allocator, I probably would have turned my nose up at the idea and said something like “That’s dumb, I can do something simpler.” Besides, looking at sampling profiler data on OS X was telling me that memory functions weren’t even 1% of the CPU time after all. Why bother trying to make the allocator more efficient? On the other hand I knew what I had really wanted to do was to try and pack all of my collision data together to make it cache friendly. So what I did was to keep pools of various types of structs. If I needed a collision pair struct, I could just grab one from the pool. If the pool was empty, I’d allocate a few more kilobytes of them in a big block first. I did something similar for contact data, but since it only needed to be kept for a single frame I could release entire blocks of it back to the pools all at once. This solved my Windows performance problem, and the locality made for a very nice performance bump on other platforms too!</p>

<p>The astute reader is probably performing a face palm right now as I’ve just described a slab allocator and a zone allocator. :)</p>

<h3 id="no-need-for-a-better-malloc">No need for a better <code>malloc()</code></h3>

<p>So what does <code>malloc()</code> give us anyway?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to nearly unlimited amounts of virtual memory</li>
  <li>Create or free individual allocations of any size</li>
  <li>Safe, transparent access to allocations from any thread</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all great features, and it would be difficult to implement a reasonably generic replacement. On the other hand, many programs and systems within them have unique memory requirements. For Chipmunk2D’s collision system what I needed was completely different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Memory locality</li>
  <li>Predictable performance</li>
  <li>Simplified memory ownership</li>
</ul>

<p>So while I didn’t know it at the time, I had several reasons to want a custom allocator, and I accidentally implemented several! The last item in particular is interesting to me because it’s completely antithetical to what I used to think custom allocators were all about. I had a model in my head where custom allocators were about performance, and garbage collection to be about simplifying ownership, but it turns out the two are not so mutually exclusive. Using some custom allocator techniques in a garbage collected language can improve performance, and using them in a traditional language can give many of the same benefits as if you had garbage collection.</p>

<h3 id="more-reasons-to-bother-with-custom-allocators">More reasons to bother with custom allocators</h3>

<p>Over the years, I’ve wasted <em>many</em> hours debugging memory issues. With just a hash table and a set of linked lists, you can track the history of all your allocations. That makes it pretty easy to track down use after free errors, double free errors, and memory leaks. Using guard pages around your allocations, you can detect overflows. Techniques like this can be a nice complement to external tools like Valgrind or AddressSanitizer. Between the simplified memory ownership, having tools to help detect errors, and tools to debug issues when they do occur, I can happily say I haven’t spent a lot of time debugging memory issues for years. :)</p>

<h2 id="common-allocators">Common Allocators</h2>

<p>Several of the common allocators you hear people talk about are so simple, you can describe them in a paragraph! (Though I’m going to cheat and use diagrams too.)</p>

<h3 id="1-slab-allocator">1) Slab Allocator</h3>

<p><img src="https://slembcke.github.io/images/SlabAllocator.svg" alt="Slab Allocator Diagram"></p>

<p>The collision pair example from Chipmunk2D is basically a slab allocator. The idea is that your allocator just needs to keep a list of large blocks of memory (slabs) that you have allocated, and break those into little fixed sized blocks of memory for your objects that you store in a linked list of free allocations. The trick is to use the allocations themselves as linked list nodes so you don’t have to waste any extra memory for tracking. Allocating memory becomes as fast as pushing or popping nodes onto a linked list, and you only have to talk to the OS when you run out of space in your existing slabs. Additionally, all of the memory is packed together which helps play nice with the CPU cache. As a bonus, you know for sure that you are packing small, short lived allocations together and minimizing fragmentation of your main memory space.</p>

<p><strong>When to use it:</strong> When you need to keep a pool of short lived allocations that are all the same size.</p>

<h3 id="2-linear-allocator">2) Linear Allocator</h3>

<p><img src="https://slembcke.github.io/images/LinearAllocator.svg" alt="Linear Allocator Diagram"></p>

<p>Linear allocators (sometimes called bump allocators) are one of the simplest and most useful custom allocators. The short version: Given a block of memory, start at the beginning and make allocations one after another. When you are done with all the allocations, free or reuse the block. Generally speaking you also need to deal with alignment, overflow, and out of memory issues, but none of that is particularly complicated. Linear allocators are great when you need scratch memory to build a temporary data structure, or otherwise know that all the data you are allocating has a finite lifespan. This works well when processing a user input event in a GUI, or a frame in a game. Not only does your data end up well packed for the CPU cache, but the actual cost of the allocation is just a tiny bit of arithmetic, and deallocation is basically free! The biggest downside of linear allocators is that you need to know the worst case memory usage up front.</p>

<p><strong>When to use it:</strong> When you need fast temporary memory with a finite lifespan.</p>

<h3 id="3-zone-allocator">3) Zone Allocator</h3>

<p><img src="https://slembcke.github.io/images/ZoneAllocator.svg" alt="Zone Allocator Diagram"></p>

<p>Zone allocators (sometimes called arena allocators) make linear allocators more flexible by relaxing the upfront memory allocation. Instead of a single block of memory, you make a series of linear allocators. Whenever one runs out of space, allocate another block and switch to it. Then all you need to do is keep a list of the blocks you allocate so they can be freed (or returned to a pool) when you are done with the zone.</p>

<p>Zone allocators are pretty simple to extend to be thread safe as well. Instead of a single linear allocator you can make one per thread as needed. Only the list of blocks shared by the zone’s linear allocators needs to be protected by a mutex.</p>

<p><strong>When to use it:</strong> When you need fast temporary memory with a finite lifespan, but don’t know how much you’ll need.</p>

<h3 id="4-buddy-block-allocator">4) Buddy Block Allocator</h3>

<p>The buddy block allocator is the fanciest allocator I’ve personally implemented. It’s pretty generic, and is exactly the sort of thing I thought would be a waste of time all those years ago. On the other hand it’s not particularly complicated, and my own implementation is barely 200 sloc. The basic idea is that you start with a large block of memory that you want to split up, and when you make allocations you recursively break the block into halves until you have the size you need. Since sub-blocks are always broken into pairs (buddies), it’s easy to figure out the location of any given block’s buddy with a little math. When freeing a block, you can easily check if the buddy is free and join them back together into a larger block.</p>

<p>While I can’t succinctly describe the whole algorithm in a paragraph, there are plenty of articles on the internet if you want a clearer picture. Also, keep in mind that while this is a pretty generic algorithm that you really <em>could</em> replace malloc() with, you might want to have a pretty good idea of why you’d want to. Maybe you have some strong latency constraints (audio, graphics, etc), or maybe you are allocating something that isn’t regular memory (ex: Vulkan memory). I’ve only used my implementation in a real-time audio synthesizer, but it would have been fine without it too. It was for a hobby project, and it was fun. :)</p>

<p><strong>When to use it:</strong> When you need a general purpose allocator with predictable performance.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-bother-with-custom-allocators">Why not bother with custom allocators!</h2>

<p>Hopefully I’ve convinced somebody that custom allocators aren’t a terrible idea after all, and given them some terms to search for more information.</p>

<p>Happy allocating! :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
<div>

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>A topic that’s been keeping me busy for a while now is how to ensure zero downtime when working in environments where the client source IP needs to be preserved. Let me elaborate on what the problem statement is exactly.</p>
<p>If you deploy an application on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> using a service type <code>LoadBalancer</code>, the cloud controller manager deploys a L4 load balancer in your respective cloud provider environment and <em>usually</em> allocates a public IP address for it. This allows users to effortlessly expose services to the public internet and common use cases include L7 load balancing solutions such as NGINX or Envoy. So far so good. Now if your application requires to know the real client IP this becomes a problem.
</p>
<p>To understand the difficulty with this scenario, let’s have a look at how traffic routing works within Kubernetes. Each node runs <code>kube-proxy</code> which watches the API server for the addition or removal of service and endpoint objects. Without going into too much detail on user space, iptables and ipvs proxy modes, the basic idea is simple. When <code>kube-proxy</code> sees a new service, it will open up a new (random) port on each node for it. Now, when a client connects to the service IP, the proxy redirects traffic to its own port using some low-level routing logic, selects a backend and will proxy traffic from the client to it.</p>
<p>This works across nodes as the Kubernetes master assigns virutal IPs for services and <code>kube-proxy</code> keeps track of backends across nodes. For more info on this matter, I suggest taking a look at the outstanding official documentation <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies">here</a>.</p>
<p>For the more visiual readers, here’s how this looks when using <code>iptables</code> proxy mode (most common).</p>
<p><img src="https://elsesiy.com/assets/posts/2020-10-12-kube-proxy-iptables.svg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Source: Kubernetes documentation</em></p>
<p>What you just read unfortunately doesn’t preserve the client source IP because <code>kube-proxy</code> replaces the source IP with a cluster internal IP due to the fact that the proxy randomly selects a backend to forward the traffic to. To prevent that, Kubernetes has a feature which explicitly tells <code>kube-proxy</code> to proxy requests only to local endpoints and not to other nodes. It’s as simple as setting the <code>service.spec.externalTrafficPolicy</code> to <code>Local</code> instead of the default <code>Cluster</code>. One thing to note here is that if there are no local endpoints, packets will be dropped. Again, more info on this can be found in the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/">official docs</a>.</p>
<p>Great, now our application is able to retrieve the actual client source IP instead of a cluster internal IP. This all sounds good until you have to think about upgrading your backend pods for the load balancer service, doing worker node ugprades or replacing entire nodepools.</p>
<p>Here’s why…<br>
When a new service is added, the cloud provider’s load balancer backend pools is updated with the node IP and node port selected by <code>kube-proxy</code>. It then periodically checks whether the application is healthy using periodic probing. The healthchecks usually have to fail a certain retry count before the cloud provider decides to remove the ip from the load balancer pool. Now if <code>kube-proxy</code> doesn’t forward traffic to a different node and there’s a delay between the service endpoint removal and the cloud provider backend pool ip romal, we’re blackholing traffic.</p>
<p>Unlike adding a new service endpoint which automatically gets propagated to the cloud load balancer configuration, the removal of an endpoint does not. This could be seen as a design flaw of the cloud controller manager implementation but this is not a trivial problem to solve as the cloud provider has no way of knowing how downstream applications behave when connections are closed.</p>
<p>When presented with the aforementioned problem statement, solutions often propose adding the following two remediation items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure a <code>preStop</code> hook for the backend pods to <code>sleep</code> for a certain period of time</li>
<li>Configure <code>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</code> for the pods to allow gracefully handle open connections before pod shutodwn</li>
</ol>
<p>These are certainly important suggestions but only help in the case of a pod rolling update and only if either duration is at least as long as the cumulative time it takes for the health probes to fail and the backend pool to be updated. Since you might not have thought about this early on, you’re out of luck as changing it will trigger pod restarts.</p>
<p>At the heart of the issue is the fact that the node is registered to the load balancer and not individual pods. What complicates matters is the fact, that the service endpoint is removed regardless of a <code>preStop</code> hook or the <code>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</code>, see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67592">this issue</a> for more context. Due to these circumstances it’s almost inevitable to end in a situation where new connections go nowhere which will cause a service disruption for a few unlucky users of your service (the endpoint is removed from the service while the existing pod on a node gracefully terminates and there may not be a second pod on the same node to serve the request).</p>
<p>Here’s a small diagram depicting the unfortunate situation.</p>
<p><img src="https://elsesiy.com/assets/posts/2020-10-12-LB-dilemma.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So what can you do you’re asking?<br>
Well, until the the Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/1669-graceful-termination-local-external-traffic-policy">KEP-1669</a>) is implemented which will dramatically improve the situation: not much. From what I know, you have to write some custom tooling to safely remove a node from your cloud provider load balancer outside of kubernetes since none of the existing primitives allow for zero downtime deployments.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! It’s unfortunate that I can’t present you with a good solution but feel free to share your thoughts and reach out if you have any questions. Until next time <img title=":wave:" alt=":wave:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<div id="post-body-6021876468798783801">

<p>
In the age of COVID, we are all worried all the time. Am I sick? Did he just breathe on me? Will I kill my parents? I’m not even worried for myself, I say, but am I going to be the asshole that infects everyone? Every decision feels so heavy<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> all of the time. It’s exhausting.
</p>
<p>
A friend told me one day: a group of friends planned a get-together, and everyone got tested in the morning at a nearby center with a turnaround of a couple hours.
</p>
<p>
Brilliant. Testing. How obvious a salve! If I could know with reasonable confidence before and after an event that I was safe, I wouldn’t have to worry so much about killing my friends and parents, and I could do more things and see more humans. 
</p>
<p>
But, of course, in my area, I couldn’t find a testing center that would even test me without symptoms, much less give a sub-day turnaround. And, given the timeline of infection, I would really want frequent access to testing to make sure I wasn’t missing the onset of an infection. Alas.
</p>
<p>
I admit I raged against the machine a little— how can we not have better testing infrastructure at this point<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>? Why isn’t every PCR in the country running around the clock? Heck, I ran tests like that all the time in the lab— how hard could it be?
</p>
<p>
“How hard could it be?” — famous last words in tech. But I decided to find out, and it turns out that the answer is… not that hard. It’s actually surprisingly easy to set up, and I now have an at-home COVID testing rig that I have been using to test myself and my family. There are many caveats to that statement, and I will get to those, but, first— let me tell you a little bit more about how I set everything up.
</p>
<h3>What is a PCR, anyway?</h3>


<p>
There are a number of new technologies being developed to make testing for COVID easier, faster, and cheaper<sup id="fnref3"><a target="_blank" href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, but the gold-standard is still a PCR-based test that looks for fragments of RNA from the virus. PCR stands for “polymerase chain reaction,” and it refers to the well-established process by which scientists can make copies of a given piece of DNA: a sample containing the target DNA, special DNA fragments called “primers,” and special enzymes are run through a temperature cycling program that replicates the target DNA sequence, doubling the number of target fragments with each pass through the program.
</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td><img height="413" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uBntKNqjM4N2JygvtofhLXkS0i1bDYqRg0rqiuUj9cE8y3IDyYQHK8j5RtLcGasq2-Bd54U16PK0vuiLbyi4apbmnHQmSrf10tt0uOsVPweazD5yc9sgdFFjsKqnLxMs85P1FAfQ=w640-h413" width="640"></td></tr><tr><td>Through a thermal cycling program, DNA is replicated. The magic of science.&nbsp;<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
PCR is run on a PCR machine. The simplest versions of these are thermal cyclers: there are little holes to put lab-sized plastic tubes in, and the machine runs programmed temperature patterns. These machines are used extensively in labs and clinics to create libraries of DNA fragments being studied for any number of reasons. 
</p>
<p>
A variation on the PCR theme is what’s called a “real-time PCR machine”<sup id="fnref4"><a target="_blank" href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>: a thermal cycler with the ability to measure fluorescence. Instead of just replicating the DNA fragment, a real-time PCR replicates the fragment via its thermal program while also measuring the amount of fluorescent signal created by the process of replicating each fragment in the presence of special fluorescent molecules<sup id="fnref5"><a target="_blank" href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. A real-time PCR machine thus enables scientists to run a process called quantitative PCR, or qPCR, which answers the critical question, “How much of a given DNA fragment exists in this sample?” 
</p>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">The CDC protocol for COVID testing</a> relies on qPCR: collect a sample from the patient, extract the DNA and RNA from the sample, add special DNA fragments called “primers” that match the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, and run qPCR to measure the amount of DNA in the sample that matched the SARS-CoV-2 primers. 
</p>
<p>
So, clearly, the first thing I needed to run an at-home COVID test was a real-time PCR. There are a number of major manufacturers, including <a target="_blank" href="https://lifescience.roche.com/en_us/brands/realtime-pcr-overview.html#qpcr-instruments">Roche</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/category/real-time-pcr-systems?ID=059db09c-88a4-44ad-99f8-78635d8d54db">Bio-Rad</a>, but new top-of-the-line real-time PCR machines cost upwards of $20,000, which is more than I am willing to commit. There are also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?fsb=y&amp;IndexArea=product_en&amp;CatId=&amp;SearchText=real-time+pcr+system">manufacturers in China that sell on Alibaba</a>, but I couldn’t tell which machines would actually be real-time PCRs with software sufficiently in English for me to operate. Plus, after contacting several companies, it seemed they were reticent to ship to the US given regulations anyhow.
</p>
<p>
Which left the resale market. I was skeptical I could find anything given what I assumed would be a worldwide shortfall of PCRs, but I was happy to discover that the market for used real-time PCRs is robust: in addition to dedicated <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biosurplus.com/">used lab supply retailers</a>, there are a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1311&amp;_nkw=real+time+pcr&amp;_sacat=0">wide range of systems available on eBay</a>. I watched the inventory cycle for a while, and soon enough found a good deal on the machine I wanted, the Applied Biosystems StepOne<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. That was the machine I had used in the lab when getting my PhD, so I knew that it had the capabilities I needed and that the software would be ye olde and Windows-only, but usable. 
</p>



<h3>A lab to call my own</h3>


<p>
And so, for $5,000, I became the happy owner of a <strong>real</strong> real-time PCR. COVID-testing aside, real-time PCRs are workhorses of genomics labs, useful for any number of experiments, so I figured if nothing else, I was one step closer to having my own private lab space. But, reading through the CDC protocol, I realized how much standard equipment is assumed in a lab or clinic: freezer, centrifuge, eppies, tube racks, pipettes, ethanol, distilled water, and much more, even before you get to actual reagents (that is, the consumable chemicals).
</p>
<p>
Luckily, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> are here to help. I was quite impressed by how easy it was to quickly stock my lab with everything from pipette tips to saline. The centrifuge and pipettes I bought used; I first tried cheap new pipettes from Alibaba, but they were clearly inaccurate and inconsistent. That left the reagents and consumables. Most, including the expensive enzymes required for qPCR, came from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thermofisher.com/">ThermoFisher</a>, and the rest came from any number of lab supply companies that turn up in Google searches.
</p>
<p>
All in all, I got everything I needed for less than $8,000 (the final supply list is <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-3OBo0eH2512aYwh1O4uRNhoznlhtOHyqC2SRx1Mx1c/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>). Finding a place to put it all was tricky, especially while we’re all in our apartment all the time, but I had one dresser’s worth of space to spare. And so, in our guest bedroom above our linens and next to our assortment of exercise equipment, I now have my very own COVID-testing facility.

<h3>Running an at-home COVID test</h3>


<p>
It takes me about two hours of hands-on time to collect and prep samples, plus an hour to run the PCR and analyze results. I’m intentionally not going to go through the details of the testing protocol itself; I used the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">published CDC protocol</a>, and if you are not familiar enough with RNA extraction and qPCR to follow that protocol, then I can’t be held responsible for what you do. But, at a high level:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Nasal swabbing seems gross, so I collect a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/professionals/flu-specimen-collection-poster.pdf">throat swab</a>. This is the most dangerous part of the process for me as the “clinician”; reaching into the mouth of a potentially infected person is foolhardy. So, I only run the test for people who I am willing to die for<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>, and I have people self-swab for good measure.

</li><li>I use an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/12280050#/12280050">Invitrogen viral extraction kit</a> to lyse cells and collect RNA and DNA.

</li><li>Starting at the cell lysis step, I introduce a SARS-CoV-2 positive control (a fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome as a DNA plasmid) alongside the real human samples.

</li><li>I run reverse transcription (the process of turning RNA, either from the patient or the virus, into DNA) and qPCR in one go with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4444432#/4444432">TaqMan 1-step master mix</a> and each of three primers: two for SARS-CoV-2 genome targets and one negative control (a common human gene, RnaseP). I typically run two replicates per primer per sample to guard against my own imprecision.

</li>
  <li>In theory, qPCR would allow me to run comparative analyses, to determine how much SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in samples relative to the internal controls. However, all I really care about is the binary result, as ANY positive signal for the SARS-CoV-2 would warrant an official clinical test.

</li>
</ol>

<h3>How reliable is testing?</h3>
<p>
I have now run a number of tests for myself and my family. Notably, I have not tested a COVID-positive person so far as I know, so I am not sure yet if any of this works at all. But the internal controls give me some confidence; I figure if I can successfully scrape human RNA off the inside of your throat, but not any viral RNA, chances are you’re not shedding a ton of viral particles in any case.
</p>
<p>
That said— I’m doing this in my house. Barefoot. Even if it were 100% accurate, there would still be a fourish day incubation window to contend with, during which someone could test negative but still be a threat. And I am of course not 100% accurate; even the official clinical tests have an error rate, and can return false positives (that is, return a positive result when the patient is uninfected) or false negatives (that is, return a negative result when the patient is infected). 
</p>
<p>
My lower-bound estimate is that my test is 90% accurate, so I use the 10% chance I am wrong to scale the base risk percentage. For example:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Marla is very conservative about her COVID risk, and for the two weeks prior to testing, she goes to the market twice, with a mask. She has not experienced any symptoms of COVID in relevant memory. We can ball-park Marla’s risk as 0.1% chance she has COVID. If we additionally test her and she comes back negative, there is 10% …</li></ul></div></div></div>

    <p>The following are some of the so called 'Aha!' moments I have experienced
while learning Haskell. I am sharing them here so that it might help someone
spare the hopeless frustration that precedes them.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-idea-of-purely-functional-programming">About the idea of purely functional programming</h3>
<p>For a long time I didn't understand why 'functional programming' was considered better than "regular" imperative programming. So I continued to make programs in the
"regular" imperative fashion. And one day it hit me.</p>
<p>I saw the true nature of what I was doing. I saw how imperative program was
really about arranging a sequence of side effects, the majority of time the
side effect being the mutation of a variable. I saw how an invisible web of
dependencies between statements, that can span, not only spatial but also temporal dimensions, grow
inside my imperative functions with each statement I add to it. I saw how breaking
even one strand of this invisible web, can silently break function behavior and hence the whole program. And I was enlightened...</p>
<p>Enough with the Zen talk. The point is that an imperative programming language, like Python or C, allows the programmer to
create variables. It also allows the programmer refer these variables in the
future and also allows them to change their values during the runtime.</p>
<p>This is very powerful, but with that power (yea, you guessed it), comes a great
responsibility. The responsibility of tracking states of variables while
writing and reading the program. Because each statement that you add to a program depends on a state (state of all variables in scope) that was created by the statements surrounding it.</p>
<p>Purely functional programming takes away this difficult responsibility from the
programmers without taking away the associated powers. It does this by
providing a different set of tools. By this new set of tools, the programmer
can be just as or even more powerful. It takes away variable state changes and
loops and gives us continuation passing, folds, zips, filters and maps. The
enlightenment here is simple. It is that what ever you can express with state
changes and loops in an imperative language can be expressed with this new
vocabulary in a functional style.</p>
<h3 id="about-learning-haskell">About learning Haskell</h3>
<p>People say that Haskell is not complex, and that It is just different.  But I think
that is a useless statement. When the thing you are dealing with is vastly different from what
you are used to, it can appear complex no matter how simple it actually is.</p>
<p>I would say that there are parts of Haskell that are different but straight
forward, and parts that are different and not-so-straight-forward that it
will appear to be hopelessly complex when you are new to it. But bit by bit, topics that you once considered beyond your grasp will turn
approachable. When it happens, it is like unlocking a new level of a video
game; New wonders await. This is why learning Haskell is so much worth the
effort. There is enough depth and breadth to cover to keep you interested long
enough, at the same time being a very good general purpose language with an
excellent community behind it. And now it is even gaining popularity!</p>
<h4 id="about-the-terminology-you-might-encounter-while-learning-haskell">About the terminology you might encounter while learning Haskell</h4>
<p>Following is an excerpt from the script of the movie 'The Good Dinosaur'.</p>
<pre>Daddy T-Rex:
  I need you to keep on the dodge 
  and sidle up the lob lolly past them 
  hornheads , just hootin’ and hollerin’
  to score off them rustlers. We’ll cut dirt 
  and get the bulge on ‘em.
ARLO:
  What?
Son T-Rex:
  He just wants you to get on that rock and scream.
</pre>

<p>Point is, don't be fazed by the unfamiliar terminology.  Most of the time the
whole thing means something a lot simpler than it appears to be.</p>
<h3 id="about-haskell-functions">About Haskell functions</h3>
<p>Haskell functions do not have a statement to return a value to the calling
code. In hindsight, this is pretty obvious, Haskell programs does not have
statements, at all. Instead Haskell functions are expressions that evaluate to
a value, and this value is implicitly the "return" value of that function.
Despite this, you will see people say things like "this function returns x". By
that they just mean that the function evaluate to x. </p>
<h4 id="let-expressions">Let expressions</h4>
<p>If there was one thing that could have single handedly eased my mind as an
imperative programmer coming to functional programming, it is the 'let'
expression.  Because as soon as I found that Haskell functions are limited to
single expression, I am like, "there is only so much you can do with an
expression, how can one do anything useful with it?". My problem was that I was
thinking of expressions in imperative languages. The enlightenment here is that expressions in Haskell can be really elaborate, and Haskell's "let" expression allows you to define any number of intermediate expressions or functions that are required by your final expression. This brings us very close to an imperative style of programming, even though the execution is completely different, as we will see below.</p>
<pre><code>
  sumOfDoubleAndTriple :: Int -&gt; Int
  sumOfDoubleAndTriple x = let
    double = 2 * x
    triple = 3 * x 
  in double + triple
</code></pre>

<p>In the above function, we used the let expression to define two intermediate
results 'double' and 'triple' before adding them both and returning them as the
value of the function.</p>
<p>Note that these are not variable definitions. These bindings cannot change.
You won't be allowed to redefine a symbol within the same let expression. Also
the scope of the bindings are limited to the expression after the 'in' and any
other definitions nested in the same let block. Even though bindings cannot change,
bindings in a syntactically deeper level can shadow bindings coming from
levels above.</p>
<p>One important thing here is that the bindings in a let expressions are not like
assignment statements in an imperative language. They are not 'executed' from
top down. Instead one can think of the execution as starting from the expression after the
'in' clause, and the required values being looked up in the bindings and evaluated as required.</p>
<h3 id="typeclasses">Typeclasses</h3>
<p>There is something very simple about Haskell typeclasses that I took a while to
completely grasp. It is just that Haskell must be able to figure out the
matching instance from the place from which a call to a typeclass function is
made.  If it cannot, then it will be an error.</p>
<p>Without this understanding and keeping this simple thing in mind, you will not
be able to understand a lot of advanced type system features.  For example,
<code>FunctionalDependencies</code> extension. It also helps understanding a lot of
errors that the typechecker ends up throwing at you.</p>
<h3 id="return-type-polymorphism">Return type Polymorphism</h3>
<p>If you ask, this was the biggest enlightenment for me, and one that snapped
a lot things into place. The simple fact, that it is possible for Haskell functions to return
different type of values depending on the type that is required at the call
site. In other words, Haskell functions can be polymorphic in the return type.
The simplest example I can think of is the 'read' function of type <code>String -&gt;
a</code>.  The call to this function in <code>(1::Int) + (read "2")</code> will return an <code>Int</code>
and in <code>(1::Float) + (read "2")</code> will return a Float.</p>
<h3 id="about-io">About IO</h3>
<p>When I was starting with Haskell, I remember trying to take a value wrapped in
IO out of it, purely. After a while, I realized that there is no way to take a
value out of an <code>IO</code> purely, that is, you cannot have a function <code>IO a -&gt; a</code>.
It is not because <code>IO</code> is a Monad and Monads are special cased magic, but
simply because the constructor of <code>IO</code> is not exported out of its module. This
feels so obvious now, but it wasn't once.</p>
<h3 id="wrapper-confusion">Wrapper confusion</h3>
<p>When I was still new to Haskell, I some how ended up with an intution that
types of the form <code>Xyz a</code> have tiny values of <code>a</code> wrapped inside them. And one day
I came across this function of type that looked like <code>(b -&gt; a) -&gt; SomeType a -&gt; SomeType b</code>.</p>
<p>And I am like "W.T.F !? Can GHC reverse engineer functions and make them work in reverse?"
How else can you convert a <code>b</code> wrapped in <code>f</code> to an <code>a</code> when all you have is a function that
can convert from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>?</p>
<p>Well, the SomeType was defined as something like <code>data SomeType a = SomeType (a -&gt; Int)</code>
So the function can be easily defined as something like.</p>
<pre><code>
fn1 :: (b -&gt; a) -&gt; SomeType a -&gt; SomeType b
fn1 bToA (SomeType aToInt) = SomeType (\b -&gt; aToInt $ bToA b) -- SomeType $ aToInt.bToA
</code></pre>

<p>The point is, type of the form <code>Xyz a</code> need not be 'wrappers' or sandwiches or
anything. A type does not tell you nothing about the structure of the data
without it's definition. </p>
<p>Point is, If you have flawed ideas at the a more fundamental level, it will limit your ability to wrap your head around advanced concepts.</p>
<h3 id="the-do-notation">The 'do' notation</h3>
<p>A do block such as,</p>
<pre><code>
do
  a &lt;- expression1
  expression2
  expression3
</code></pre>

<p>DOES NOT desugar to</p>
<pre><code>
  expression1 &gt;&gt;= expression2 &gt;&gt;= expression3
</code></pre>

<p>or to..</p>
<pre><code>
  expression1 &gt;&gt;= (\a -&gt; expression2) &gt;&gt;= (\_ -&gt; expression3)
</code></pre>

<p>but something equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>
  expression1 &gt;&gt;= (\a -&gt; expression2 &gt;&gt;= (\_ -&gt; expression3))
</code></pre>

<p>Even though I was aware of this, I have often caught myself holding the
preceeding two wrong intutions time to time. So I now remember it as desugaring
to 'first expression in block &gt;&gt;= rest of block wrapped in a lambda'</p>
<p>If you recall the signature of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> from the <code>Monad</code> class, it is <code>&gt;&gt;= :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; mb) -&gt; mb</code>
So the arguments to <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> matches with the desugared parts as follows.</p>
<pre><code>
   expression1 &gt;&gt;= (\a -&gt; expression2 &gt;&gt;= (\_ -&gt; expression3))
-- |-- m a --| &gt;&gt;= | --------- (a -&gt; mb) --------------------|
</code></pre>

<p>Another persistent, wrong intuition I had a hard time getting rid of is that it
is the Monad's context that the lambdas in the RHS of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> get as their argument.</p>
<p>But it is not. Instead it is what ever value that came out of the Monad on the
LHS of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, after it was extracted by the code in <em>the Monads
implementation</em>.  It is possible to set up the monad's value in such a way so
as to make the <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> implementation in the monad's instance to do something specific.</p>

                    <p>Breakfast is not the most important meal of the day, but it’s the one most people screw up badly. Over the years, I’ve come to understand what my ideal breakfast should look like:</p><ul><li>Fast to cook and fast to eat. If I spend too much time on stuff that doesn’t matter in the morning, then the whole day gets infected with laziness.</li><li>Light enough to support creative work afterward. I begin writing immediately after I finish eating. And if I devoured a giant omelet with cheese and shrimp, I can’t think clearly.</li><li>Nutritious enough to provide energy until lunch. I don’t want to think about food when I’m working, so the breakfast must power me for at least 3h of deep work before lunch.</li></ul><p>Half a year ago, I stumbled upon oatmeal. For a no-carb fan, it didn’t seem like a big deal at first. But I gave it a shot.</p><p>I’ve tried microwaving oatmeal, boiling it with milk, and even chilling oats overnight. I’ve experimented with berries, fruit, and nuts. I’ve tested ten different types of milk, including oat drink, which is not milk at all.</p><p>I couldn’t resist.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNGnrO3thMY?start=150&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>Oatmeal is like shrimp.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are two best combos I’ve discovered:</p><h2 id="almond-coco-coconut-milk-almonds-raisins">Almond-Coco: coconut milk, almonds, raisins</h2><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/IMG_1441-Copy-1.JPG" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/IMG_1441-Copy-1.JPG 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/IMG_1441-Copy-1.JPG 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/IMG_1441-Copy-1.JPG 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/IMG_1441-Copy-1.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A glass of milk helps to cope with the tongue-burning oatmeal right from the microwave.</figcaption></figure><p>First things first: coconut milk is not <em>really</em> coconut milk. It’s not one of those cheap drinks people sell for a pound or two. The drink is a mix of crushed coconut and some water. This makes it fatty and high in calories, which is perfect for someone who wants their breakfast to be small but nutritious. It also has a natural sweetness because of the coconut itself.</p><p>Coconut milk turns oatmeal into something totally different. Oats become soft and change their structure. The density of the milk also prevents oats from getting dry quickly. This means that you can enjoy “wet” oatmeal for longer and don’t have to bother adding more milk before cooking.</p><p>Also, almonds behave differently if you use coconut milk. They become soft enough so that you don’t have to crack your teeth to bite them. Pro tip: if you’re boiling your oatmeal with milk, add almonds just 2-3 minutes before turning the heat off. This will do the trick.</p><p>Finally, raisins add sweetness and complement the taste of coconut milk nicely. Together, the two provide a sweet but not bitterly sweet taste. Just enough sweet to not add any sugar.</p><h2 id="blue-banana-oat-drink-banana-blueberries-raspberries-walnuts">Blue-Banana: oat drink, banana, blueberries, raspberries, walnuts</h2><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/IMG_2718.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/IMG_2718.jpg 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/IMG_2718.jpg 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/IMG_2718.jpg 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/IMG_2718.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>I buy my berries at Sainsbury's; they always have fresh ones.</figcaption></figure><p>That’s my current favorite one. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Oatly-Original-Drink-Litre-Pack/dp/B0168UVSPG">Oatly Original Oat Drink</a> as a foundation here; that’s something I’ve only been able to find in the UK. It’s a nicely designed drink made from 80% water and 10% rolled oats. I loved it from the first try, and now I drink about 1L every day. And there’s something special in using oat drink for cooking oatmeal. It just feels right.</p><p>The blueberries-banana-raspberries combo is worth a few words. First, it’s a perfect mix of sweetness and acidity. I usually do about 50g of blueberries and raspberries, and one banana per portion. Berries complement banana nicely and also add those tiny bursts of juice when you bite them. I love it so much.</p><p>Lastly, walnuts make this one more nutritious. If you microwave them with the oats at 900w for 1m40s, they also become soft and perfectly match mushy banana.</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/IMG_5795.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/IMG_5795.jpg 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/IMG_5795.jpg 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/IMG_5795.jpg 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/IMG_5795.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Watching the sunrise at 6 a.m. from the 29th floor in Minsk, Belarus. Looks like a nuclear bomb.</figcaption></figure><p>The mornings are special to me. </p><p>If I waste a second in the morning, I feel like the day is not going well already. This leads to anxiety, stress, and busyness of mind.</p><p>But if I win the morning, I almost always win the day. That’s why I move through those precious morning hours almost like a robot, performing the same routine over and over again. I only break the habit on some exceptional occasions. For example, last week, I’d been helping a friend with a YC application until 3 am and woke up at about 9.</p><hr><p>I wake up at 5:30 and go straight to the bathroom. I wash my face, clean my teeth, and go to the toilet. At 5:40, I put up training clothes and begin working out. After about 50 minutes of HIIT, I take a shower and go downstairs to have breakfast. I turn on some music like Christmas Jazz on Spotify (it’s September, I know, but so what?) and begin cooking my breakfast.</p><p>First, I get my dishes ready. I open the cupboard and take one deep plate and one flat. I also bring two spoons and a cup to pour some oat drink. This may sound like a hell of a process, but you’d be surprised if you saw how automatic it is.</p><p>Once the dishes are out there, I grab the ingredients. I take the oatmeal and nuts from the cupboard and bring fruit, berries, and oat drink from the fridge. </p><p>I open the oatmeal pack and pour some rolled oats into the deep dish. About 2/3 is enough; more will not leave enough space for fruit and berries. Next, I add some walnut pieces on top of the rolled oats and begin pouring the thing with oat drink. I add the liquid gradually, giving oats the time to soak some of the liquid so that the whole thing becomes consistent. Once pouring is done, I mix the oatmeal with a large spoon and bring it to the microwave.</p><p>I set the microwave for 900W and 2 minutes; that’s the best mode of cooking oatmeal I’ve found so far. Once the microwave starts heating the oatmeal, I begin washing banana and blueberries, my current favorite mix. Usually, I try to do it in parallel and manage to get the banana cut in small circles right before 1:20-1:30 hits. At this time, I throw the knife away and jump to the microwave to save the oatmeal.</p><p>Sometimes I fail.</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/IMG_0684.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/IMG_0684.jpg 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/IMG_0684.jpg 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/IMG_0684.jpg 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/IMG_0684.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>There’s no way to mastery without mistakes.</figcaption></figure><p>But in most cases, it’s okay. I <em>feel</em> when it’s ready and usually pause the microwave at about 1:20. I open the microwave and mix the oatmeal with a large spoon. I’ve found mixing to be necessary for rolled oats to become soft enough to not get stuck between my teeth and not too soft to turn into porridge. Just right. After I’m done with mixing, I close the microwave and resume heating.</p><p>After two minutes are done, the microwave stops. I grab my small flat plate and cover the oatmeal. This helps to steam cook rolled oats a bit more to make them soft.</p><p>Once I get the oatmeal covered, I begin preparing fruit and berries. If you ever played fruit ninja, you know exactly what I mean. I tried all sorts of forms but found banana to be the most delicious when cut into medium width circles, about .3 inches wide. Once the banana is ready, I uncover the oatmeal plate and put banana in there. Then I mix it up with the oatmeal with a large spoon. </p><p>By this point, the oatmeal is already great. But I’ve found that mixing it up with banana and leaving covered for another 30 seconds makes it just perfect. The oats soften even more and the whole thing becomes more consistent and viscous, and I love it that way.</p><p>After the oatmeal is ready, I add berries on top. I used to mix them with oats, but now I just add them on top because berries look nicer if they’re not covered with the oatmeal mucus.</p><p>I pour a cup of oat drink, bring the dish to my table, take a picture, and begin eating.</p><p>You just spent five minutes reading about how I cook oatmeal for breakfast. Or you didn’t. In both cases, you might be wondering why I am telling you all of this. And how on Earth can a person be so stoked about microwaving oatmeal for breakfast; it doesn’t sound very exciting. He seems to be very passionate about it.</p><p>When I began practicing, I wasn’t. All I wanted was to find an easy to cook breakfast, and nothing more.</p><p>But day after day, I was getting better at cooking oatmeal. I started being curious about it and began experimenting with ingredients, milk and oats. Months later, I stopped thinking about cooking when I was doing it. My body was in perfect sync with my mind, and I started moving like a dancer around the kitchen. I was in the flow.</p><p>That’s when passion came. I became passionate about oatmeal <em>after</em> I’ve become good at it. And if you told me a year ago that I’d be passionate about putting a bunch of oats in the microwave, I’d never believed you.</p><p>So don’t believe people who sell you on the idea of following your passion. It’s very seductive because all the cool guys seem to be very passionate about what they do. But if you think about it, there are two ways to this place. You can begin with passion and develop greatness. Or you can become a master and pick up some passion <a href="https://youtu.be/uaSqh4DiQSw">along the way</a>.</p><p>And as most people preach the first one, I naturally think the opposite is true. Here’s a quick thought experiment to try. Play back your childhood and try to understand <em>why</em> you became passionate about some things and not the others. You were likely naturally good at them. Or you figured them out way faster than other kids did. In any case, you tried lots of stuff.</p><p>Now, apply this passion discovery idea to the present. Instead of following your small set of existing passions, try to broaden them a little bit first. <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/">Learn a bunch of things</a>. Experiment. Become a master at something. No matter if you succeed or fail, you’ll discover something amusing about yourself. And I bet that passion will follow.</p>

<p>Isn’t it weird that we treat source code as text? That is, we have this extremely well-structured and strongly-typed object — the abstract syntax tree — that exists conceptually in our minds, and in actuality inside of our compiler, but for some reason we pretend it’s just a pile of bytes and edit it byte-by-byte rather than semantically?</p>
<p>When you stop and think about it, that’s like the stupidest idea ever. We as the authors don’t think of our code as bytes, nor does our interpreter or compiler. But instead we take the semantic understanding inside of our heads, serialize it into bytes, and then get the compiler to parse and rediscover the ideas inside our head. What a waste of effort.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use the incredible <a href="https://totbwf.github.io/">TOTBWF</a> and my new Tactics Plugin for the <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server">Haskell Language Server</a>, which will automatically and intelligently fill holes in your Haskell programs.</p>
<p>This blog post describes what a tactics engine is and why you want one, and is a good introduction to how in the hell we can automatically write your code for you.</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re pair programming with a junior engineer. In the navigator seat, you’ll be guiding your partner through the implementation, guiding them through the high-level strokes and letting them actually do the coding part. In order to implement <code>foldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b</code>, for example, the guidance you give your partner might be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bind the function arguments</li>
<li>Case split on the <code>[a]</code> parameter</li>
<li>If it’s <code>[]</code>, do the obvious thing</li>
<li>Otherwise call your function and recurse.</li>
</ol>
<p>These instructions aren’t a real program by any means, but you might call them a “program sketch.” The hard part of programming (thinking about what to do) is captured here, but <em>actually doing it</em> is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>A tactics engine transforms a program sketch like the above into an actual program. Tactics free us from the tyranny of text editing and pedantic details, allowing us to work at a higher semantic level of programming.</p>
<p>Tactics correspond to semantic operations over our program. Much like how the primitive commands in text editors (delete to end of line, insert parentheses, etc) can be composed to refine the textual representation of one program into the textual representation of another, we can compose small tactics in order to build larger ideas.</p>
<p>As an example, consider how we can fill in the following hole:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>data</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Id</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-2"></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Id</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>  fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb1-5">  <span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Rather than writing this function all at once, we can instead build it, one idea at a time. The first step is obviously to bind function arguments (the <code>intros</code> tactic), which results in the refined expression:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’re left with a new hole, but this one is “smaller” than the old one; we’ve refined the previous hole, filling in some of its structure. As a result, the type of our new hole is <code>Id b</code>, and we now have both <code>fab :: a -&gt; b</code> and <code>ida :: Id a</code> in scope. We can simplify the hole further by now pattern matching on <code>ida</code> (the <code>destruct ida</code> tactic):</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ida <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">  <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The resulting hole still has type <code>Id b</code>, but we’ve now introduced <code>a :: a</code> in scope. Our next step is to build an <code>Id</code> value, which we can do by producing its data constructor (the <code>split</code> tactic):</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ida <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">  <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again we’ve shrunk the problem — now our hole has type <code>b</code>. At this point we can call the <code>fab</code> function to produce a <code>b</code> (via the <code>apply fab</code> tactic):</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ida <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3">  <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> (fab _)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All that’s left is a hole with type <code>a</code>. Fortunately, we have <code>a :: a</code> in scope, so we can just plop that in to the hole via the <code>assumption</code> tactic:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ida <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3">  <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> (fab a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And just like that, we’ve produced an implementation of our desired function! By thinking in terms of the semantic operations we’d like to perform at each hole (instead of how to manipulate the bytes of text), we’ve changed the level of abstraction at which we think about editing. The implications of this might not be immediately obvious, so let’s explore them together.</p>
<p>Let’s list the tactic steps we took to derive <code>fmap</code>:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">intros</span>
<span id="cb7-2">destruct ida</span>
<span id="cb7-3">split</span>
<span id="cb7-4">apply fab</span>
<span id="cb7-5">assumption</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Up to alpha renaming, this composition of tactics is sufficient to derive <code>fmap</code> for any sum or product type that doesn’t do anything “exciting” with its type variable. By running the same steps, we can implement <code>fmap</code> for any of the following types:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">(a, b)</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>Either</span> a b</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><span>Maybe</span> a</span>
<span id="cb8-4"><span>Const</span> a b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s convince ourselves of this by quickly running through the derivation for <code>Maybe a</code>. We start again with <code>fmap</code> and its type:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After running <code>intros</code>:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then <code>destruct ma</code></p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> _</span>
<span id="cb11-4">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Applying <code>split</code> here is a little tricky; technically it will force us to try both <code>Nothing</code> and <code>Just _</code> at each hole in a weird sort of quantum superposition. Let’s ignore this detail for right now, and come back to it immediately after finishing the derivation. Assuming we pick the right data cons, after <code>split</code> our program looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we run <code>apply fab</code>. Because <code>Nothing</code> doesn’t take any arguments, it didn’t produce any holes, so we need look only at the <code>Just</code> case:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> (fab _)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and finally we run <code>assumption</code> to fill in the hole:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb14-4">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> (fab a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Look at that! Even though it would require significantly different editing commands to write the syntax of these two functor instances, they are both descried by the same composition of tactics. This is what I mean by “semantic editing,” we’re moving the algorithm for producing functor instances out of our heads and reifying it into something the computer understands. In essence, by writing <code>fmap</code> once, we can teach the computer how to write it for us in the future.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that <code>split</code> gives us some issues here. Reading closely, you’ll notice that there is nothing in our tactics that say we need to <code>split</code> the same data constructor that we just <code>destruct</code>ed. In actuality there are four different, valid programs that can be produced by the above set of tactics:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb15-3">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb15-4"></span>
<span id="cb15-5"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb15-6">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb15-7">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> (fab a)</span>
<span id="cb15-8"></span>
<span id="cb15-9"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb15-10">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> _</span>
<span id="cb15-11">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb15-12"></span>
<span id="cb15-13"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb15-14">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> _</span>
<span id="cb15-15">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> (fab a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Choosing the “best” implementation of these possibilities is largely a matter of heuristics, which I plan to describe in a later post. For now, let’s just assume our tactics engine is smart enough to come up with the one you had in mind.</p>
<p>Of course, the real issue here is that nothing forces our <code>destruct</code> and <code>split</code> tactics to use the same data constructor. We can eliminate this ambiguity by noticing that in <code>fmap</code>, we’re not actually trying to destruct and then split, but instead we’re trying to implement a homomorphism (a structure-preserving function.) In order to preserve structure, we’d better map a data constructor to itself. So instead, let’s use the <code>homo</code> tactic instead of <code>destruct</code> and <code>split</code>. Our new tactics metaprogram for writing functor instances is thus:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1">intros</span>
<span id="cb16-2">homo ida</span>
<span id="cb16-3">apply fab</span>
<span id="cb16-4">assumption</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This new version now can no longer generate any of the pathological <code>fmap</code> implementations for <code>Maybe</code>, as they are not structure preserving. We’re left only with the good implementation. Let’s do one more derivation, this time for <code>Either c a</code>. After <code>intros</code> and <code>homo eca</code>, we’re left with:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c b</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> eca <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb17-3">  <span>Left</span>  c <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Left</span> _</span>
<span id="cb17-4">  <span>Right</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Right</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the first time, we’re now left with <em>two</em> holes. The default behavior is for a tactic to apply to all holes (although there are combinators for “zipping” holes), meaning that the <code>apply fab</code> tactic will be run on both holes. For the <code>Left</code> case, our hole has type <code>c</code>, but <code>fab _</code> has type <code>b</code>, so this tactic <em>fails to apply here.</em> Tactic failure is per-hole, so we can still apply it to the other hole, resulting in:</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c b</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> eca <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3">  <span>Left</span>  c <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Left</span> _</span>
<span id="cb18-4">  <span>Right</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Right</span> (fab _)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And finally, <code>assumption</code> fills the hole with whatever would typecheck. In the first hole that’s <code>c</code>, and in the second it’s <code>a</code> as before.</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c b</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> eca <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3">  <span>Left</span>  c <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Left</span> c</span>
<span id="cb19-4">  <span>Right</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Right</span> (fab a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Amazing! Three different functor implementations, with different numbers of data constructors, type variables, and cardinalities. By programming at the level of tactics rather than bytes, we can ignore the superficial differences between these implementations, focusing instead on the fact that they’re all derived the same way.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post has given you some insight into what tactics are and why they’re valuable. In the next post we’ll look at how this stuff is implemented behind the scenes, and the difficulties we’ve had integrating it into the language server. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>What if I told you you could use a single property value to turn multiple different values on and off across multiple different properties and even across multiple CSS rules?</p>



<p>What if I told you you could turn this flat button into a glossy skeuomorphic button by just tweaking one custom property <code>--is-raised</code>, and that would set its border, background image, box and text shadows in one fell swoop?</p>

<p><em>How</em>, you may ask?</p>



<p>The crux of this technique is this: There are two custom property values that work almost everywhere there is a <code>var()</code> call with a fallback.</p>



<p>The more obvious one that you probably already know is the <code>initial</code> value, which makes the property just apply its fallback. So, in the following code:</p>



<pre><code>background: var(--foo, linear-gradient(white, transparent)) hsl(220 10% 50%);
border: 1px solid var(--foo, rgb(0 0 0 / .1));
color: rgb(0 0 0 var(--foo, / .8));</code></pre>



<p>We can set <code>--foo</code> to <code>initial</code> to enable these “fallbacks” and append these values to the property value, adding a gradient, setting a border-color, and making the text color translucent in one go. But what to do when we want to turn these values <em>off</em>? Any non-initial value for <code>--foo</code> (that doesn’t create cycles) should work. But is there one that works in all three declarations?</p>



<p>It turns out there <em>is</em> another value that works everywhere, in every property a <code>var()</code> reference is present, and you’d likely never guess what it is (unless you have watched any of my CSS variable talks and have a good memory for passing mentions of things).</p>



<p><em>Intrigued?</em></p>



<p>It’s whitespace! <strong>Whitespace is significant in a custom property.</strong> When you write something like this:</p>



<pre><code>--foo: ;</code></pre>



<p>This is <strong>not</strong> an invalid declaration. This is a declaration where the value of <code>--foo</code> is literally one space character. However, whitespace is valid in every CSS property value, everywhere a <code>var()</code> is allowed, and does not affect its computed value in any way. So, we can just set our property to one space (or even a comment) and not affect any other value present in the declaration. E.g. this:</p>



<pre><code>--foo: ;
background: var(--foo, linear-gradient(white, transparent)) hsl(220 10% 50%);</code></pre>



<p>produces the same result as:</p>



<pre><code>background: hsl(220 10% 50%);</code></pre>



<p>We can take advantage of this to essentially turn <code>var()</code> into a single-clause <code>if()</code> function and conditionally append values based on a single custom property.</p>



<p>As a proof of concept, here is the two button demo refactored using this approach:</p>











<h3>Limitations</h3>



<p>I originally envisioned this as a building block for a <s>technique</s><em> horrible hack</em> to enable “mixins” in the browser, since <a href="https://www.xanthir.com/b4o00">@apply is now defunct</a>. However, the big limitation is that this only works for appending values to existing values — or setting a property to either a whole value or <code>initial</code>. There is no way to say “the background should be red if <code>--foo</code> is set and white otherwise”. Some such conditionals can be emulated with clever use of appending, but not most. </p>



<p>And of course there’s a certain readability issue: <code>--foo: ;</code> looks like a mistake and <code>--foo: initial</code> looks pretty weird, unless you’re aware of this technique. However, that can easily be solved with comments. Or even constants: </p>



<pre><code>:root {
	--ON: initial;
	--OFF: ;
}

button {
	--is-raised: var(--OFF);
	/* ... */
}

#foo {
	--is-raised: var(--ON);
}</code></pre>



<p>Also do note that eventually we will get a proper <code>if()</code> and won’t need such horrible hacks to emulate it, discussions are already underway [<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5009">w3c/csswg-drafts#5009</a> <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4731">w3c/csswg-drafts#4731</a>].</p>



<p>So what do you think? Horrible hack, useful technique, or both? 😀</p>

<h3>[ 2020-October-12 10:26 ]</h3>
<p>As part of investigating the durability provided by cloud systems, I wanted to make sure I understood the basics. I started by <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-nvme.html">reading the NVMe specification, to understand the guarantees provided by disks</a>. The summary is that you should assume your data is corrupt between when a write is issued until after a flush or force unit access write completes. However, most programs use system calls to write data. This article looks at the guarantees provided by the Linux file APIs. It seems like this should be simple: a program calls <code>write()</code> and after it completes, the data is durable. However, <code>write()</code> only copies data from the application into the kernel's cache in memory. To force the data to be durable you need to use some additional mechanism. This article is a messy collection of notes about what I've learned. (The really brief summary: use fdatasync or open with O_DSYNC.) For a better and clearer overview, see LWN's <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/457667/">Ensuring data reaches disk</a>, which walks from application code through to the disk.</p>


<h2>The semantics of write()</h2>

<p>The write system call is defined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">IEEE POSIX standard</a> as attempting to write data to a file descriptor. After it successfully returns, reads are required to return the bytes that were written, even when read or written by other processes or threads (<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/write.html#tag_16_685_08">POSIX standard write(); Rationale</a>). There is an addition note under <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_09_07">Thread Interactions with Regular File Operations</a> that says "If two threads each call one of these functions, each call shall either see all of the specified effects of the other call, or none of them." This suggests that all file I/O must effectively hold a lock.</p>

<p>Does that mean write is atomic? Technically, yes: future reads must return the entire contents of the write, or none of it. However, write is not required to be <em>complete</em>, and is allowed to only transfer <em>part</em> of the data. For example, we could have two threads, each appending 1024-bytes to a single file descriptor. It would be acceptable for the two writes to each only write a single byte. This is still "atomic", but also results in undesirable interleaved output. There is a great <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42442926/413438">StackOverflow answer with more details</a>.</p>


<h2>fsync/fdatasync</h2>

<p>The most straightforward way to get your data on disk is to call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html">fsync()</a>. It requests the operating system to transfer all modified blocks in cache to disk, along with all file metadata (e.g. access time, modification time, etc). In my opinion, that metadata is rarely useful, so you should use fdatasync unless you know you need the metadata. The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fdatasync.2.html">fdatasync man page</a> says it is required to flush as much metadata as necessary "for a subsequent data read to be handled correctly", which is what most applications care about.</p>

<p>One issue is this is not guaranteed to ensure you can <em>find</em> the file again. In particular, when you first create a file, you need to call fsync on the directory that contains it, otherwise it might not exist after a failure. The reason is basically that in UNIX, a file can exist in multiple directories due to hard links, so when you call fsync on a file, there is no way to tell which directories should be written out (<a href="https://www.quora.com/When-should-you-fsync-the-containing-directory-in-addition-to-the-file-itself">more details</a>). It appears that ext4 may actually <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/799807/">fsync the directory automatically, but that might not be true for other filesystems</a>.</p>

<p>The way this is implemented will vary depending on the file system. I used <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/blktrace.git/tree/README">blktrace</a> to examine what disk operations ext4 and xfs use. They both issue normal disk writes for both the file data and the file system journal, use a cache flush, then finish with a FUA write to the journal, probably to indicate the operation has committed. On disks that do not support FUA, this involves two cache flushes. My experiments show that fdatasync is slightly faster than fsync, and blktrace shows fdatasync tends to write a bit less data (ext4: 20 kiB for fsync vs 16 kiB for fdatasync). My experiments also show that xfs is slightly faster than ext4, and again blktrace shows it tends to flush less data (xfs: 4 kiB for fdatasync).</p>


<h2>fsync controversies</h2>

<p>In my professional career, I can remember three fsync-related controversies. The first, in 2008, was that Firefox 3's UI would hang when lots of files were being written. The problem is the UI used the SQLite database to save state, which provides strong durability guarantees by calling fsync after each commit. On the ext3 filesystem of the time, fsync wrote out <em>all</em> dirty pages on the system, rather than just the relevant file. This meant that clicking a button in Firefox could wait for many megabytes of data to be written on magnetic disks, which could take seconds. The solution, as I understand <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2008/05/25/fsyncers-and-curveballs/">from a blog</a>, was to move many database commits to asynchronous background tasks. This means Firefox was previously using stronger durability guarantees than it needed, although the problem was made much worse by the ext3 filesystem.</p>

<p>The second controversy, in 2009, was that after a system crash, users of the new ext4 filesystem found many recently created files would have zero length, which did not happen with the older ext3 filesystem. In the previous controversy, ext3 was flushing too much data, which caused really slow fsync calls. To fix it, ext4 flushes only the relevant dirty pages to disk. For other files, it keeps them in memory for much longer to improve performance (defaulting to 30 seconds, configured with <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt">dirty_expire_centiseconds</a>; <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg68941.html">note</a>). This means after a crash, lots of data might be missing. The solution is to add fsyncs to applications that want to ensure data will survive crashes, since fsyncs are much more efficient with ext4. The downside is this still makes operations like installing software slower. For more details, see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/322823/">LWN's article</a>, or <a href="https://thunk.org/tytso/blog/2009/03/12/delayed-allocation-and-the-zero-length-file-problem/">Ted Ts'o's explaination</a>.</p>

<p>The third controversy, in 2018, is that Postgres discovered that when fsync encounters an error, it can mark dirty pages as "clean", so future calls to fsync do nothing. This leaves modified pages in memory that are never written to disk. This is pretty catastrophic, since the application thinks some data has been written, but it has not. There are very few things an application can do in this rare case when fsync fails. Postgres and many other applications now crash when it happens. A paper titled <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/rebello">Can Applications Recover from fsync Failures?</a> published in USENIX ATC 2020 investigates the issue in detail. The best solution at the moment is to use Direct I/O with O_SYNC or O_DSYNC, which will report errors on specific write operations, but requires the application to manage buffers itself. For more details, see the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752063/">LWN article</a> or the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Fsync_Errors">Postgres wiki page about fsync errors</a>.</p>


<h2>open with O_SYNC/O_DSYNC</h2>

<p>Back to system calls for durability. Another option is to use the O_SYNC or O_DSYNC options with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open() system call</a>. This causes every write to have the same semantics as a write followed by fsync/fdatasync, respectively. The POSIX specification calls this <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap03.html#tag_03_373">Synchronized I/O File Integrity Completion and Data Integrity Completion</a>. The main advantage of this approach is that you need a single system call, instead of write followed by fdatasync. The biggest disadvantage is that all writes using that file descriptor will be synchronized, which may limit how the application code is structured.</p>


<h2>Direct I/O with O_DIRECT</h2>

<p>The open() system call has an O_DIRECT option which is intended to bypass the operating system's cache, and instead do I/O directly with the disk. This means in many cases, an application's write call will translate directly into a disk command. However, in general this is not a replacement for fsync or fdatasync, since the <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-nvme.html">disk itself is free to delay or cache those writes</a>. Even worse, there are <a href="https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Clarifying_Direct_IO%27s_Semantics">edge cases that mean O_DIRECT I/O falls back to traditional buffered I/O</a>. The easiest solution is to also use the O_DSYNC option to open, which means each write is effectively followed by fdatasync.</p>

<p>It turns out that XFS somewhat recently added a "fast path" for O_DIRECT|O_DSYNC writes. If you are overwriting blocks with O_DIRECT|O_DSYNC, XFS will issue a FUA write if the device supports it, rather than using a cache flush. I used blktrace to confirm this happens on my Linux 5.4/Ubuntu 20.04 system. This should be more efficient, since it writes the minimum amount of data to disk, and uses a single operation instead of a write followed by a cache flush. I found a link to the <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10250257/">kernel patch that implemented this in 2018</a>, which has some discussion about implementing this optimization for other filesystems, but as far as I know XFS is the only one that does.</p>


<h2>sync_file_range</h2>

<p>Linux also has <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sync_file_range.2.html">sync_file_range</a>, which can allow flushing <em>part</em> of a file to disk, rather than the entire file, and triggering an asynchronous flush, rather than waiting for it. However, the man page states that it is "extremely dangerous" and discourages its use. The best description of some of the differences and dangers with sync_file_range is <a href="http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2014/03/how-syncfilerange-really-works.html">Yoshinori Matsunobu's post about how it works</a>. Notably, it seems that RocksDB uses this to control when the kernel flushes dirty data to disk, and still uses fdatasync to ensure durability. It <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/search?q=sync_file_range">has some interesting comments in its source code</a>. For example, it appears that with zfs, the sync_file_range call does not actually flush data. Given my experience that code that is rarely used probably has bugs, I would recommend avoiding this system call without very good reasons.</p>


<h2>System calls for durable I/O</h2>

<p>My conclusion is there are basically three approaches for durable I/O. All of them require you to call fsync() on the containing directory when you first create a file.</p>

<ol>
<li>fdatasync or fsync after a write (prefer fdatasync).</li>
<li>write on a file descriptor opened with O_DSYNC or O_SYNC (prefer O_DSYNC).</li>
<li>pwritev2 with the RWF_DSYNC or RWF_SYNC flag (prefer RWF_DSYNC).</li>
</ol>


<h2>Some random performance observations</h2>

<p>I have not measured these carefully, and many of these differences are very small, which means they could be false, or are highly likely to change. These are roughly ordered from …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve always been suspicious of the idea of being attached to a company.</p><p>It could be because of the leftist spirit of my generation in France, or because of my readings during my student years, or because of my familial history (which saw way more self-employed, farmers, nurses or teachers than company employees), but I’ve never accepted the idea of giving even a tiny portion of my independence of mind to a company. When I was a student, I wasn’t dreaming about joining a company like Google, who seemed too sectarian to me, to rather prefer boring companies, where we only expect you to work well. Keeping a distance from my company was, I thought, the way to stay <em>who I am</em>, without being infected by an external force.</p><p>It doesn’t mean that I didn’t care about my job. I’ve always been involved in my work, being proactive in bringing new technologies, mentoring the other developers, helping the team to grow, but I was doing this just because I liked my job. I was not considering this as something important in my career, simply because I didn’t want too. To develop my career, I was spending a lot of time outside work reading technical books, doing toy projects, going to meetups, browsing Hacker News. I was finding here what my company was fundamentally unable to give me, and I was feeling holding my fate in my own hands. I thought it was the best recipe to end with a successful career, while remaining free and protected from the meanders of corporate culture (or corporate politics, actually).</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>First, most recruiters don’t care about your personal projects or how many meetups you went during the year.
What matters the most is your current company - and by that I mean the name of your current company. It was saddening me before, but now that I’m on the other side today, with a manager position, I better understand this. This is plain common sense. You can generally assume that a developer coming from a cutting-edge company has better chances to be a great developer than a developer coming from a Java 1.4 shop. He may not be smarter, but he has been hired by a company with a most demanding hiring process, and has been surrounded by some of the smartest developers.</p><p>Worse, having too many personal projects can raise a flag and be scary for the recruiter. When my entrepreneurial experience has been over, I was disappointed and somewhat regretful of some of our choices, but generally proud of everything we did and excited to share my story to recruiters. I was surprised to see that most of them were only asking questions about my previous experiences as an employee. My CTO experience was an anomaly, at best two lost years, at worst a sign that I was too independent, too individualistic, not a good team player. Only relatively small and ambitious startups, like the one I’m in today, were valuing this experience.<br>Today, I recommend not hiding your side projects, but to not displaying them as a primary part of your identity, to not scare the recruiter and let him feel that you have a secondary plan.</p><p>Secondly, I don’t think that multiplying the side projects is useful unless they are substantial.
Side projects that we consider futile, that we do just to get away from our daily work, don’t make us better in our job. The things that make us progress are the issues we want to avoid and that generally come only when your toy project has been transformed into a product and when you have to deal with users, production issues, and money (your money). Basically, all the things that no one wants to do on his free time. Even from a purely technical point of view, you will not really understand a library or a framework by just sticking to the tutorial or its basic features. You’ll have to dig into and to face its most painful aspects to deeply understand it.</p><p>Shallow side projects are useful to develop a first opinion about a technology that will need to be confirmed with a more elaborate project. I’d compare them to school.<br>When I was a teenager, I remember what we were saying about it: <em>it will never help us in our future job</em>. After all, how teachings about antiderivatives, Rimbaud’s poetry or Napoleonic wars could be useful for our future adult life? We were right. Most of what we learned is pretty useless today, whether you are a cook, a hairdresser or a developer.<br>But this formed a complete package that infuses our adult life. Junior school is great because you don’t learn to find a job. You’re at school to grow as a citizen, not to prepare to your future life, and actually you’re better not to think about your future if you don’t want to question yourself about the meaning of your existence. This is the same thing for side projects. See them as a way to discover a new topic and enlarge your horizon, not as something that you could action in your current position or to find a new job. Otherwise, you expose yourself to severe disillusions.</p><p>The best way to dig a new technology is to practice it in your daily job. You’ll spend seven hours a day on it and will quickly become infinitely more proficient than if you just barely used it on nights and weekends. You may tell me that we face a chicken or egg problem here. How to get a job where you’ll work on a really attractive technology if you never used it before? Well, instead of spending nights superficially learning this technology, spend your nights preparing interviews. Read “Cracking the code interview”, learn everything you need to know about algorithms and binary trees. As we all know, the interview process is broken. Instead of deploring it, take advantage of it.</p><p>I don’t want to make this blog post a rant against side projects. In fact, I’m advocating the exact opposite. Continue to do as many side projects as ever, code on nights and weekends if you want to, but don’t do them because you think they could be useful to you to get a new job. This is wrong. I know too many developers who are stuck into this pipe dream. This is an illusion and this leads to a waste of time and energy.</p><p>Don’t create a project just to prove that you know Vue.js, but use this weird technology that you saw yesterday on Hacker News and that intrigues you. Don’t think about what are the best (and boring) blog post topics that could expand your personal branding, but write poetry or a review of the last movie you saw. Create the apps, services, websites, or video games you want to use. These side-projects are truly great. They may not make your portfolio or your public image convincing for the next recruiter you’ll meet, but this is how you will be able to express all that you have in you and end up affirming yourself. At least, you should end having something meaningful to show, something to be proud about.</p><p>You want to feel free and have time for your projects? Focus your efforts on joining a great company. This will make your career considerably easier and will make you as free as you wanted to be initially. The link you’ll develop with your company will be a source of discomfort sometimes, but it will protect you from the never-ending competition on the job market. The satisfaction of seeing your career flourishing while you will use all your free time to do what you like (including… side projects) will give you a valuable peace of mind.<br>By trading a little bit of what you think is your independence, you’ll get the real one.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p><em>zheap</em> is a way to <strong>keep table bloat under control</strong> by implementing a new PostgreSQL storage engine capable of running <strong><code>UPDATE</code>-intense workloads</strong> more efficiently. The project was originally started by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/">EnterpriseDB</a>.</p>

<p>To make <em>zheap</em> ready for production, we are proud to announce that our partners at <a href="https://heroiclabs.com/">Heroic Labs</a> have committed to <strong>fund the development</strong> of <em>zheap</em> and <strong>release all code to the community</strong>. <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/">CYBERTEC</a> has decided to <strong>double the funding amount</strong>, and to put up additional expertise and manpower to move <em>zheap</em> forward.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>Table bloat describes the phenomenon of tables and / or indices growing in size, even if the amount of data stored in the database stays constant. If one wants to support transactions it is necessary not to overwrite data in case it is rolled back.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL copies rows on <code>UPDATE</code> and stores them in the same table. Stale rows are periodically garbage-collected by an automatic process called <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html">VACUUM</a>. Problems start to crop up in <code>UPDATE</code>-heavy workloads, as VACUUM might not always be able to keep up.</p>

<h3 id="how">How?</h3>

<p>CYBERTEC has started a <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/zheap-reinvented-postgresql-storage/">series of blog posts</a> that go into the design-goals of <em>zheap</em>.</p>

                    <p>Decision-making is easy. In most cases, we already know what to do. And then we spend weeks, convincing ourselves it’s the best option. Sometimes, we never get to make the call.</p><p>Why are we doing this to ourselves?</p><ol><li>First, because we expect serious decision-making to be really hard. Maybe we even <em>want</em> it to be hard. Because if we spend weeks instead of minutes on deciding and fuck it up anyways, we’ll have a sound excuse for ourselves — “But I tried my best!”</li><li>Second, we always try to come up with the very best option. Because the stakes are damn high. This is a straight path to a weird world called Analysis-Paralysis, where we get stuck for ages.</li></ol><p>This year, I’ve made more tough decisions than ever in my life. I decided to shut down the startup we were working on, <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/3-weeks-of-shaolin-kung-fu-in-china/">fly to China to study Shaolin Kung-Fu</a>, and pass on a dream job offer to start a new venture and move to London.</p><p>And I would never have made them without thought experiments.</p><h2 id="what-are-thought-experiments">What are thought experiments</h2><p>In its simplest, thought experiments are questions. Very well-structured hypothetical questions that employ our subjunctive reasoning, like <em>“What might happen if...?”</em></p><p>By using these hypothetical questions, we get two things:</p><ol><li>We gain new information. Just by looking at already known empirical data from a different and unusual perspective, we can draw new (a priori) inferences for our decision.</li><li>We invoke intuition. This is more important and less obvious. For many decisions, we already know the right answer. It just <em>feels</em> right. We need the guts to make the call.</li></ol><p>To improve my decision-making, I’ve carefully explored and tested hundreds of thought experiments. To save you months on doing the same, I’ve collected the best nine in this post. They come from brilliant people, whom I credit gratefully for their work.</p><p>Please don’t think about these experiments as a checklist to go through when making a decision. Think for yourself which one might be a good fit and apply it wisely.</p><h2 id="1-the-simulation-by-tim-urban">1. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html">The Simulation, by Tim Urban</a></h2><p>This is my favorite thought experiment (and most powerful).</p><p>Here’s how Tim describes it:</p><p>If someone gave you a perfect simulation of today’s world to play in and told you that it’s all fake with no actual consequences—with the only rules being that you can’t break the law or harm anyone, and you still have to make sure to support your and your family’s basic needs — what would you do?</p><hr><p>It works is by removing risk from the equation — if I have one more life anyway, why not try this crazy thing? It took me a few weeks to realize how deep is the thought behind it: there’s no difference whatsoever between the simulation and real life. </p><p>Once you accept that truth, your most risky desires start popping up.</p><h2 id="2-the-movie-guy-by-joe-rogan">2. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysTGb27yCcc?t=191">The Movie Guy, by Joe Rogan</a></h2><p>Here’s how Joe describes it:</p><p>Live your life like you’re the hero in your movie. And right now is when the fucking movie starts and your life is a shit bag disaster. Pretend you are, right now, you’re in the part of the movie that starts and it shows you as a fucking loser. And just decide not to be a loser.</p><p>Live your life like this is a documentary crew following you around, analyzing you. Do what you want to do so your kids one day will look back at it and see that documentary and look on it with pride, like, wow, my dad was a bad motherfucker, he really did what he had to do. Wow, my mom really got her shit together.</p><p>I’d love a success story, but even more than a success story I like a dude who fucks his life up and then gets it back together again story; those are my favorite stories. And the way to do that — you gotta write shit down, you gotta think that you are the hero in your own fucking movie, and then you gotta sit down, and you gotta write shit down. Write down what you need to do.</p><hr><p>The question:</p><blockquote>What would the movie guy do? – Joe Rogan</blockquote><h2 id="3-the-deathbed-me-by-tim-urban">3. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html">The Deathbed Me, by Tim Urban</a></h2><p>Here’s how Tim describes it:</p><p>The deathbed test is casting yourself into the distant future, imagining yourself lying on your deathbed and asking what your future self would want you to do at the current juncture of your life.</p><p>To stay on the 'default' path you’re travelling now – complete with its comfort, certainty, status and security – or to take the road less travelled? To go with the convenient 'less hassle' option, or to dig deep and to veer onto a path that tugs at your heart, despite the comforts you have to give up in the process?</p><p>Let’s face it, there will always be many reasons to justify taking the easier path, sticking with the status quo and avoiding the possibility of failure. Yet the longer I am alive, the more firmly I believe that living a life that nurtures our souls, and not just a short-term sense of comfort or security or status, will often require trading comfort for inconvenience, security for uncertainty, and going that extra mile (or 10,000!) when you can easily justify not bothering.</p><p>So what about you? As you think about the big decisions in your career and life, and perhaps a few of the smaller ones, are you currently on a path that puts you at risk of one day looking back and wondering, perhaps regretfully, <em>‘What if I’d tried?’</em></p><hr><p>The question:</p><blockquote>Am I currently on a path that puts me at risk of one day looking back and wondering, perhaps regretfully, “what if I’d tried?” – Tim Urban</blockquote><h2 id="4-the-regret-minimization-framework-by-jeff-bezos">4. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ">The Regret Minimization Framework, by Jeff Bezos</a></h2><p>Here’s how Jeff describes it:</p><p>The framework I found, which made the decision incredibly easy, was what I called — which only a nerd would call — a “regret minimization framework.” So I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, “Okay, now I’m looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have.”</p><p>I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so, when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision.</p><p>And I think that’s a very good if you can project yourself out to age 80 and think, <em>“What will I think at that time?”</em> it gets you away from some of the daily pieces of confusion. You know, I left this Wall Street firm in the middle of the year. When you do that, you walk away from your annual bonus and that’s the kind of thing where there short-term can confuse you but if you think about the long-term then you can really make good life decisions that you won’t regret later.</p><hr><p>Sam Altman also <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short">adds on this</a>:</p><p>If you think you’re going to regret not doing something, you should probably do it. &nbsp;Regret is the worst, and most people regret far more things they didn’t do than things they did do. When in doubt, kiss the boy/girl.</p><p>Gary Vee also <a href="https://youtu.be/KFYolTZXidA">adds on this</a>:</p><p>What kids struggle with is the decision they want to do versus the decision that they think they’re supposed to do based on the other voices. Nobody old and about to die talks about what they did. They talk about what they <em>didn’t</em> do. Don’t not do what you wanna do.</p><p>The question:</p><blockquote>At the age of 80, will I regret not doing this? – Jeff Bezos</blockquote><h2 id="5-fear-setting-by-tim-ferris">5. <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/">Fear-Setting, by Tim Ferris</a></h2><p>Here’s how Tim describes it:</p><p>I do an exercise called “fear-setting” at least once a quarter, often once a month. It is the most powerful exercise I do. Fear-setting has produced my biggest business and personal successes, as well as repeatedly helped me to avoid catastrophic mistakes.</p><p>If you are nervous about making the jump or simply putting it off out of fear of the unknown, here is your antidote. Write down your answers, and keep in mind that thinking a lot will not prove as fruitful or as prolific as simply brain vomiting on the page. Write and do not edit—aim for volume. Spend a few minutes on each answer.</p><ol><li>Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering. What doubt, fears, and “what-ifs” pop up as you consider the big changes you can—or need—to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1–10? Are these things really permanent? How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen?</li><li>What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily? Chances are, it’s easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under control?</li><li>What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? Now that you’ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external? What would the impact of these more likely outcomes be on a scale of 1–10? How likely is it that you could produce at least a moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done this before and pulled it off?</li><li>If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1–3 above. If you quit your job to test other options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to?</li><li>What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it. I’ll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and famous business people for advice.</li><li>What is it costing …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1602523706766" id="item-5f8491cd13e290350fb22d87"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-131cb583c4d6196dd9ed"><div><p><em>Note: “Generally speaking” should be placed in front of basically every sentence in this post. These conclusions are completely based on my own subjective experiences of working in Silicon Valley for 3 years, running a startup for 2 and freelancing for 5.</em></p><p>I get brought into a lot of projects where the engineering team had created user flows and user interfaces, then either pre launch through user testing or post launch through user feedback, the client discovered those designs were far too complex for their end users. So why do those engineers suck at design? They’re far smarter than me, they understand their domain much better than me, and they’ve been working on that specific problem for many months or years. In fact, it’s so rare for a good engineer to be a great UX designer that they're called ‘unicorns’.</p><p>One of the more obvious reasons is that because they’ve been working on the specific problem for so long they have blinders on, and can no longer view it from a 30,000 ft view. There might be emotional attachment to already existing solutions that were thought up months ago. But the reason I wanna mainly talk about is that engineers, developers, whatever you want to call them, function in a different way than the general population, who tend to be the end users. When engineers are developing products strictly for other engineers, like a Chrome extension for debugging code or some sort of command line tool for example, their UX is fantastic. This is where the idea of building something for yourself comes from. So that means they don’t actually suck at design.</p><p>But when they have to design something for someone whose mind doesn’t work like an engineer, it’s a different story. They feel like things are getting “dumbed down” too much, and that “obviously this makes sense”, when for their end user it does not. There is too much of a disconnect between their understanding and mental framework of technology compared with the common person, and a larger amount of empathy is needed to bridge that gap. And that amount of empathy is hard to fake. I imagine that it’s like when you’re trying to explain something technologically mundane in your world, say, Instagram Stories, to your grandma who can barely send email. Bridging that gap requires a larger amount of empathy and patience, not because your grandma is dumb, but because her mental framework of technology is quite different than yours.</p><p>So why is it that UX designers supposedly have the ability to bridge that gap with everyone? I think great UX designers just grew up naturally having much more empathy towards others and having a much better ability to place themselves in others shoes and see the world from their eyes. I would argue that generally speaking in the real world this is a burden, when others can’t empathize with you but all you can do is empathize with them… makes it really difficult to not take on other’s pain, to not be the one who bends their rules to accommodate others, to not have solid boundaries, to not be as defensive in arguments. But in the technology world, that allows for great user friendly designs.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">AWS CloudFront</a> is a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) that gives developers extensive controls over their frontends. CloudFront comes with many configuration options for controlling caching, dynamic origins, geographic restrictions, and much more. But the greatest control that CloudFront offers comes from a service called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/">Lambda@Edge</a>. </p><p>With Lambda@Edge, you can run serverless functions through AWS Lambda on any of four event hooks that happen during a request for our origin content. These functions run at the edge locations of the CDN, meaning that Lambda@Edge promises a way to have a multi-region active-active backend where you only pay for the compute time that you use.</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/5OL4rRqx7pi05JnCYDNt8g/756bfb4b66a5ec4fdf521161b646060f/cloudfront-events-that-trigger-lambda-functions.png" alt="XKCD: Compiling"></p><figcaption>Lambda@Edge hooks (Image via Amazon AWS)</figcaption></div><p>That sounds wonderful, but implementing these functions in practice can be challenging and error-prone. Terraform makes provisioning most cloud infrastructure a breeze, but Lambda functions have a number of challenges with them. </p><p>In a typical modern codebase, a tool like Terraform will manage infrastructure only, while your CI/CD pipeline deploys the application code. But Lambda functions blur those lines, being a serverless service that integrates with other pieces of infrastructure, while itself containing application code.</p><p><strong>This blog post aims to show that not only are making Lambda@Edge functions in Terraform possible, but that it can actually be a pleasant experience.</strong></p><p>At Transcend, these functions have enabled us to create consistently secure frontends without needing to update our frontend application code at all, which has been a wonderful experience.</p><p><em>Pro tip: If you want to host a frontend in AWS, CloudFront with an S3 origin is the recommended method. And if you want to get started with setting up a frontend with Terraform, <a href="https://transcend.io/blog/hassle-free-frontends-in-aws">check out our recent blog post on how to do so</a>.</em></p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>For the purposes of this tutorial, let’s assume we have a very basic frontend that we’d like to deploy. And as a security-conscious organization, we’d like to add a Lambda@Edge function to ensure we are properly setting security headers (such as a Content Security Policy) in our responses.</p><p>To begin with, let’s start with a Terraform file that declares a frontend on AWS using S3 and Cloudfront.

			<p>Your car sits idle over <a href="http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html">95% of the time</a>.</p>
<p>Your guest bedroom is occupied&nbsp;one week out of every 52.</p>
<p>Your kids use the yard less than <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/10/04/backyards-overrated-outdoors-indoors/1613815/">40 minutes a week</a>.</p>
<p>Yet we consumers love to envision the maximum usage for a particular item – like a house or a car – then buy the item with a capacity high enough to accommodate our visions.&nbsp;It makes us feel prepared, it feeds our egos, and it feels as though we got more value for our money than if we’d bought something smaller.</p>
<p>We do this despite knowing that we won’t be boarding&nbsp;guests year ’round, driving groups of eight&nbsp;in our minivan, and hosting lavish backyard parties, nightly.</p>
<p>But rather than buy for peak usage, I prefer to stay flexible.</p>
<div id="attachment_810"><p><a href="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160415_152650new.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-810" src="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160415_152650new-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160415_152650new-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160415_152650new-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-810">The kids in front of the Modo minivan we book every couple weeks or so. Just $8 an hour!</p></div>
<p>I scale my solutions up and down in response to my needs at the time.</p>
<p>Friends visiting from out of town? I’ll pay for their hotel, so I can live in a smaller, cheaper, better located condo for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>I have to schlep a bunch of kids far away? I’ll get a <a href="http://modo.coop/">Modo minivan</a>, a local car share, for a few hours. Let someone else maintain that gorgeous van.</p>
<p>Need some outdoors time? Walk a couple blocks to a park. I’m not interested in mowing something I only use a couple hours a week.</p>
<p>When I tell people this, they&nbsp;usually&nbsp;recoil at the cost. “Hotels are expensive!” “You RENT a car?!” They see only the short term price&nbsp;of my solutions.</p>
<p>They don’t see the other 95% of the time. The time when I didn’t need and therefore didn’t own or maintain those items.&nbsp;It’s in that 95% that I rack up huge savings. I make that 95% work <em>for me</em>, not against me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they’re living further out to afford that guest bedroom and yard, driving the $50,000 8-seater minivan, and paying for 5% usage,&nbsp;100% of the time.</p>
<div id="attachment_796"><p><a href="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160327_114527-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-796" src="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160327_114527-1-1024x766.jpg" alt="Being car-free, we're more likely to opt for active transportation modes - like biking.

But we can scale up to vehicles when needed too.</p></div>
<p>Not owning the high capacity solution also gives me huge flexibility. Do I need a two-seater car? Or a five-seater? Minivan, cargo van, sports car? I can access them all, only when I need them.</p>
<p>So what motivates&nbsp;people to plan for occasional peaks and idealized usage, rather than actual daily utilization?</p>
<p>Ego is part of it. A large SUV or huge house is still a sign of success to many. Your neighbours won’t congratulate you in your driveway for scaling up and&nbsp;down your transportation needs in a responsible, real-time fashion.</p>
<div id="attachment_797"><p><a href="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160406_073653.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-797" src="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160406_073653-1024x768.jpg" alt="For daily kid hauling, nothing beats the bus for price, independence and level of engagement." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160406_073653-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160406_073653-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-797">For daily kid hauling, nothing beats the bus for price, independence and level of engagement.</p></div>
<p>A mistaken sense of “value” is also at play. We’re often taught that “more is more,” up-selling ourselves to a larger house or car on the premise of “just in case.” It’s something we’ve all been guilty of at one time or another.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;next time a big decision comes up, try forgoing your ego and asking yourself if more really means more. Account for the hidden costs: longer commutes to a big house, higher&nbsp;expenses, more maintenance, etc. Try making a rational, needs-based decision. A decision&nbsp;based not on anticipated peaks, but on actual&nbsp;daily usage.</p>
<p><strong>In short, don’t pay for the 95% you won’t use.</strong></p>
<p>You’ll save a ton of money and gain a better quality of life.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Through work I have to deal with a pretty huge codebase, and run Pylint on it during our continuous integration process. It's always been a bit slow, but recently I also noticed that it was consuming a <em>lot</em> of memory, causing OOM failures if we tried to run it too much in parallel.</p>
<p>I decided to roll up my sleeves and figure out:</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly was consuming so much memory?</li>
<li>Is there a way to avoid doing this?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a log of how I went about these two questions, as future reference for when I do other profiling work in Python.</p>
<p>Looking at Pylint from the entrypoint(<code>pylint/__main__.py</code>), I end up digging downwards and finding the "quintessential" <code>for</code> loop that you would expect in a program that checks a bunch of files for errors:</p>
<pre><code>    def _check_files(self, get_ast, file_descrs):
            # in pylint/lint/pylinter.py
            with self._astroid_module_checker() as check_astroid_module:
                for name, filepath, modname in file_descrs:
                    self._check_file(get_ast, check_astroid_module, name, filepath, modname)
</code></pre>
<p>First I just threw in a <code>print("HI")</code> statement in there to confirm that this is indeed what's being run when I do <code>pylint my_code</code>, and that goes off without a hitch.</p>
<p>First is to try and figure out what's being held in memory, so I do a really basic "heap dump" with heapy to see if anything stands out</p>
<pre><code>        from guppy import hpy
        hp = hpy()
        i = 0
        for name, filepath, modname in file_descrs:
            self._check_file(get_ast, check_astroid_module, name, filepath, modname)
            i += 1
            if i % 10 == 0:
                print("HEAP")
                print(hp.heap())
            if i == 100:
                raise ValueError("Done")
</code></pre>
<p>My heap profiles end up being almost entirely "frame types" (which I was kind of expecting, for some reason), but also holding ont a bunch of tracebacks. Enough of these kinds of objects that I told myself "surely this is more than is needed".</p>
<pre><code>    Partition of a set of 2751394 objects. Total size = 436618350 bytes.
    Index  Count   %     Size   % Cumulative  % Kind (class / dict of class)
        0 429084  16 220007072  50 220007072  50 types.FrameType
        1 535810  19 30005360   7 250012432  57 types.TracebackType
        2 516282  19 29719488   7 279731920  64 tuple
        3 101904   4 29004928   7 308736848  71 set
        4 185568   7 21556360   5 330293208  76 dict (no owner)
        5 206170   7 16304240   4 346597448  79 list
        6 117531   4  9998322   2 356595770  82 str
        7  38582   1  9661040   2 366256810  84 dict of astroid.node_classes.Name
        8  76755   3  6754440   2 373011250  85 tokenize.TokenInfo
</code></pre>
<p>It's at this point that I discovered heapy's <a href="https://zhuyifei1999.github.io/guppy3/pbscreen.jpg">Profile Browser</a>, which seemed like a bit of a nicer way to look at this data</p>
<p>I switched up the heap mechanism to dump to a file every 10 iterations, then graph the entire runtime behaviour</p>
<pre><code>    for name, filepath, modname in file_descrs:
        self._check_file(get_ast, check_astroid_module, name, filepath, modname)
        i += 1
        if i % 10 == 0:
            hp.heap().stat.dump("/tmp/linting.stats")
        if i == 100:
            hp.pb("/tmp/linting.stats")
            raise ValueError("Done")
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following result, confirming that frames and tracebacks are a big deal in this run of Pylint:</p>
<p><a href="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/browser-profile-1.png">
  <img src="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/browser-profile-1.png">
</a></p>
<p>My next step is to actually look at the frame objects. Because Python is reference coutned, things are held in memory because <em>something</em> is pointing at them, so I'm going to try and find out which one.</p>
<p>The wonderful <code>objgraph</code> library takes advantage of the Python memory manager to let you look at all objects still in memory, as well as lookup references to an object.</p>
<p>It's actually very amazing that you can do this. Just have an object reference and you can find everything <em>pointing towards</em> that reference (there's some asterisks around C extensions but close enough). This is just wonderful technology for debugging, and another thing that makes Python a joy to work with, thanks to how much of CPython's internals are exposed for these kinds of tools.</p>
<p>First I struggled to find objects because <code>objgraph.by_type('types.TracebackType')</code> wasn't finding any objects, despite me having records of having half a million of them. Turns out the name to use was <code>traceback</code>. Didn't quite nail down why...</p>
<p><code>random.choice(objgraph.by_type('traceback'))</code></p>
<p>Gives me a "random traceback". <code>objgraph.show_backrefs</code> will draw a graph of objects referencing this traceback. </p>
<p>So I put an <code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</code> into the for loop after 100 iterations instead of just raising an exception, and I started looking at random tracebacks </p>
<pre><code>def exclude(obj):
    return 'Pdb' in str(type(obj))

def f(depth=7):
    objgraph.show_backrefs([random.choice(objgraph.by_type('traceback'))],
                            max_depth=depth,
                            filter=lambda elt: not exclude(elt))
</code></pre>
<p>Originally I was just seeing a chain of tracebacks, so I went for a depth of 100 and....</p>

  So a bunch of tracebacks referencing other tracebacks. Cool. So many of them were like this.</p>
<p>I ended up just trying a bunch and failing, so I went after a secondary target: the <code>frame</code> types. These also seemed suspicious to me, and whatI end up finding is something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-nest.png">
 <img src="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-nest.png">
 </a></p>
<p>So tracebacks are holding onto frames (hence some similar cardinality). It's all a big mess, but the frames were at least pointing to lines of code. And this made me realize something silly: <em>I had never bothered to actually look at the data using up so much memory</em>. I totally should have just looked at the traceback objects themselves.</p>
<p>So for this I ended up doing this in the most convoluted way possible, which is look at the addresses in the <code>objgraph</code> image dump, seeing the memory addresses, searching the web for "how do I get a Python object from its address" and ending up finding the neat trick that I had noted:</p>
<pre><code>ipdb&gt; import ctypes
ipdb&gt; ctypes.cast(0x7f187d22b880, ctypes.py_object)
py_object(&lt;traceback object at 0x7f187d22b880&gt;)
ipdb&gt; ctypes.cast(0x7f187d22b880, ctypes.py_object).value
&lt;traceback object at 0x7f187d22b880&gt;
ipdb&gt; my_tb = ctypes.cast(0x7f187d22b880, ctypes.py_object).value
ipdb&gt; traceback.print_tb(my_tb, limit=20)
</code></pre>
<p>You can just tell Python "hey look at this memory, it's definitely at least a python object" and it will work.</p>
<p>Later I realized I had references to these objects through <code>objgraph</code> and could just use that.</p>
<p>It looks like Astroid is building up tracebacks through exception handling code a bit all over the place. I feel like most "cool tricks" are gotten to by forgetting about the easy way to do something, so I won't complain too much.</p>
<p>The traceback itself had a bunch of lines going through Astroid, the AST parser backing Pylint. Progress! Astroid does seem like a program that might hold onto a lot of stuff in memory as its parsing files.</p>
<p>I look around and end up seeing the following line in <code>astroid/manager.py</code></p>
<pre><code>except Exception as ex:
    raise exceptions.AstroidImportError(
    "Loading {modname} failed with:\n{error}",
    modname=modname,
    path=found_spec.location,
) from ex
</code></pre>
<p>"Aha!" Itell myself. This is what I'm lookign for! Some sort of exception chain that would generate super long tracebacks. Plus it's file parsing so there's reccursion, etc... <code>raise thing from other_thing</code> would chain them together!</p>
<p>I remove this <code>from ex</code> and .... nothing. Memory usage is still basically the same, and the tracebacks are still here.</p>
<p>I remember that exceptions hold their local bindings in the tracebacks, so the <code>ex</code> is still accessible. It can't be garbage colleceted just yet! </p>
<p>I do a bunch of refactorings to try and remove the <code>except</code> block for the most part, at least to avoid the reference to <code>ex</code>. Again, nothing!</p>
<p>For the life of me I can't get these tracebacks to garbage collect, despite there being no references to them. At least I thought this was the remaining reference.</p>
<p>Really though, this was all a red herring. I don't know if this actually had anything to do with my memory leak, because at one point I started noticing that <strong>I had no evidence</strong> backing up this entire exception chaining theory. Just a bunch of hunches, plus half a million tracebacks. </p>
<p>I started just kind of randomly looking at tracebacks looking for any extra clues. I tried going up the chain of references by hand but was getting nowhere. </p>
<p>Then I had the revelation: these tracebacks are all stacked on top of each other, but there will be a traceback that is above all these other ones. There is a traceback that doesn't just have another traceback pointing to it! </p>
<p>the references were through the <code>tb_next</code> property, as a simple chain. So I decided to look for the tracebacks at the end of their respective chains:</p>
<p><code>bottom_tbs = [tb for tb in objgraph.by_type('traceback') if tb.tb_next is None]</code></p>
<p>There's something magical about one-lining your way through 500,000 stack traces to find the one you actually care about.</p>
<p>This led me to what I was actually looking for: the reason why Python really wanted to keep these objects around in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-filecache.png">
<img src="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-filecache.png">
</a>
We had a file cache! </p>
<p>Basically Astroid will cache the results of loading a module, so that if some part of the code asks for the same module/file again, it can just provide the previous result. It will also reproduce the errors as well, by holding onto thrown exceptions.</p>
<p>This is where I made a bit of a judgement call. Caching the "error-ness" makes sense, but for me it's not at all worth holding onto the number of tracebacks our code is generating. </p>
<p>Instead I decided to throw away the exception, store a custom <code>Error</code> class, and then just re-building exceptions when they are asked for. The details can be found over at <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/pull/837">this PR</a>, though it's not super interesting.</p>
<p>The end result: we went from 500MB memory usage to 100MB for the codebase I was working against</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler">Way Cooler</a> is a Wayland compositor
that was written in Rust using <a href="https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc">wlc</a>. Since
<a href="https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/516">last April</a> I’ve been
rewriting it to use <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>. In order to do
that however I had to wrap the library so that it could be used in Rust. I
worked on <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs">wlroots-rs</a> and put Way Cooler
on the back burner for a long time. After over 1,000 commits I’m giving up on it.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-wlroots-rs-in-detail">Problems with wlroots-rs in detail</h2>

<h3 id="ownership-with-handles">Ownership with handles</h3>

<p>wlroots-rs was going to be the safe Rust wrapper for the very complicated
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots library</a>. wlroots implements large
parts of a Wayland compositor and provides pluggable modules that most
compositors will want.</p>

<p>The biggest problem when wrapping wlroots was defining the ownership model of
the objects that wlroots exposes. To demonstrate this I will focus on a single
resource that illustrates the problem: an output.</p>

<p>A Wayland “output” is the resource that represents a display device. Commonly
this means it handles a computer monitor. This resource could disappear at any
time in the life cycle of the application. This is easy enough to imagine: all
it takes is a yank of the display’s power cord and the monitor goes away. This
is basically the exact opposite of the Rust memory model. Rust likes to own
things and give compile-time defined borrows of that memory. This is runtime
lifetime management that must be managed in some way.</p>

<p>You cannot simply define it like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Output</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>output_c_ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>wlr_output</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Output</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Forward all the calls to the c pointer</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this was done then it would be possible to leak the memory using <code>Box::leak</code>
and say that an output will live forever – even though it can’t.</p>

<p>The simplest way to achieve this safely would be to use reference counted
pointers and expose only weak pointers. Here is a (fake) example of how this
could look:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// This is a _very_ simple example for clarity.</span>
<span>// wlroots-rs is not implemented like this.</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>RealOutput</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lifeline</span><span>:</span> <span>Rc</span><span>&lt;*</span><span>mut</span> <span>wlr_output</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Output</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lifeline</span><span>:</span> <span>Weak</span><span>&lt;*</span><span>mut</span> <span>wlr_output</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Output</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>/// Changes the mode (resolution) of an output.</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>change_mode</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>Mode</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>output_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>lifeline</span><span>.upgrade</span><span>()</span><span>.ok_or</span><span>(())</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
            <span>wlr_output_change_mode</span><span>(</span><span>output_ptr</span><span>,</span> <span>mode</span><span>.into</span><span>());</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This naive style implementation could work, however it would cause a lot of
branching code. Each call to wlroots will require a check to see if the handle
has been dropped, even though it almost certainly has not been dropped (it can
only be dropped between event callbacks, wlroots/Wayland is callback based).
This means there will be unnecessary paths (that are hopefully marked cold) that
either panic or return an error.</p>

<p>This is obviously not wanted so the next best thing is define a range where it
is safe to use the reference to the resource: i.e. we want to be able to define
a lifetime for a code block. This leads us to the <em>actual</em> design of wlroots-rs,
using handles (note that this <em>is</em> actual code):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// A non-owned reference counted handle to a resource.</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// The resource could be destroyed at any time, it depends on the resource.</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// For example an output is destroyed when its physical output is</span>
<span>/// "disconnected" on DRM. "disconnected" depends on the output (e.g. sometimes</span>
<span>/// turning it off counts as "disconnected").</span>
<span>/// However, when the backend is instead headless an output lives until it is</span>
<span>/// destroyed explicitly by the library user.</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// Some resources are completely controlled by the user. For example although</span>
<span>/// you refer to a `Seat` with handles it is only destroyed when you call the</span>
<span>/// special destroy method on the seat handle.</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// Please refer to the specific resource documentation for a description of</span>
<span>/// the lifetime particular to that resource.</span>

<p>The full implementation can be found
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs/blob/91a18bd541a6ec565d6ef78d18ee5cc6a413f684/src/utils/handle.rs">here</a>,
its far too long and complicated to paste into a blog post.</p>

<p>This code is very complicated, which isn’t what you want for the defining
abstraction of your safe library. As far as I’m aware though it is correct. It’s
also incredibly ugly to use in practice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>some_wlroots_callback</span><span>(</span><span>output_handle</span><span>:</span> <span>OutputHandle</span><span>,</span>
                         <span>surface_handle</span><span>:</span> <span>SurfaceHandle</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>output_handle</span><span>.run</span><span>(|</span><span>output</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>surface_handle</span><span>.run</span><span>(|</span><span>surface</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>// maybe some more nested layers...</span>
        <span>})</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span>
    <span>})</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To avoid this callback hell, I defined two macros to help: <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs/blob/91a18bd541a6ec565d6ef78d18ee5cc6a413f684/src/macros.rs#L355">one normal
macro</a>
and a very complicated <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs/blob/91a18bd541a6ec565d6ef78d18ee5cc6a413f684/wlroots-dehandle/src/lib.rs">procedural
macro</a>.
Here’s what the procedural macro looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// This does the same thing as the above code, but nicer.</span>
<span>#[wlroots_dehandle]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>some_wlroots_callback</span><span>(</span><span>output_handle</span><span>:</span> <span>OutputHandle</span><span>,</span>
                         <span>surface_handle</span><span>:</span> <span>SurfaceHandle</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[dehandle]</span> <span>let</span> <span>output</span> <span>=</span> <span>output</span><span>;</span>
    <span>#[dehandle]</span> <span>let</span> <span>surface</span> <span>=</span> <span>surface_handle</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This expands out the lines to use the non-proc macro, which in turn becomes the
callback hell mess. The only problem with this scheme is now that the control
flow is all wrong:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// this is actual code I had to write (simplified)</span>
<span>for</span> <span>shell</span> <span>in</span> <span>mapped_shells</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[dehandle]</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>surface</span> <span>=</span> <span>shell</span><span>.surface</span><span>();</span>
    <span>// If not ready to render, don't render it yet</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>!</span><span>surface</span><span>.is_mapped</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// What we _want_ to write</span>

<p>So this solution “works” but it’s not great. Ultimately it’s very confusing for
users. It was too confusing for <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/end-of-year-librem-5-update/">purism to get
working</a> (this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX5yVyLbLZE">video</a> was very painful for me to
watch - the library was unusable). <a href="https://github.com/buffet/kiwmi">Kiwmi</a>
initially tried using wlroots-rs but swiftly gave up and used wlroots itself.</p>

<h3 id="the-sheer-amount-of-api-to-wrap">The sheer amount of API to wrap</h3>

<p>Currently there is 11 <strong>THOUSAND</strong> lines of Rust in wlroots-rs. <em>All</em> of this
code is just wrapper code, it doesn’t do anything but memory management. This
isn’t just repeated code either, I defined a <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs/blob/91a18bd541a6ec565d6ef78d18ee5cc6a413f684/src/macros.rs#L201">very complicated and ugly
macro</a>
to try to make it easier.</p>

<p>This wrapper code doesn’t cover even half of the API surface of wlroots. It’s
exhausting writing wlroots-rs code, memory management is constantly on my mind
because that’s the whole purpose of the library. It’s a very boring problem and
it’s always at odds with usability - see the motivation for the escape from
callback hell described above.</p>

<p>To do all of this, and then go write Way Cooler, already a big undertaking, is too
much for me to commit to. When the benefit at the end of the day is just so I
don’t have to write C, that doesn’t really make it worth it. If I got this out
of the box by simply linking to the library, like I can in C++, then it would be
much more tenable.</p>

<p>I can always just use unsafe bindings to wlroots, just like I would with any
other language. However, the <em>entire point</em> of Rust is that it’s safe. Doing
that is not an option because at that point you lose the entire …</p></section></div></article></div></div></div>

<figcaption>"Competition with Windows and macOS makes Linux a better operating system."</figcaption></figure><p>The reasons I do not think Windows will be rebasing to a Linux kernel are as followed:</p><ol><li>The NT kernel in Windows offers a degree of backward compatibility, long-term support, and driver availability that Linux is just now approaching. It would cost millions of dollars to replicate these in Linux. Microsoft has plenty of paying customers to continue supporting Windows as-is, some for decades. Windows is not a drain on Microsoft that would justify the expense of rebasing to Linux for savings, as <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764">Raymond</a> has argued. <a href="https://www.arcanoae.com/">Lots</a> of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11/">profitable</a> <a href="https://vmssoftware.com/">companies</a> <a href="https://www.xinuos.com/">exist</a> solely to service existing operating systems. Even if it came down to rebasing to Linux, it could result in an undesirable kernel monoculture. Competition with Windows and macOS makes Linux a better operating system. The more desirable outcome is that open source innovation continues spreading across and between <em>all</em> operating systems. That Windows and Linux open source contributors share the best of both ecosystems.</li><li>It is unclear if the Windows user space could even be rebased from NT to the Linux kernel and maintain the compatibility that Windows is known for, specifically what enterprise clients with mission-critical applications are paying to get. Windows does not have the same strict division between kernel space and user space that Linux does. The NT kernel has about 400 documented syscalls plus about 1700 documented Win32 API calls. That would be a huge amount of re-implementation to ensure precise compatibility that Windows developers and their tools expect. It goes beyond contributing some fixes to Wine. Linux only has 313 syscalls on amd64 and, even then, part of the reason Microsoft switched from a syscall translation layer in WSL 1 to a virtualized kernel in WSL 2 is because re-implementing the dozens of non-standard ways developers had come to exploit the Linux ABI was <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/4022">a pain in the ass</a>. It is one thing to provide a NT-related compatibility layer for <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2016/12/16/sql-server-on-linux-how-introduction/">SQL Server on Linux</a>, which Microsoft owns, it is another to guarantee it for millions of other developer's applications.</li><li>Microsoft has doubled down on Windows in recent years. Microsoft has invested in usability, new features, and performance improvements for Windows 10 that have paid off. These improvements, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/what-are-microsoft-precision-touchpad-drivers">collaborations with OEMs</a>, and the Surface <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/01/29/traditional-pcs-seeing-resurgence-after-7-years-of-decline.aspx">helped revitalize</a> a PC market that at one point <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/03/06/apple-google-microsoft-hewlett-packard-dell-ipad-iphone-android-ios-samsung-galaxy/1946325/">looked in danger of falling</a> to iPads and Chromebooks. Microsoft has been working hard to make Windows an excellent development platform, with projects like Windows Terminal, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">PowerToys</a>, Windows Subsystem for Linux, and Visual Studio 2019. The Insiders program is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-weve-got-10-million-insiders-testing-windows-10-to-keep-bugs-at-bay/">remarkably successful</a>. Windows powers most of the Surface device lineup, a key focus of Microsoft right now. Internal reorganizations in 2018 and <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/microsoft-brings-windows-ux-surface-teams-together-exec-panos-panay-latest-reorg/">2020</a> show that the future of the Surface and Windows are now inextricably linked. Windows powers the Xbox and we are in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-state-of-pc-gaming-in-2020/">resurgence</a> of mostly Windows-based PC gaming. Microsoft also has ideas for <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10x">Windows 10X</a>, the next operating system concept following Windows 10 (that I think we will <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10x-out-box-experienced-shown-leaked-video">get in gradual pieces</a>), with future hardware like the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-confirms-its-dual-screen-surface-neo-has-been-delayed">Surface Neo</a> in mind.</li><li>Microsoft does not have to rebase to Linux to stay relevant. Microsoft is aware of a changing device landscape after losing on Windows in mobile. They recognize a more diverse set of operating systems and platforms are powering the computing devices we use, which now includes Android, Ubuntu, iOS, macOS, Alexa, Chrome OS, and not just x86 but ARM. Microsoft has shown they are able to adapt by making relevant products and services available on those other platforms while simultaneously keeping their own platform, Windows, competitive in its traditional footholds. Microsoft is now driving innovation on Android in the mobile space, not just with ported Office apps, but a home screen launcher, and now the Surface Duo. On Ubuntu, they offer their tools that would make sense for Linux workstations, such as Code, .NET, Azure tools, Teams, PowerShell, Sysinternals for Linux, and soon Edge, which comes with Microsoft's custom <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide">web dev tools</a>. Do you want to run Ubuntu on Azure? Microsoft has you covered and works closely with Canonical to make that a wonderful experience. </li></ol><p>The much more interesting question is not whether Microsoft is planning to rebase Windows to Linux, but how far Windows will go on open source. We are already seeing components like <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal">Windows Terminal</a>, PowerToys, and other Windows <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/">components</a> either begin life as or go open source. The more logical and realistic goal here is a continued opening of Windows components and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WinDev">Windows development</a> process, even beyond the Insiders program, in a way that benefits other operating systems.</p><p>After all, Windows has already adopted the Ubuntu release cadence, of six-month releases in April and October with set releases getting extended support. Windows 2004 and Ubuntu 20.04 landed within days of each other. I kid.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check out this sneak preview of our work on adding Linux GUI application support to WSL! <a href="https://t.co/lcx4WWwxTo">pic.twitter.com/lcx4WWwxTo</a></p>— Craig Loewen (@craigaloewen) <a href="https://twitter.com/craigaloewen/status/1308452901266751488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Raymond is correct in one key part of his blog. I do think the era of the desktop OS wars is ending. We are entering a new era where your high-end workstation will run multiple operating systems simultaneously, like runtimes, and not necessarily all locally. The choice will not really be Windows or Linux, it will be whether you boot Hyper-V or KVM first, and Windows and Ubuntu stacks will be tuned to run well on the other. Microsoft contributes patches to the Linux kernel to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-these-patches-aim-to-make-linux-run-as-root-partition-on-hyper-v/">run Linux well on Hyper-V</a> and tweaks Windows to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/03/11/windows_10_on_kvm/">play nicely on KVM</a>.</p><p>The best parts of Ubuntu will come to Windows and the best open source parts of Windows will come to Ubuntu, thanks to an increasing trend <a href="https://boxofcables.dev/microsoft-and-open-source-an-unofficial-timeline/">towards open source across Microsoft</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://snapcraft.io/blog/the-windows-calculator-on-linux-with-uno-platform"><div><p>The Windows Calculator on Linux with Uno Platform | Snapcraft</p><p>The good folks in the Uno Platform community have ported the open-source Windows Calculator to Linux.

You’ve only got ten fingers.</p><p>But very few people know <em>why</em> the keyboard is designed that way.

The very first “Type-Writer,” designed by Christopher Sholes 146 years ago, used the exact same QWERTY keyboard that‘s in front of you.</p><p>Here’s how it worked.</p><p>His machine had a mechanism with characters at the end of a bar. When a key was struck, a linkage would swing the bar into a tape coated with ink. And when the character hit the tape, the impression of the character was transferred onto the paper.</p><p>The problem was that bars were colliding with each other and jamming. That’s why Christopher arranged the keys with the most common letters in hard to reach spots. He decided to slow typists down to prevent bars from jamming.</p><p>But that’s excusable. Christopher couldn’t have imagined one-third of humankind using his invention every day for hours. He lived 150 years ago when typing was not even a skill because typewriters didn’t exist.</p><p>And for the next 68 years after the “Type-Writer” hit the market, nobody cared about the speed.</p><p>But then one American professor tried to go faster.</p><h2 id="why-dvorak-keyboard-failed-despite-being-more-efficient"><strong><strong>Why Dvorak keyboard failed despite being more efficient</strong></strong></h2><p>By the 1930s, the typewriters started getting traction.</p><p>The Underwood typewriter was selling like hotcakes. They reached 5 million units sold by 1939, and that was just the beginning.</p><p>On May 12th, 1936, August Dvorak and his brother-in-law, William, submitted a patent for a better-designed keyboard that decreased typing errors, advanced typing speed, and lessened typist fatigue.</p><p>Here’s how it looked:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7358b134-c94b-42d2-b51b-ceb79676f87a_1232x723.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>Their idea was to minimize the distance traveled by the fingers. To do that, August placed all the most commonly used letters in the home row—so that your fingers don’t have to move at all to hit these keys.</p><p>August and William also improved how vowels and consonants are located. They put all the vowels to be used by the left hand and made the right hand to manipulate only consonants. This enabled at least 2x speed improvement as there are very few words in the English language that can be typed with only one hand on the Dvorak keyboard (for the curious, the two are “papaya” and “opaque”).</p><p>Below you can see how much work each of the fingers does when typing on Dvorak instead of QWERTY:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d6b9df3-d665-43a4-bbd7-8cdf5910d6cb_599x409.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>But Dvorak’s keyboard never took off.</p><p>The timing was terrible. Amid the Great Depression, most companies didn’t have the cash to buy new typewriters. And when World War II started, many typewriter plants shut down manufacturing of all typewriters—including ones with Dvorak layouts.</p><p>But the most important reason was psychological.</p><p>Despite Dvorak-trained typists getting banned from typing contests for “unfair advantage,” the QWERTY layout got deep into people’s minds as “normal.” And as soon as something gets “normal,” we forget <em>why</em> we do the thing in the first place.</p><p>I call it the sausage theory.</p><h2 id="the-sausage-theory-of-innovation"><strong>The sausage theory of innovation</strong></h2><p>Here’s how the story goes.</p><p><em>The daughter-in-law is cooking dinner.

When you type a symbol, i.e., “rr” or “wd,” and press a space bar, the system transforms your input into “remember” or “would be” accordingly. You can set up these pairs in Settings/Keyboard/Text Replacement.</p><p>But it’s not only the speed that matters:</p><ul><li><em>Shortcuts work on your iPhone.</em> As you spend 2-4h a day with your iPhone and type at least a few times slower, it’s useful to have shortcuts to speed up your input process.</li><li><em>Shortcuts take care of apostrophes.</em> You can have a “dont” shortcut that turns into “don’t.” This removes the necessity to press the apostrophe key at all.</li><li><em>Shortcuts prevent typos.</em> Typos come from the word type, which means pressing keys one after another. When you do shortcuts, you don’t type. And if you don’t type, then you don’t have typos.</li><li><em>Shortcuts simplify blind typing.</em> Getting all eleven symbols of the word “progressive” right when staring at a screen requires deliberate practice and exceptional motor skills. But if you type two symbols, “pg,” instead of eleven, you will make fewer errors.</li><li><em>Shortcuts let you instantly look up relevant information.</em> If you have an iPad with a keyboard, you can look up stuff from Notes and other apps by pressing Cmd+Space and hitting your shortcut. Here’s how it works:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe06b0035-b3f8-4979-9bc2-9aef3ace58ed_600x450.gif" alt=""></figure><ul><li><em>Shortcuts speed up your handwriting.</em> When you start using shortcuts extensively, you’ll notice that you also use them in handwriting. This happens because you remember the meaning behind the symbol. And as handwriting is even slower than typing on a 146-year-old keyboard, this yields enormous speed benefits compared to scribbling full words and sentences.</li><li><em>Shortcuts speed up your thinking.</em> Inevitably, you will start thinking in shortcuts as well. Thoughts such as “Can I TTS this OL?” (“Can I use my three three screens writing method for this essay outline?”) begin to pop up.</li></ul><p>I can speculate that after three years of using shortcuts every single day for 5-10 hours, my thought process became significantly faster. That’s not only because of smaller symbols but also because shortcuts compress knowledge. They serve as dynamic pointers to the territory in my brain where the meaning is stored.</p><p>This means that I’m climbing up the ladder of information just like a chess player does when he progresses from being an amateur to a grandmaster.</p><p>The between the two is that an amateur calculates moves of individual figures on the board, and the grandmaster can play blind chess with ten people because he operates different information units. The grandmaster thinks not only in combinations and positions but even in entire games.</p><hr><p>Here’s how to integrate shortcuts into your workflow:</p><ul><li><em>Go bottoms-up.</em> Don’t just download 300 most popular English words but make shortcuts based on your unique needs. This means,</li><li><em>Look for big words.</em> You must become the Sherlock of your own typing. Whenever you catch a big word that you type often, go ahead and set up a shortcut for it. The bigger the word, the more benefit you get. For example, you can take the word “progressive” and turn it into a “pg” shortcut. This reduces the number of symbols you need to type 5x and …</li></ul></div></section></article></div></div></div>

            <p>The era of USB-C has come. The other day I threw all other cables into a box, and bought a set of USB-C to USB-C, Lightning, and microUSB cables. USB-C chargers around the house, USB-C PD power bank, even a nice small USB-C dock that works with the Nintendo Switch if the charger can do the right voltage. It's glorious.</p><p>Only one thing won't charge with USB-C, my awfully cheap ($190 for 4GB of RAM) Samsung Chromebook 3, a machine I use when I want the extra security of the Chrome OS platform. Instead, this laptop charges from an old-school 12V barrel connector, forcing me to carry around an extra brick. 😢</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----1.jpeg" alt="side view of the laptop with round charging connector"></figure><p>USB traditionally delivers 5V of power, but with the introduction of the USB Power Delivery standard, devices can negotiate higher voltages with capable power bricks. Indeed, 12V is an option, and at least a couple of my chargers support it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----3.jpeg" alt="USB charger with 12V marking amongst others"></figure><p>It should be possible to hack together a USB-C charger for my cheap Chromebook!</p><p>What we need is called a "USB-C PD trigger", a little board that negotiates a specific PD voltage with a charger. There are a few variants, including ones with a button to select the voltage, but the most common one is a tiny board with a female USB-C connector called ZYPDS.</p><p>They are so cheap that I suspect the reason the laptops don't come with them is that 1) it requires a charger that can deliver that specific voltage, and people are already confused enough by USB-C and 2) the USB-C charger side is probably more expensive.</p><p>They usually support 15V/20V (selected by soldering a bridge), and while I suspect 15V would have worked too, I found one on eBay claiming 9V/12V. It has the same model name, but a different PCB color. Perfect!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-18-at-15.39.38.png" alt="an order for a blue 9V/12V ZYPDS for $4.42"></figure><p>This thing is small enough to fit in a cable (or even in the laptop, but I wanted to keep this as uninvasive as possible) so I also got a short cable with a barrel connector, and some heat shrink tubing.</p><p>When it arrived it was already configured for 12V, and delivered more or less on the spot.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----7.jpeg" alt="multimeter connected to the ZYPDS showing 12.17V"></figure><p>The only tricky thing was figuring out the polarity of the cable and the connector. I learned that the polarity of the connector is the marking on the charger that looks a little like <code>⊖--Ｃ●--⊕</code>, and commonly the outer surface of the barrel is the negative. I figured out which wire connected to the outer surface with the multimeter continuity mode.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----8.jpeg" alt="multimeter connected to the barrel connector and a wire from the cable"></figure><p>A mediocre soldering job later I had a short adaptor from USB-C to a barrel connector.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----9-1.jpeg" alt="ZYPDS with two wires soldered to the connector pads"></figure><p>And it successfully charges the laptop!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----11.jpeg" alt="the adaptor connected to a charging laptop"></figure><p>The only snag was that the barrel connector I got wasn't a perfect fit for the laptop, so it would lose connection if not pulled downwards. Knowing the setup worked, I just cut the stock charger and used its connector instead. It was more annoying to solder because it's a concentric cable, but it works perfectly.</p><p>With the heat shrink tubing on it doesn't even look that bad, and definitely beats carrying an extra charger around! (By the way, heat shrink tubing is amazing.)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----2.jpeg" alt="the adaptor charging a laptop"></figure><p>For more hacks, <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Overloading by argument types is a pretty straightforward feature of many imperative languages.
However, most of them don’t support overloading by return types.
In particular, C++ does not.
For example, <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/ddWcE8">clang complains</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>4</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>functions</span> <span>that</span> <span>differ</span> <span>only</span> <span>in</span> <span>their</span> <span>return</span> <span>type</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>be</span> <span>overloaded</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>~~~~</span> <span>^</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>3</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>previous</span> <span>declaration</span> <span>is</span> <span>here</span>
<span>int</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>~~~</span> <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So… what if I told you we actually <em>can</em> overload by return type in C++?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>By a slight misuse of user-defined conversion operators.</p>

<h2 id="a-proof-of-concept">A Proof-of-Concept</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cast_operator">Conversion operators can be user-defined</a> in C++.
They allow us to add custom implicit or explicit conversion to our types.
These conversions themselves can also be overloaded, which leads us to a simple prototype:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>operator</span> <span>int</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>  <span>// int  from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>bool</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span> <span>// bool from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>"7"</span><span>};</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>"true"</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/z/f3chze">Looking at godbolt</a>, this compiles and calls the desired conversion operators.
An important point to note here is that the compiler needs to know the <em>target</em> type for the conversion.
Thus, <code>auto i = to_string_t{"7"};</code> does not work as intended.
<code>i</code> will be of type <code>to_string_t</code> and not <code>int</code>.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-and-usage">Packaging and Usage</h2>

<p>We can achieve the original goal of an overloaded function by simply returning <code>to_string_t</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>to_string_t</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>s</span><span>};</span> <span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>);</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, one can adhere to <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2013/08/12/gotw-94-solution-aaa-style-almost-always-auto/">almost always auto</a> and write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>));</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>bool</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This technique also works when calling other functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>

<span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"false"</span><span>),</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"0"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And even interacts properly with more complex, potentially templated objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>vec</span><span>;</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>map</span><span>;</span>

<span>vec</span><span>.</span><span>push_back</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"11"</span><span>));</span>
<span>map</span><span>[</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>)]</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>);</span>
<span>vec</span><span>.</span><span>emplace_back</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"5"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/emplace_back"><code>emplace_back</code> is templated</a> and internally constructs an <code>int</code> from our <code>to_string_t</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>if (cond)</code> tries to convert <code>cond</code> to <code>bool</code> and thus also works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>))</span>
    <span>on_true</span><span>();</span>
<span>else</span>
    <span>on_false</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These examples can be seen in action <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/1x5de4">at godbolt</a>.</p>

<h2 id="where-it-doesnt-work">Where It Doesn’t Work</h2>

<p>While we can achieve overloading by return type in many cases using the conversion operator technique, it doesn’t always apply.
As previously mentioned, the compiler needs to know the target type to choose the proper conversion operator and will not convert unless forced to.
We already saw the simplest case where no conversion is applied:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>);</span>
<span>// decltype(i) is to_string_t, not int</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another problematic case arises when paired with normal overloading that leads to ambiguities:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>);</span>

<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which results in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>error:</span> <span>call</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span> <span>is</span> <span>ambiguous</span>
<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
<span>^~~</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>41</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>function</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>42</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>function</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, this means that <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; from_string("2") &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code> does not work.
(The error message for that is slightly ghastly as we have at least 16 candidate overloads.)</p>

<p>Finally, only one user-defined conversion can be applied implicitly, so the following <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Gxq1rb">doesn’t work</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>bar</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>

<span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiler only tries to directly convert <code>to_string_t</code> to <code>bar</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>22</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>no</span> <span>matching</span> <span>function</span> <span>for</span> <span>call</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>test_bar</span><span>'</span>
    <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>));</span>
    <span>^~~~~~~~</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>18</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>function</span> <span>not</span> <span>viable</span><span>:</span> <span>no</span> <span>known</span> <span>conversion</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>to_string_t</span><span>'</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span> <span>for</span> <span>1s</span><span>t</span> <span>argument</span>
<span>void</span> <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All these cases can be resolved by explicitly adding a cast to the desired type, e.g. <code>int(to_string("10"))</code>.</p>

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

<p>One important aspect of normal function overloading in C++ is the extensibility of the overload set.
Independent authors and libraries can add to the same overload set simply by providing a function with the proper name in the same namespace.
We might also add to the overload set via <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl">argument-dependent lookup</a>, though if this should be considered feature or bug is slightly controversial.</p>

<p>In its base form, our conversion operator approach is not extensible.
User-defined conversion functions must be member functions and we cannot add members to other classes post-hoc.
Thus, if our library defines</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>operator</span> <span>int</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>  <span>// int  from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>bool</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span> <span>// bool from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then this means “overload for return types <code>int</code> and <code>bool</code>” and other libraries / files cannot add to that.</p>

<p>There is a way to fix this and add extensibility.
This will add some implementation complexity and for more specialized use cases, extensibility might not actually be desired.
However, I would argue that <code>from_string</code> should be designed with extensibility in mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the rest of this section focuses more on metaprogramming and API design than the return-type overloading.
You can skip to the next section to see the final version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The solution here is that conversion functions can be templated.
We will use that to delegate the conversion to a template specialization, which is then properly extensible:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>always_false</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>"conversion to T not supported"</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>T</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>to_string_t</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>s</span><span>};</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The conversion in <code>to_string_t</code> is now templated and always calls <code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;::from_string(s)</code>.
<code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;</code> is a class template that is specialized for all supported conversions.
Should a non-supported conversion be called, the <a href="https://artificial-mind.net/blog/2020/10/03/always-false"><code>always_false&lt;T&gt;</code> produces a nice(-ish) error message</a>.
We can now add our supported conversions via:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>int</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>bool</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And similarly, other authors or the end user can add conversions for custom types.
Sometimes, it is useful to conditionally add conversions.
For example <code>my_range&lt;T&gt;</code> might only be supported if <code>T</code> itself supports <code>from_string</code>.
Thus, it is customary to add a second template argument to the base template:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>class</span> <span>=</span> <span>void</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>always_false</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>"conversion to T not supported"</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This enables our imaginary end user to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>my_range</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>enable_if_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>has_from_string</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>my_range</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>// e.g. "[1, 2, 3]"</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The partial specialization is only “active”, if <code>T</code> itself satisfies <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code>.
(This, of course, is an example of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">SFINAE</a>).</p>

<p>Such a <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code> might look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>decltype</span><span>(</span>
    <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>declval</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()),</span> 
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>true_type</span><span>{});</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>false_type</span> <span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>);</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>constexpr</span> <span>bool</span> <span>has_from_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>decltype</span><span>(</span><span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span><span>::</span><span>value</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we use <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae#Expression_SFINAE">Expression SFINAE</a> to disable the first <code>impl_has_from_string</code> overload if <code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;::from_string</code> does not exist.
<code>impl_has_from_string</code> itself is overloaded on <code>int</code> and <code>char</code> and called via <code>impl_has_from_string&lt;T&gt;(0)</code>.
This is a cheap way to say “try the <code>int</code> overload first and if it doesn’t apply, take the <code>char</code> overload”.
However, if we try to check <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code> for some type that has no <code>from_string</code>, we trigger the <code>static_assert(always_false&lt;T&gt;);</code> in the base template.
Thus, we move the <code>static_assert</code> to <code>to_string_t::operator T()</code> (see next section).</p>

<p>Note that the templated <code>to_string_impl</code> class is not the only option.
We could also use <a href="https://arne-mertz.de/2016/10/tag-dispatch/">tag dispatch</a> or even normal overloading, e.g. by delegating to (a user-extensible) <code>void convert_to(std::string_view s, T&amp; v)</code> that is overloaded on the second parameter.</p>

Your mad scientist of a boss begins dragging you out of bed by the ankle. He simultaneously explains between belches that the FBI contacted him. They found his recently-developed Szechuan sauce recipe on the dark web. As you careen past the door frame you are able to grab your incident response “Go-Bag”. Inside is your trusty incident thumb drive and laptop.</p>
<p>Resources for getting started will be provided at the <em><span>bottom of the post</span></em>. <em><span>Additionally</span><span>, i</span><span>ndividual articles on working through the artifacts and solving the case will be posted in the coming weeks!</span></em> So be sure to check back soon.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This lab is for learning and practicing forensics obviously! We will also be providing training for free through a series of upcoming posts on how to solve the case!</p>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>Experienced digital forensics Jedi Masters who want a fun case as well as aspiring forensics folks who want to learn and practice.</p>
<p>Teachers, Professors, Mentors, and Students are welcome to use these materials so long as credit is given to this site and its authors.</p>
<h3>Game-isms</h3>
<p>With training in mind, there are intentional (not to mention unintentional) mistakes in the data. Consequently, the timelines are sometimes compressed. For example, the time between the victim’s notification and when someone acquired the images does not make sense in the real world. Likewise, some of the adversary activities are stealthy, funny, or enable training efforts. However, the attack mirrors real-world adversary tactics, techniques, tools, and procedures. Consequently, it will support training and real-world incident preparedness.</p>
<h3>Questions to Answer / Goals</h3>

<li>Finally, when was the last known contact with the adversary?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Advanced and Bonus Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>What CIS Top 20 or SANS Top 20 Controls would have <em>directly </em>prevented this breach?</li>
<li>What major architecture improvement could be made that would have prevented this breach?</li>

<li>Original Contents?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Finally, what file was time stomped?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers for the Stolen Szechuan Sauce are here. A humble recommendation: require that students produce screenshots with their names in a report explaining their findings since the answers are here.</p>
<h3>Client Interview</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/dfirmadness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RickSanchez.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1" alt="Rick Sanchez and The Stolen Szechuan Sauce" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/dfirmadness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RickSanchez.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dfirmadness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RickSanchez.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This interview was conducted while retrieving the artifacts from the system using FTK Imager Lite and a Redline Collector.</p>
<p><strong>Where were the files in question stored?</strong></p>
<p>On the <em>bellllcchhhh</em> File Server on the Domain Controller.</p>
<p><strong>What was the Operating System version of this server?</strong></p>
<p><em>Belch</em> Whatever that idiot Jerry put on there a few years back.</p>
<p><strong>May I have a network map where the affected systems were located?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. All the systems were loc-<em>bellllch</em>-ated in 10.42 something something</p>
<p><strong>Were there any other systems or files you are concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, certainly. Morty is ramble <em>belllch</em> rambling on about something he might have had on there. Also, there was a secret about Be<em>belllech</em> …. Beth on the server. So if you find it, and YOU TELL ANYBODY I WILL KILL YOU!</p>
<p>(The threat here matches a character from a popular cartoon character and not any real threat so stay calm).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This incident occurred at an organization located in Colorado in September. So, this places the incident at UTC -6. Keep this in mind when looking at the output of various tools.</p>

<p><strong>The questions here are not a full example of what to ask during a breach.</strong> It’s part of the training scenario as much as anything else here. It’s also a decent starting point to your investigation would be going through the questions for the exercise and trying to answer those and use them as pivots.</p>
<h3>Potential Questions You May Have</h3>
<p><strong>Why (outdated) Windows 2012?</strong></p>
<p>Its end of life isn’t until 2023 and plenty of people still use it. In fact, investigations reveal that even Windows 2008r2 shows high usage despite an End of Life date of January 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>This will contrast nicely with 2012 for the Memory Forensics as it uses compressed memory. There will also be a difference in Disk Artifacts to explore between the two.</p>
<p><strong>I Don’t Know Forensics! Where do I start?</strong></p>
<p>That’s specifically the point of this training set! We will teach you how to approach this investigation, how to set-up your environment, analyze artifacts, and then to generate a great report!</p>
<h3>The Artifacts</h3>
<p>Separate posts will start appearing soon on how to approach these artifacts, and how to answer the questions above.</p>
<h4>Estimated Difficulty Levels:</h4>
<p><strong>Nightmare</strong> – Disk Image Only</p>
<p><strong>Ultra-Violence</strong> – Disk and Memory</p>
<p><strong>Hurt Me Plenty</strong> – Disk, Memory, and Autoruns</p>
<p><strong>I’m Too Young to Die</strong> – Disk, Memory, Autoruns, and PCAPS.</p>
<p>Also, for a fun twist, try and solve as much of the case as you can without the artifacts from the Desktop.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>To get the E01’s you may need to use Firefox in a Private Window, hit the back button, select the file, and hit Download.</strong></p>
<p>However, if you are worried about storage and bandwidth ditch the <code>protected files</code> and the <code>pagefiles</code> for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re trying to get into game development as a Software Engineer, finding
learning materials with the right level of context can be challenging. You’ll
likely face a choice between following materials introducing you to basic C# and
OOP concepts while also describing Unity concepts, or starting with advanced
tutorials and be left to figure out the core concepts deductively.</p><p>To fill that gap, I’m writing a series called
<strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>. This is
the first piece, and I’ll be releasing additional installments over the next few
weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">make sure to subscribe</a> for updates. The
series is intended for folks already comfortable with programming and software
architecture, especially those who learn best as I do: starting with first
principles and working your way upwards.</p><hr><p>I started my programming journey around 17 years ago by picking up
<a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker</a>. Countless hours spent coding
little games and tools led me to a bigger passion for programming. Eventually, I
was at a point where I focused mainly on Software Engineering. From my peers, I
know this is quite a common path that many of us took to find programming.</p><p>Yet the game development scene has changed significantly from those days. When I
went to pick up Unity after a long absence from game development, I was mostly
interested in understanding the basic concepts: what are the fundamental
building blocks of a game? What do I need to know about how these building
blocks are represented in memory or on disk? How is idiomatic code organized?
What patterns are preferred?</p><p>In the first article in the series, we’ll focus on those first two questions.</p><h2 id="scene">Scenes</h2><p>A <strong>Scene</strong> is the largest unit of organizing your objects in-memory. Scenes
contain the objects making up your game.</p><p>In basic use, one scene represents a <strong>single level</strong> in your game, where one
scene is loaded at any given point. In more “advanced” use, you can have two or
more active scenes at a time. Scenes can be loaded additively and unloaded <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
Having multiple scenes loaded during gameplay comes especially handy when
building a massive world; keeping far-away areas on-disk rather than in-memory
will help you stay within your performance budget.</p><div><figure><p><span>

decide it organizationally makes sense to put all your “environment” (e.g.,
individual pieces that make up a city or village) objects under an empty parent
object. This way, it can be collapsed in the scene view and easily moved
together when building your game.</p><figure><p><span>

avatar, and various UI elements rendered around the player.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Game Object nesting can also have <em>functional significance</em>. For example, a
“Car” can be an object, with code that controls the car’s speed and rotation as
a whole. But individual child objects might represent the four wheels (these
would spin independently), the car body, windows, etc. Moving the parent car
object would move all the child objects, keeping their relative orientation to
the parent (and each other). We might want the player to interact with a door
separately from the rest of the car, for instance.</p><h2 id="component">Components (&amp; MonoBehaviors)</h2><figure><p><span>

    </span></p><figcaption><p>The Warrior object from the previous screenshot is shown above in Unity’s
“Inspector” window. Each illustrated section (e.g., Animator, Rigidbody,
Collider) are <em>Components</em> making up this object.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Every Game Object is comprised of <strong>Components</strong>.</p><p>A Component implements a well-defined set of behaviors for a GameObject to
execute. Everything that makes an object what it is would come from the
components that make it up:</p><ul><li>A single “visible” piece of a car will have a <em>Renderer</em> component that
paints it, and likely a <em>Collider</em> component that sets up its collision
bounds.</li><li>If a car represents the player, the car object itself might have a <em>Player
Input Controller</em> that takes key input events and translates these to code
moving the car around.</li></ul><p>While you can write large and complex Components that correspond 1:1 to an
object (e.g., a player component codes the entire player, while an enemy
component codes the enemy as a whole), it’s typically common to factor out your
logic into streamlined pieces corresponding to individual <em>traits</em>. For example:</p><ul><li>All objects with <em>health</em>, whether a Player or an Enemy, might have a
<code>LivingObject</code> component that sets an initial health value, takes damage,
and triggers a death event once it dies.</li><li>A player might additionally have an input component controlling its
movement, while the enemy might have an AI component that controls its
movement instead.</li></ul><p>Components receive various callbacks throughout their lifetime, known in Unity
as <em>Messages</em>. Examples of Messages include <code>OnEnable</code>/<code>OnDisable</code>, <code>Start</code>,
<code>OnDestroy</code>, <code>Update</code>, and others. If an object implements an <code>Update()</code> method,
this method will automagically be called by Unity in every frame of the game
loop while the object is active, and the given component is enabled. These
methods can be marked <code>private</code>; the Unity engine will still call them.</p><p>Components can also expose public methods as you’d expect. Other components can
take a reference to a component and call these public methods.</p><h2 id="asset">Assets</h2><p><strong>Assets</strong> are the on-disk resources that make up your game project. These
include meshes (models), textures, sprites, sounds, and other resources.</p><p>When serialized to the disk, your scenes are represented as assets made up of
the Game Objects inside of them. We’ll also discuss in the next section how you
can make Game Objects that are reused often into an asset known as a

<em>instances</em> in a scene. But what if a particular class of objects is commonly
repeated? Such objects can be made into a <strong>Prefab</strong>, which is effectively the
object in asset form.</p><p>Instances of a prefab in a scene can have local modifications that distinguish
it (e.g., if a <em>tree</em> object is a prefab, you can have tree instances of
different heights). Instances of a prefab all inherit and override data from
their prefab.</p><h3>Nested Prefabs</h3><p>Starting with Unity 2018.3, Prefabs can be nested just as you expect:</p><ol><li>A parent object with prefab child objects can be a prefab itself. In the
parent prefab, the child prefab instance can have its own modifications. In
the scene, the entire prefab hierarchy is instantiated, and scene-specific
modifications can layer on top.</li><li>A prefab instance in a scene with its own local modifications can be saved as
its own “Prefab Variant” asset. A variant is a prefab asset that inherits
from another prefab, applying additional modifications on top.</li></ol><p>These concepts compose; a prefab variant of a nested prefab, or a prefab variant
of a prefab variant, for instance.</p><h2 id="serialization">Serialization &amp; Deserialization</h2><p>Your project’s assets, scenes, and objects are all persisted on-disk. When
editing your game, these objects are loaded in memory and saved back to disk
using
<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/06/24/serialization-in-unity/">Unity’s serialization system</a>.
When playtesting your game, the objects and scenes in-memory are loaded through
the same serialization system. This system also maps between assets in your
compiled bundle and the loaded/unloaded scene objects in-memory.</p><p>The Unity Engine’s Serialization/Deserialization flow loads on-disk assets into
memory (in your project: for editing/playtesting; in-game, when loading a scene)
and is responsible for saving the state of your edited objects &amp; components back
into their scenes and prefabs.</p><p>Therefore, the serialization system is also at the core of the Unity Editor
experience itself. For a <code>MonoBehavior</code> to take an input on construction when
instantiated in a scene, those fields must be <em>serialized</em>.</p><p>Most core Unity types such as <code>GameObject</code>s, <code>MonoBehavior</code>s, and asset
resources are
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.serializableattribute">Serializable</a>
and can receive initial values on creation from within the Unity Editor. Public
fields on your <code>MonoBehavior</code> are serialized by default (if they’re of a
serializable type), and private fields need to be marked with Unity’s
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SerializeField.html"><code>[SerializeField]</code></a>
attribute to be serialized as well.</p><figure><p><span>
