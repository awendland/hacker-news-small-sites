<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><strong>Today you are frustrated.</strong></p>

<p>This is so annoying. Youâ€™ve written a Rust crate and now that you want to test it for the very first time, <em>it doesnâ€™t work!</em></p>

<p>Come on, Rust! How dare you? You promised that once one gets past the compiler, it.<br>
<em>Just.<br>
<strong>Works!</strong></em><br>
And now this!</p>

<p>Ok, ok. You calm yourself down. Lets start from the beginning. You want to create so called <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/">minidumps</a>. This is a file that contains information about a crashed program (like stacks of all threads, CPU registers, system info, etc.).
The minidump consists of various sections, such as the minidump header (including time of day, versions and basically a table of contents), a thread section (including all threads of the process and their stacks), memory mappings and libraries, etc. [Just to give some context, as all of this is actually not really important.]</p>

<p>For this, you created a <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/minidump_writer_linux">crate</a>. One section gets written after the other, while information about the targeted process is retrieved from the system. You even created a nice, simple API. You hand in a process ID and an open file, where the minidump should be written to. like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>blamed_thread</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>dump_file</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also hand in user specified memory regions that should be included in the dump, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>app_memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>AppMemory</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>some_address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>memory_size</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>pid</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.set_app_memory</span><span>(</span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>app_memory</span><span>])</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>tmpfile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>But when you run your nice library code in an application, you get <code>'Dumping failed: "Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)"'</code>.</p>

<p><em>How useless is that?!</em></p>

<p>Okay, maybe you could enhance your library error handling, a little. And by enhance, you mean â€œimplement one in the first placeâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-dart">State of the dart</h2>

<p>Your current approach is to define</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Error</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Sync</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>result</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and using <code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code> in all of your functions as the return value and handing all of them to the parent function using <code>?</code>. Thus the original error pierces through your callstack like a dart throughâ€¦.jelly (Yes, you are good with words and you know it.).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.read_auxv</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_threads</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_mappings</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Rust parlance, this is also called bubbling up errors.</p>

<p>Usually, you just bubble up errors from libraries you use, but for the rare errors you have to define yourself, you currently just do</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>"Found no auxv entry"</span><span>.into</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, now you know there is an error, at least. And that it has <em>something</em> to do with your usage of <code>ptrace</code>. But you have no idea where that happens. You use that functionality in various places. Is it during the init-phase? During one of the sections? And if so, which one? What are you trying to read? And from where? Or in short: <strong>What is going on?!</strong></p>

<h2 id="shoes-off-get-some-tea-research-time">Shoes off, get some tea: Research time!</h2>

<p>Well, Rust has been around for quite some time now and they always boast about how error handling is a first class citizen and all that. So error handling should be a done deal, right? With a canonical way of dealing with errors, officially documented and all that should be right there, correct?</p>

<p>Oh boy, were you wrong.</p>

<p>Turns out, this is a very active field ofâ€¦mhâ€¦experimentation, lets say. There has been <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/">a survey</a> recently, listing and quickly describing most the different libraries and ways for error handling that emerged, fallen out of favor, got forked, died anyways, got superseded, fallen out of favor again, etc.
And the opinions seem to change frequently, if you should use <code>error-chain</code> or <code>failure</code> or <code>fehler</code> or <code>snafu</code> or <code>thiserror</code> or <code>anyhow</code> or <code>eyre</code> orâ€¦</p>

<p>You opened a can of hornets there, or whatever that saying is.</p>

<p>Then you find <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/11/23/What-the-error-handling-project-group-is-working-on.html">this gem</a> and donâ€™t know if you should laugh or cry. Almost six years after Rust hit 1.0 an error handling project group is formed. Six. Years. <em>(heavy breathing)</em></p>

<p>Well, okay. At least they are sorting it out now. Problem is, you needâ€¦.<em>SIX YEARS? Are you serious?</em>â€¦ahem, sorryâ€¦Problem is, you need helpful error messages now.</p>

<p>After reading a few decent blogs on the topic (like <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-error-handling/">this</a> or <a href="https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/">that</a>), there seems to emerge a consensus, at least for libraries: Return something that derives from <code>std::error::Error</code>. Either implement them by hand, or use a crate that does it for you, using macro magic. like <code>thiserror</code>. Which method you use depends on your level of laziness plus your patience regarding compile times.</p>

<h2 id="examples-vs-reality">Examples vs. Reality</h2>

<p>Another post highlighted <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/wrap_error.html">error wrapping</a>, a particularly intriguing idea to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all the articles have the understandable, but rather annoying tendency to use very simple example code for illustration purposes. Unrealistically simple, you might even say. They have callstacks of depth 1, return only three kinds of error in total in their API, and their errors are obvious and easily describable (e.g. â€œInput file XY not found in your â€˜counting wordsâ€™ programâ€�).</p>

<p>You have a more complicated callstack, with tons of different errors and code reuse in different places. For example, the function you think is to blame for the above error is <code>copy_from_process()</code>, which calls <code>ptrace::read()</code>, which probably returns something like <code>Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)</code>.
This function is used in multiple places in your code, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>â”œâ”€ init()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ read_auxv()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/auxv", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€ enumerate_mappings()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/maps", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€ some_more_checks()
â”‚      â””â”€ copy_from_process()
â”‚
â””â”€ dump()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::header::write()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::thread_list_stream::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::mappings::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ elf_identifier_for_mapping()
   â”‚     â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::app_memory::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â””â”€ ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Same goes for opening files, which happens in multiple places (two examples of which are shown in <code>init()</code>), so getting <code>FileNotFound</code> without context is going to be equally fun, and so on.</p>



<p>Wrapping errors still sounds like a nice idea, but one layer alone is not going to <del>wrap it</del> cut it.
Going with <code>copy_from_process()</code> as an example, you see a few possibilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wrapping the <code>ptrace</code> error into an <code>CopyFromProcessError</code>, but that gives you nothing (except maybe some context, if you add some)</li>
  <li>With <code>InitError</code>s and <code>DumpingError</code>s that wrap the <code>ptrace</code> errors, you will still not know which section failed and why, but know if it was during <code>init()</code> or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might add context to option 2 as well (see below on how), but each section has a variety of reasons why it could fail. Some unique to the section, some shared among a few, some among all of them.</p>

<p>Complex problems sometimes require complex solutions, maybe?</p>

<h2 id="inc-err-ption">Inc <em>Err()</em> ption</h2>

<p>Using <code>thiserror</code> and the fabulous <code>#[from]</code> macro, you quickly define a plethora of errors and wrappers, starting from the deepest, darkest places in your callstack, wrapping your way up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"nix::ptrace() error"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>PtraceError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>nix</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed to copy memory from process"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>CopyFromProcessError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>DumpError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Error during init phase"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>InitError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>InitError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(transparent)]</span>
    <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed when writing section AppMemory"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The fun part is: You have to touch very little of your existing code, thanks to the automatic conversion from one error to the other, conveniently provided by <code>#[from]</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), InitError&gt; {
</span>     self.read_auxv()?;
     self.enumerate_threads()?;
     self.enumerate_mappings()?;
     Ok(())
 }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize)&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize), DumperError&gt; {
</span> // snip

    let mapping = self
        .find_mapping(stack_pointer)
<span>-        .ok_or("No mapping for stack pointer found")?;
</span><span>+        .ok_or(DumperError::NoStackPointerMapping)?;
</span>    let offset = stack_pointer - mapping.start_address;
    let distance_to_end = mapping.size - offset;
  // snip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run your test binary again, you now get</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which isâ€¦.<em>(Throws a stack of papers from the desk)</em>â€¦short. Too short, and not that much more helpful, actually. Well, you know which section is failing. Thats good. But where are all the nice error messages you specified in your errors?</p>

<p>Hm, you do only use <code>println!("{}", error);</code>. Maybe <code>{:?}</code> is better?</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SectionAppMemoryError(CopyFromProcessError(PtraceError(Sys(EIO))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha! Now you are getting somewhere! Tiny, tiny, painfully <strong>tiny</strong> steps, but you are getting somewhere! No error texts, but at least a chain!</p>

<p>Normal printing doesnâ€™t seem to recursively go through all the wrapped errors, but stop at the top most. For this, you need to either go through all the errors yourself by hand, or use a crate that does this for you. There are a number of them that provide this, but <code>anyhow</code> will do (its by the same author as <code>thiserror</code>, so interoperability shouldnâ€™t be an issue).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:#}"</span><span>,</span> <span>anyhow</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>aaaaand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory: Failed to copy memory from process: nix::ptrace() error: EIO: I/O error
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>Let me preface this with an explanation. Over the last few days I read online people saying that Texas' power outages had been caused by Texas being on its own grid… deregulation… Not following national standards…  had Texas been connected to the Eastern Interconnection or the Western Interconnection none of this would have happened. But not one post shows any evidence or requirements that backed up these claims. So, I went looking for proof and instead of finding requirements, I found a nationwide problem with winterization. As an aside I am not an expert in the grid or electricity, I am a software developer, and this is my best interpretation of the requirements I could find.</p>
<p>Let’s start off with how the electrical grid works in the US. The grid is made up of 3 interconnections: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Texas Interconnect. Each of these interconnections operate in (near) isolation with their own frequency, voltage, and phase. There are several high voltage DC interconnects (HVDC or DC-DC) between them. In each of these interconnections there is at least one grid operators, for example ERCOT in Texas. These grid operators manage the generation and load of their interconnection, acting as almost as an electric clearing house. They are also responsible for keeping voltage and frequency within range and directing distributors (like ONCOR in north Texas) to shed load during Electrical Emergency Alerts (EEA). An important thing to note for later, from the best I can tell the different grid operators in the Eastern Interconnect share power in a “non-firm, as-available basis”.</p>
<p>What happened in Texas, starting 12:30 AM February 15. The long and short of it is an estimated 34GW of generation went offline in about 2 hours[1]. Looking at ERCOT’s tweets [2,3,4], generation was starting to have an issue at 00:17:45 and some load needed to be shed so ERCOT issued the first EEA (EEA1). In the February EEA tools document[5] EEA1 can open up around 1.6GW of “peeker” generation and importation from the Eastern and Western Interconnections. But by 1:12:06 that wasn’t enough and additional load had to be shed.  A second EEA was issued (EEA2) shedding another 1.6GW. But just a few minutes later the house came crashing down and at 1:25:40 the third EEA (EEA3) was issued. In addition to starting rolling blackouts to shed most of the load it also allowed for other actions to free .1-.2GW of load.</p>
<p>The 34GW of generation lost was from every fuel source used. Most of it was frozen-off natural gas (gas) wells, some of it was frozen wind turbines, solar panels that had snow on them and even a nuclear plant had to go offline due to issues with feedwater pressure sensing issues related to the cold.
What do the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) standards say about protecting any of these sources? Not much.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the least complex, wind turbines. On September 12, 2012 NERC published a Lesson Learned document in regards to Texas’s issues with some of the wind farms freezing in extreme winter weather[6]. According to the document the event that was predicted over a week beforehand brought 4 days of low temperature, high winds and wind chills, ice and snow that limited the generation facility to just 25% of capacity. The facility did have a SOP for icing conditions that was implemented. However, the facility never defined it’s minimum operating temperature. When lightning knocked out some of the sensing equipment, the turbines had to be stop for safety. The repair crews couldn’t immediately get to the turbines and they had to sit, this gave the oil a chance to cool and partly freeze. When the turbines were returned to service, they tripped back off due to high oil pressure. Eventually after working with the manufacturer they were able to safely heat the oil and restart the turbines. One of the big lessons from this was to install cold weather packs for wind turbines and watch the oil temperature. You’d think that would solve future outage, but no, in 2019 in the midwestwind turbines failed due to exceptionally low temperatures, around -21. Again the cold weather package hadn’t been installed and was one of the root causes of the failure[7].</p>
<p>The nuclear plant’s sensing problems had happened before too. Although it wasn’t a nuclear plant, there are several documented cases on NERC’s website citing cold weather and sensor issues [8,9]. This repeated in Texas (2011) and in the south east (2018)[10].</p>
<p>Let’s discuss natural gas next. It appears that most of the issues in the problematic natural gas fired facilities was due to low gas supplies. In 2012 NERC warned of the interconnectivity of natural gas and electric[11]. Natural gas coming out of the ground has a naturally high water content. This water can freeze the extraction equipment during sub-freezing weather in improperly winterized wells creating what is know as a freeze-off. businesses, residential customers, and powerplants all run off the same supply, once wells start freezing off the supply dwindles for all. Natural gas companies prioritize residential customers as needed and will cut businesses and powerplants. This obviously creates issues in electrical generation.</p>
<p>In this latest case, much of the gas generation loss was due to under pressure conditions at the generation site. When generation sites detect this kind of fault, they are taken offline for safety. Not only is this what happened this year, but it has happened many, many times before</p>
<p>The most resent case I could find was 2018 in the south east[10]. Starting on January 18, 2018 a large area in the south east US experienced unusually cold weather. This caused 183 generation facilities to go offline or operate with greatly reduced output. At the peak there was nearly 30GW of production lost. This caused several grid operators to issue EEAs and begin rolling blackouts. In the “event area” 14% of the failures could be directly attributed to the cold weather. And another 30% could be indirectly linked to weather, including mechanical failures know to happen in cold weather and gas supply issues. NERC found that more than 33% of the failed powerplants didn’t have a winterization plan.</p>
<p>Why didn’t these plants have a winterization plan? Because it wasn’t required[10,12].</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be so bad if this wqs the first time it happened, it wasn’t even the second time it happened. In 2014 a polar vortex hit the US. bringing temperatures well below normal. During this event 55% of the outages were at gas power plants and in all 90GW of generation was lost[13].</p>
<p>The earliest report I could find was from the 2011 winter event in Texas[14]. A very strong cold front hit Texas (and other parts of the south central US) bringing temperatures below freezing for over 4 days and winds over 30 MPH. Leading up to the event, ERCOT and other grid operators in surrounding areas felt that there wouldn’t be a need for rolling blackouts. At the beginning of the event ERCOT had 3.1GW of reserve, nearly 1GW over the minimum required. However, over the next 2 days ERCOT lost nearly 30GW of production in 193 generation facilities. ERCOT was able to stabilize the grid with rolling blackouts and the other EEA methods[5]. Other grids suffered problems as well, EPE (El Paso) and SRP (Arizona) lost nearly 1.4GW due to cold weather. Another issue in ERCOT’s region was nearly 50% of the “black start” facilities were either down for scheduled maintenance or failed on startup. One of the main causes again was the loss of gas during this blackout period. 14.8 Bcf of natural gas production was lost due to freeze-offs, electrical outages (ironically) and customer curtailments. following the previous equivalent storm in 1989, the PUCT (Public Utility Commission of Texas) issued several recommendations and guidelines for winterization of power plants and gas wells. However, due to the infrequency of these storms the implementation lacked. With many of the same facilities that failed in 1989 also failed in 2011.  My guess is these same sites failed again in 2021. Interestingly the NERC found that it is quite possible that gas production in these unusually cold conditions may be impossible.</p>
<p>What has been done since 2011? Not a whole lot. A request for a new standard was issued to NERC in late 2012, however a few months later it was denied.[15] Also in 2012 NERC put out a set of guidelines for developing a plan for winter weather[16]. In 2017 NERC put out a special reliability report on the relationship between gas and electricity[17]. Finally, after the 2018 event NERC received another standard request that was approved[23], however it won’t be finalized until late 2021[18,19,20].</p>
<p>From what I can see, ERCOT has more restrictive rules in their Generator Winter Weatherization Workshop than NERC[21]. All generation stations must have plans for emergencies, address abnormal weather, critical failure points, weather design limits, alternative fuels and testing[21,22]. ERCOT reports that there were 80 spot checks done in the 2019/2020 season with 71 being gas plants and 6 being black start gas plants. 23 had to improve and would be reinspected in early 2021 the rest passed.</p>
<p>The issue of extreme cold weather and electrical outages is a national issue that needs to be addressed. However, after repeated failings it hasn’t really been addressed. Hopefully with the new NERC requirements and the Texas legislature in session progress can be made.</p>

  <div>
<p>Hot on the heels of Gleam v0.13 comes another release, <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.14.0">Gleam v0.14</a>!
As always, let’s take a look at some of the highlights.</p>

<h2 id="dialyzer--erlang-typespecs">Dialyzer &amp; Erlang typespecs</h2>

<p>Many dynamically typed BEAM languages support Erlang’s typespecs, type
annotations that can be analysed with the <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html">Dialyzer</a> tool. While
not as powerful or reliable as Gleam’s type system it can be a useful tool
for finding problems with your Erlang or Elixir code. Dialyzer doesn’t
require typespecs but it can work better if they are added to the code.</p>

<p>Starting with this release Gleam will generate typespecs for all functions
and Erlang type definitions for all declared types within a Gleam program,
giving you one extra tool to help you write robust and reliable code when
using Gleam alongside Elixir or Erlang.</p>

<p>For a quick example, here’s some code in Gleam:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>LinkedList</span><span>(</span><span>element</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Empty</span>
  <span>Node</span><span>(</span><span>element</span><span>,</span> <span>LinkedList</span><span>(</span><span>element</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_empty</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>list</span> <span>==</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span> <span>fun</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>list</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Empty</span>
    <span>Node</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>list</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Node</span><span>(</span><span>fun</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>),</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span> <span>fun</span><span>))</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here’s the Erlang code and typespecs it compiles to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-</span><span>module</span><span>(</span><span>linked_list</span><span>).</span>
<span>-</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>no_auto_import</span><span>).</span>

<span>-</span><span>export</span><span>([</span><span>is_empty</span><span>/</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>map</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>]).</span>
<span>-</span><span>export_type</span><span>([</span><span>linked_list</span><span>/</span><span>1</span><span>]).</span>

<span>-</span><span>type</span> <span>linked_list</span><span>(</span><span>H</span><span>)</span> <span>::</span> <span>empty</span> <span>|</span> <span>{</span><span>node</span><span>,</span> <span>H</span><span>,</span> <span>linked_list</span><span>(</span><span>H</span><span>)}.</span>

<span>-</span><span>spec</span> <span>is_empty</span><span>(</span><span>linked_list</span><span>(</span><span>any</span><span>()))</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>boolean</span><span>().</span>
<span>is_empty</span><span>(</span><span>List</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>List</span> <span>=:=</span> <span>empty</span><span>.</span>

<span>-</span><span>spec</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>linked_list</span><span>(</span><span>R</span><span>),</span> <span>fun</span><span>((</span><span>R</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>U</span><span>))</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>linked_list</span><span>(</span><span>U</span><span>).</span>
<span>map</span><span>(</span><span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Fun</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>List</span> <span>of</span>
        <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span>

    <span>end</span><span>.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No annotations are required at all in your Gleam code to get full typespec
coverage, Gleam’s compiler reuses the type information from its powerful type
inference algorithm to determine the correct typespecs.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://gitlab.com/greggreg">Greg</a> for this brilliant new feature!</p>

<h2 id="erlang-escripts">Erlang escripts</h2>

<p>Erlang projects are unusual in that typically instead of having a <code>main</code>
function as the entrypoint of your application you define a tree of actors to
come online and process items of work while your program is running.</p>

<p>This can be a powerful way to write long-lived services that make use of the
runtime’s fault tolerance features, but it does not lend itself well to
short-lived programs such as command line scripts. It can be confusing to
newcomers from other languages too.</p>

<p>For these short lived programs Erlang <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/escript.html">escripts</a> are typically used.
These are lightweight Erlang programs that have a <code>main</code> function as an entrypoint.</p>

<p>To make it easier to use these from Gleam the <code>gleam new</code> command now has an
escript template that can be used to create an escript project without any
further configuration required.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>gleam new my_script <span>--template</span> escript
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A world class developer experience is a key goal of the Gleam project.
Further tooling improvements are right around the corner!</p>

<h2 id="night-mode">Night mode</h2>

<p>Gleam has the ability to render <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/">HTML documentation</a> 
for your code, ready to upload to Hexdocs.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tynanbe">Tynan Beatty</a> the documentation is
looking better than ever! There’s too many improvements to list but the big
one is they now have a night mode! If you’re a night owl like me I’m sure you
will enjoy the lower contrast dark tones when doing some late evening coding.</p>

<h2 id="better-errors-again">Better errors, again</h2>

<p>At the risk of sounding like a broken record Gleam’s error messages have been
improved yet again. Here’s an example of one of the improvements:</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: Syntax error
    ┌─ /src/thing.gleam:115:18
    │
115 │ pub fn overlappedBy(compare, a, b) -&gt; Bool {
    │                  ^^ I was not expecting this.

Expected one of: "("
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: Syntax error
    ┌─ /src/thing.gleam:115:18
    │
115 │ pub fn overlappedBy(compare, a, b) -&gt; Bool {
    │                  ^^ This is not a valid name.

Hint: Names start with a lowercase letter and contain a-z, 0-9, or _.
Try: overlapped_by
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/samontea">Samuel Mercier</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pd-andy">Andy
Thompson</a> for these.</p>

<h2 id="static-bit-string-validation">Static bit string validation</h2>

<p>Bit string syntax is a feature that Gleam inherits from Erlang. It provides a
way to declartively and concisely construct and manipulate raw bits of data
through literals and pattern matching.</p>

<p>With this Gleam release we apply further static analysis to bit string
literals and patterns used in Gleam programs to catch invalid or incorrect
code.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of one of the errors that may be reported:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /Users/a/parser_test/src/a.gleam:2:20
  │
2 │   &lt;&lt;1:size(1)-unit(0)&gt;&gt;
  │                    ^ This is not a valid BitString unit value.

Hint: unit must be an integer literal &gt;= 1 and &lt;= 256
See: https://gleam.run/book/tour/bit-strings
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://gitlab.com/greggreg">Greg</a> for this bit string safety net.</p>

<h2 id="docker-images">Docker images</h2>

<p>Up until now <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer">Peter Saxton</a> has been very kindly
building Gleam docker images for use in <a href="https://sendmemo.app/">Memo</a> and the
wider community.</p>

<p>With this release he has ported his build automation over to the Gleam repo
so we have automation creation of OCI/Docker images built and published
automatically with each release.</p>

<p>We are building these variants:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>gleam-erlang</code>: Gleam and the Erlang tooling on Ubuntu Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-erlang-slim</code>: Gleam and the Erlang tooling on slim Debian Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-erlang-alpine</code>: Gleam and the Erlang tooling on Alpine Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-elixir</code>: Gleam and the Elixir tooling on Ubuntu Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-elixir-slim</code>: Gleam and the Elixir tooling on slim Debian Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-elixir-alpine</code>: Gleam and the Elixir tooling on Alpine Linux</li>
</ul>

<p>For all the images see the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/gleam-lang/packages/container/package/gleam">Gleam image registry</a>. Thanks Peter!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Our mission is to give everyone in the world <strong>computer superpowers</strong>. We build powerful yet approachable tools &amp; platforms for developers, students, and educators.</p>
<p>We see a new generation of hackers and entrepreneurs rising to seize the power of computers and the internet to create software that empowers them and their communities. They refuse to be programmed by the software priesthood that wants them to endlessly consume ads. Instead, they build a more free society where computers work for and under human users, not the other way around. The world we're describing is coming, and we exist to accelerate the shift.</p>
<p><img src="https://repl.art/replit.png" alt="art"></p>
<p>Replit is a multiplayer computing environment that makes it <a href="https://blog.replit.com/internet-of-fun">fun</a> to learn how to code, build, and <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">share apps</a> with other people. You can create a cloud-powered computer in milliseconds -- we call them "repls" -- and you can create as many of them as you'd like, all for free. Repls come with storage for your code and files, a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">database</a> for your data, and a <a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">multiplayer editor</a> &amp; console to code with your friends. For <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">$7/month</a>, you'll get more powerful machines and, with one-click, make them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/alwayson">run forever</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="db"></p>
<p>When you invite a friend to your repl, you can see them in your editor and talk to them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/annotations-for-education">right in your code</a>. You can make <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/http-servers">web</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/native-graphics-love">desktop</a>, and even command-line apps. Replit takes care of the entire process of <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">publishing and hosting apps</a> so you can focus on your ideas.</p>
<p><img src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Live-Code-Editing.gif?resize=800%2C450&amp;strip=all" alt="multiplayer"></p>
<p>When you've built something you want to share, you can share the <a href="https://blog.replit.com/spotlight">repl URL</a>, and your users can play with your app, react to it, comment on it, and even fork and remix it. Replit gives you a profile to keep and showcase all your apps and repls. You can make <a href="https://repl.it/site/teams">shared team profiles</a> for your class, friends, or company to collaborate on repls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/spotlight/ios-demo.gif" alt="share"></p>
<p>Because you can make a repl in milliseconds, Replit makes it fun and safe to experiment with ideas. Learning comes naturally as a side effect of playing in the Replit ecosystem.</p>
<p>Millions of people have learned how to code with Replit and built great apps with thousands of happy users. Some have even built businesses and become rich &amp; famous.</p>
<p>Replit's design principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learnable yet scalable interfaces</strong>: Interfaces today present the same UI to vastly different users, from children to adults, from novices to experts. Our mission demands that we make computing environments more accessible to novices while making it possible to transition to more powerful interfaces. Replit starts with a simple editor and console, which gets learners very far. The UI, however, is adaptable and presents different faces to different users and use-cases.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure as legos</strong>: A core part of commanding computer power is to be able to build for the modern internet-connected world. Despite progress in cloud computing, infrastructure remains inaccessible to novices, hobbyists, and educators. We change this by designing simple and scalable components, like cloud-hosted servers accessible right from the repl, storage, databases, etc., that require little configuration and maintenance by the programmer. Coders can then mix and match components to create endless possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>People-centric technology</strong>: It's more exciting and fun to create and learn with other people. The future demands that computers and the internet have human interconnectedness as a core primitive. From our multiplayer computing protocol to our community spaces for sharing software, we build support for human beings, and we put collaboration right at the heart of our technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="series-a">Series A</h2>
<p>As a team, we've always thought about the long-term, and we've grown Replit responsibly. We have so much conviction in our mission and our plan that we're willing to take our time. </p>
<p>Last year, with rapid growth in all aspects of our business, we felt it was a good time to raise a sizeable round to make faster progress our mission. We raised <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/">$20M in Series A</a> financing led by <a href="https://acapital.com/">A.Capital</a> with strong participation from our seed investors: Andreessen Horowitz, Bloomberg Beta, Y Combinator, and Reach Capital. </p>
<p>Since then, thanks to the new capital and to <a href="https://amasad.me/moad">Engelbartian Bootstrapping</a>, we've accelerated feature development, and there's so much more on the horizon: extra resources for more complex projects, support for any language or package, further dev ops simplifications for novices and pros, business collaboration features, improvements to <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">teacher workflows</a>, high quality content, a game development library, and more breakthroughs in collaborative coding. We're excited to see all the amazing things you build with the tools we provide!</p>
<p>Finally, we're hiring for multiple roles and want to bring on people who share our vision and passion. If you're interested in making computing more accessible while working with a creative and hardworking team building fantastic technology, <a href="https://repl.it/careers">join us</a>!</p>

        <strong>Die Pharmaunternehmen Pfizer und BioNTech wollten nach Informationen von </strong><strong><em>NDR, WDR</em></strong><strong> und "SZ" im Juni von der EU für eine Dosis Impfstoff 54,08 Euro. Der Arzneimittelchef der Ärztekammer spricht von "unseriösem Profitstreben".</strong>

</div>
    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Im Juni des vergangenen Jahres ging bei der EU-Kommission ein streng vertrauliches Angebot der Pharmahersteller Pfizer und BioNTech ein. Darin boten sie nach Informationen von <em>NDR, WDR</em> und "Süddeutscher Zeitung" ihren Impfstoff zum Preis von 54,08 Euro pro Dosis an, bei einer Abnahme von 500 Millionen Dosen. Insgesamt wollten BioNTech/Pfizer also 27 Milliarden Euro für so viel Impfstoff, dass man damit gut die Hälfte der EU-Bevölkerung impfen könnte. Der Preis, so versicherten Pfizer/BioNTech, beinhalte bereits "den höchsten prozentualen Rabatt", der einem Industrieland weltweit angeboten worden sei.
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Mit 54,08 Euro wäre der BioNTech-Impfstoff allerdings mehr als 20-mal so teuer gewesen wie eine Dosis jenes Impfstoffs, den AstraZeneca gemeinsam mit der Universität Oxford entwickelt hat. "Ich halte den Preis für unseriös", kritisiert der Vorsitzende der Arzneimittelkommission der Deutschen Ärzteschaft, Wolf Dieter Ludwig, das Angebot von Pfizer/BioNTech. "Ich sehe darin ein Profitstreben, das in der jetzigen Situation der Pandemie in keiner Weise gerechtfertigt ist."

    <h2>Verständnis für Zögern der EU</h2>


    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Womöglich werfen diese vergleichsweise hohen Preisvorstellungen auch ein neues Licht auf die Zurückhaltung mancher EU-Länder im Sommer gegenüber dem BioNTech-Impfstoff. Ludwig jedenfalls sagt, dass er die EU verstehe: "Ich denke, sie hat mit Recht gezögert bei einem derartig hohen Preis."
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        In einem Interview mit dem "Spiegel" Anfang des Jahres kritisierte BioNTech-Chef Ugur Sahin die Verhandlungen mit der EU: "Der Prozess in Europa lief sicherlich nicht so schnell und geradlinig ab wie mit anderen Ländern", sagte der Firmenchef. "Offenbar herrschte der Eindruck: Wir kriegen genug, es wird alles nicht so schlimm, und wir haben das unter Kontrolle. Mich hat das gewundert."
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Eine Anfrage zu einem Gespräch über das hohe Preisangebot ließ Sahin diese Woche unbeantwortet. Eine Firmensprecherin beantwortete konkrete Fragen zum Angebot nicht, wies aber darauf hin, dass der Preis für den Impfstoff "von verschiedenen Faktoren abhängig" sei. Er liege "in einer gewissen Spanne für alle Länder mit höherem Einkommen". Bisher habe das Unternehmen jedoch keine Gewinne gemacht. Wenn man aber Gewinne aus dem Vertrieb des Covid-19-Impfstoffs mache, wolle man diese "in die Weiterentwicklung dieser Technologie reinvestieren". Ein Sprecher der EU-Kommission teilte per E-Mail mit, dass die EU-Kommission aus vertragsrechtlichen Gründen keine Angaben über die Preise machen dürfe.

    <h2>Offenbar deutlich niedrigeren Preis durchgesetzt</h2>


    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Erst im November kam die EU zu einem Vertragsabschluss mit Pfizer/BioNTech. Der endgültige Preis wird bis heute zwar geheim gehalten, doch nach Informationen von <em>NDR, WDR</em> und "SZ" soll er bei 15,50 Euro pro Dosis liegen. Als erste hatte auch die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters diesen Preis erfahren. Die EU hätte damit also eine deutliche Preissenkung gegenüber dem Angebot im Juni erreicht.
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Auch die USA zahlen in etwa gleich viel. Sie hatten im Juli bereits einen Vertrag mit Pfizer geschlossen, der ihnen 100 Millionen Dosen für 1,95 Milliarden Dollar sicherte. Umgerechnet ergibt das rund 16 Euro pro Dosis.
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
                
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    
        

    

    <h2>Staatliche Subventionierung in Millionenhöhe</h2>


    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Überraschend ist aber nicht nur der hohe Preis, den Pfizer/BioNTech von der EU kassieren wollten, sondern auch die Behauptung in dem Angebot an die EU, man hätte die Entwicklung des Impfstoffes "komplett selbst finanziert".
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Das mag vielleicht für Pfizer gelten. Nicht aber für die deutsche Firma BioNTech, die den Impfstoff entwickelt hatte - auch wenn manche derzeit glauben, dass BioNTech allein mit dem Geld der Hexal-Gründer Andreas und Thomas Strüngmann aufgebaut wurde. 
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Tatsächlich war ihr Engagement entscheidend - aber BioNTech wurde auch mit mehreren Millionen Euro staatlich subventioniert. So teilt das Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) auf Anfrage von <em>NDR, WDR</em> und "SZ" mit, dass das Ministerium "die Gründungsphase von Biontech maßgeblich unterstützt und die entscheidenden ersten Jahre der Ausgründung finanziell und auch strukturell gefördert hat".
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Einen weiteren Schub hatte BioNTech demnach von 2012 bis 2017 als Gewinner des Spitzencluster-Wettbewerbs erhalten, das vom Forschungsministerium mit 12,9 Millionen Euro gefördert worden sei, wie BMBF-Sprecher Stephan Kügele mitteilte. Auf Nachfrage teilt auch die BioNTech-Sprecherin mit, das Unternehmen habe "während der ersten Jahre nach Gründung ca. 50 Millionen Euro Fördergelder durch die Clusterinitiative und EU-Programme erhalten." Im Sommer 2020 bekam die Firma weitere 375 Millionen Euro vom Bundesforschungsministerium für die mRNA-basierte Impfstoffentwicklung zugesagt.
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
                
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    
        

    

    <h2>Impfschutz wichtiger als Aktionärsinteressen</h2>


    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        "Die pharmazeutische Industrie sagt ja immer, die hohen Kosten entstehen aufgrund der Forschungs- und Entwicklungskosten, aber auch, weil der Nutzen so groß ist", sagt Wolf Dieter Ludwig. Tatsächlich könne man den Nutzen derzeit aber nicht endgültig beurteilen und die Forschung und Entwicklung sei zum Teil mit staatlichen Geldern subventioniert worden. Allein die US-Regierung zahlte mehrere Milliarden US-Dollar an verschiedene Hersteller. 
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        "Von daher sind diese hohen Preisforderungen aus meiner Sicht nicht berechtigt", sagt Ludwig. Er verstehe zwar, dass die Aktionäre dieser Firmen auch ihren Anteil wollen. "Aber wir sind derzeit in einer Krisensituation, wo es das Ziel sein muss, nicht nur in den Industrieländern, sondern weltweit zu impfen. Vor diesem Hintergrund, denke ich, haben die Interessen der Aktionäre weniger Bedeutung als die Interessen der Bevölkerungen, die von dieser Pandemie befreit werden wollen."

	<p><span>Tue 16 February 2021</span></p><p>I have no experience in digital logic design. That is, I didn't until I
recently decided that I would like to try designing my own CPU and running it
on an FPGA! If you too are a software engineer with a vague interest in
hardware design, I hope this series of posts about what I've learnt will be
helpful and interesting. In this first installment, I hope to answer these
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is digital logic design?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I get started, and what tools might I use?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In future installments, I will go into more detail about my CPU design and the
RISC-V architecture, as well as hopefully answering these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is fundamentally different from software
  design?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is similar to software design?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the code for my CPU at the time of writing
<a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi/tree/47e94dc6e9665f73c871add002c34d1516fd5106">here</a>
or an up to date version <a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What is digital logic design?</h2>
<p>Digital logic design is designing logic circuits that operate on binary values.
The elementary components are logic gates: an AND gate, for example, has two
inputs and one output. The output is 1 iff<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> both inputs are 1.</p>
<p>Typically, we design synchronous circuits which use flip-flops to store state,
and thereby synchronise the operation of the circuit to a common clock.
Flip-flops are composed of logic gates.</p>
<p>Analogue circuit design is concerned with the electronic components that make
up logic gates, like transistors and diodes. This level of abstraction is often
needed for applications dealing directly with signals derived from analogue
sensors, like radio receivers. When designing a CPU, this level of abstraction
would not be feasible: modern CPUs can have billions of transistors!</p>
<p>Instead, we use tools that can translate our digital logic design into
different useful formats: the configuration of an FPGA (see below); a
simulation; silicon layout.</p>
<h2>What is an FPGA and why are they used?</h2>
<p>We noted above that the same digital logic design tools can be used whether we
are creating a custom ASIC to be made into silicon, or configuring an FPGA. A
Field-Programmable Gate Array is an integrated circuit containing an array of
programmable logic blocks. You could imagine it is as a big array of logic
gates that can be connected together in various ways.</p>
<p>Making a custom chip generally costs millions, and of course once your chip is
manufactured it cannot be changed. Thus, generally FPGAs are used when:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You cannot afford to create a custom ASIC due to lack of capital (e.g. if
  you're just some hacker like me and not ARM or Intel)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot afford to create a custom ASIC because your volume is too low to
  make it worth the high one-off costs (e.g. if you are making a small quantity
  of MRI machines with custom data acquisition hardware)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need the flexibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The downsides? FPGAs have a much higher per-chip cost, and they are generally
much slower as a consequence of being able to connect logic blocks together in
very flexible ways. In contrast, a custom design can be reduced to the minimum
number of transistors, with no concern for flexibility.</p>
<p>I think it's helpful context to compare the custom ASIC design process against
that of an FPGA design:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Logic design</span>: just like we'd do for an FPGA, the logic design of an ASIC is
  done in a hardware description language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Verification</span>: FPGA designs may well be verified, but you might expect the
  process for an ASIC design to be more rigorous – after all, the design
  can't be changed once manufactured! Often verification will involve formally
  verifying<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> parts of the design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Synthesis</span>: This creates a <em>netlist</em>: a list of logic blocks and their
  connections. The connections are called <em>nets</em>, and the blocks are called
  <em>cells</em>. For both FPGAs and ASICs, the cells are vendor-specific.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Placement and routing</span> (P&amp;R): for an FPGA, this involves mapping the logic
  blocks described in the netlist to actual blocks in the FPGA. The resulting
  binary is often called a <em>bitstream</em>.  For an ASIC, this involves deciding
  where to place the cells on the silicon, and how to connect them up. Both
  applications generally use automated optimisation tools for this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What tools do I need?</h2>
<h3>A hardware description language: I am using <a href="https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen">nMigen</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h3>
<p>You may have heard of Verilog or VHDL: both popular hardware description
languages (HDLs). I use "popular" here to mean widely used, not widely loved.</p>
<p>I won't pretend to know much about these tools: I only know that smarter people
than me with vast logic design experience have a lot of hate for them.
Due to the problems with Verilog and other similar tools, there have been
various attempts at making more useful and friendlier alternatives.  nMigen is
one such project, which creates a domain-specific language in Python. In their
own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite being faster than schematics entry, hardware design with Verilog and
VHDL remains tedious and inefficient for several reasons. The event-driven
model introduces issues and manual coding that are unnecessary for
synchronous circuits, which represent the lion's share of today's logic
designs. Counterintuitive arithmetic rules result in steeper learning curves
and provide a fertile ground for subtle bugs in designs. Finally, support for
procedural generation of logic (metaprogramming) through "generate"
statements is very limited and restricts the ways code can be made generic,
reused and organized.</p>
<p>To address those issues, we have developed the nMigen FHDL, a library that
replaces the event-driven paradigm with the notions of combinatorial and
synchronous statements, has arithmetic rules that make integers always behave
like mathematical integers, and most importantly allows the design's logic to
be constructed by a Python program. This last point enables hardware
designers to take advantage of the richness of the Python language—object
oriented programming, function parameters, generators, operator overloading,
libraries, etc.—to build well organized, reusable and elegant designs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If, like me, you've never used Verilog, then not all of this will have more
than abstract meaning to you. But it certainly sounds promising,
and I can attest that it has been very straightforward to get started with
logic design without the reportedly large barrier of grappling with Verilog. I
would recommend it, particularly if you are already familiar with Python!</p>
<p>The only downside I can think of is that nMigen is still in development, and
in particular the documentation is not complete. There is a helpful community
at #nmigen on <a href="https://mcla.ug/blog/chat.freenode.net">chat.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<h3>A wave viewer for inspecting simulations: I am using <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/">GTKWave</a></h3>
<p>nMigen provides simulation tooling: I use it in my tests, written using
<code>pytest</code>. I record the signals during these tests and view them in a wave
viewer to help debug.</p>
<p><img alt="gtkwave" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/gtkwave.png" title="A screenshot of GTKWave"></p>
<h3>Optional: An FPGA dev board. I am using a myStorm BlackIce II</h3>
<p>You don't need an FPGA dev board to create your own CPU. You could do
everything in simulation! The fun of having a board to work with, for me, is
being able to flash LEDs and see my design in action.</p>
<p>Of course, if you were creating something more useful than my very basic CPU,
then you would probably want some hardware to run it on, and this would be less
"optional"!</p>
<h2>Getting started with nMigen</h2>
<p>Rather than immediately trying to design a CPU, I started by making an
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in nMigen. The ALU is a key piece of any CPU design
that I have seen: it performs arithmetic operations.</p>
<p>Why start with this? I knew I would need an ALU for my CPU; I knew I could make
a simple one; I knew that the feeling of making something is an important
motivator when starting a new project!</p>
<p>My design looked something like this:</p>

<p>As you can see, we've created a lot of nMigen <code>Signal</code> instances to represent
well...the signals that define the interface to our ALU! But what is this
<code>elaborate</code> method? My understanding is that "elaboration" is the name for the
first step in synthesising the netlist (see above). The idea in the nMigen code
above is that we've created some <em>elaboratable</em> structure (by inheriting from
<code>nm.Elaboratable</code>), i.e. something that describes digital logic we want to
synthesise. The <code>elaborate</code> method describes that digital logic. It has to
return an nMigen <code>Module</code>.</p>
<p>Let's have a closer look at the contents of the <code>elaborate</code> method. The
<code>Switch</code> will create some kind of decision logic in the synthesised design.
But what is <code>m.d.comb</code>? nMigen has the concept of synchronous (<code>m.d.sync</code>)
and combinatorial<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> (<code>m.d.comb</code>) control domains. From the nMigen
<a href="https://nmigen.info/nmigen/latest/lang.html#lang-domains">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A control domain is a named group of signals that change their value in
identical conditions.</p>
<p>All designs have a single predefined <em>combinatorial domain</em>, containing all
signals that change immediately when any value used to compute them changes.
The name comb is reserved for the combinatorial domain.</p>
<p>A design can also have any amount of user-defined <em>synchronous domains</em>, also
called clock domains, containing signals that change when a specific edge
occurs on the domain’s …</p></blockquote></div></div></div>

    <p>Greetings from the Scala 3 team! We are delighted to announce the first release candidate of the stable version of Scala 3 – Scala 3.0.0-RC1.</p> 
    <p>This release brings some last-minute polishings, clean-ups and changes before the big release. There were a few language changes to improve the user experience, as well as the polishings of the metaprogramming framework. We have also worked on the issues that had to be fixed before the stable release.</p> 
    <p>Overall, more than <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A%3E2020-12-02+sort%3Acomments-desc">400 PRs</a> were merged after the M3 release and until today! Read more below!</p> <!--more--> 
     
    <p>Type parameters on extensions can now be combined with type parameters on the methods themselves. E.g.:</p> 
    <pre><code>List(1, 2, 3).second[Int]
extension [A](xs: List[A])
   def sumBy[B](f: A =&gt; B)(using Numeric[B]): B = ...
</code></pre> 
    <p>Type arguments matching method type parameters are passed as usual:</p> 
    <pre><code>List("a", "bb", "ccc").sumBy[Int](_.length)
</code></pre> 
    <p>By contrast, type arguments matching type parameters following <code>extension</code> can be passed only if the method is referenced as a non-extension method:</p> 
    <pre><code>sumBy[String](List("a", "bb", "ccc"))(_.length)
</code></pre> 
    <p>Or, when passing both type arguments:</p> 
    <pre><code>sumBy[String](List("a", "bb", "ccc"))[Int](_.length)
</code></pre> 
    <p>For discussion, see <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10940">PR #10940</a>. For more information about the extension methods, see <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/extension-methods.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
     
    <p>The following are the changes to the <code>import</code> syntax made in this release.</p> 
    <p>Wildcard import <code>_</code> is replaced by <code>*</code>. The motivation is that the majority of other languages use <code>*</code>. For example:</p> 
    <pre><code>import scala.annotation.*  // imports everything in the annotation package
</code></pre> 
    <p>Renaming operator <code>=&gt;</code> is replaced by a soft keyword <code>as</code>. <code>as</code> is also allowed outside braces. For example:</p> 
    <pre><code>import scala.collection.mutable as mut
import NumPy as np
</code></pre> 
    <p>For the details and discussion, see <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11244">PR #11244</a>. Read more about this change in the <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/changed-features/imports.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
     
    <p><a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11240">PR #11240</a> changed the syntax of vararg splices in patterns and function arguments. The new syntax uses a postfix <code>*</code>, instead of <code>: _*</code>, analogously to how a vararg parameter is declared.</p> 
     
    <p>An obscure use of <code>_</code> occurs in var definitions:</p> 
    <pre><code>var x: T = _
</code></pre> 
    <p>It defines a concrete variable x without an initial value, or rather the default initial value that the JVM assigns to object fields. It can only be used in a class or object, not to initialize a local variable.</p> 
    <p>We came up with an arguably better way to express this idiom: the special <code>uninitialized</code> value in the <code>scala.compiletime</code> object. To get an uninitialized field, you now write:</p> 
    <pre><code>import scala.compiletime.uninitialized

var x: A = uninitialized
</code></pre> 
    <p>This way expresses the intent of the idiom in a more verbose and easy to read way than simply writing an underscore.</p> 
    <p>For discussion, see <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11231">PR #11231</a>, and the <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/dropped-features/wildcard-init.html">documentation</a> is available on our website.</p> 
     
    <p>Starting from RC1, we no longer generate a function parent for companions of case classes. Which means, for example, that given <code>case class Foo(x: Int)</code>, you won't be able to use <code>Foo</code> in a position where a function is expected:</p> 
    <pre><code>case class Foo(x: Int)
def f(g: Int =&gt; Foo) = g(10)

f(Foo)
</code></pre> 
    <p>Results in:</p> 
    <pre><code>1 |f(Foo)
  |  ^^^
  |The method `apply` is inserted. The auto insertion will be deprecated, please write `Foo.apply` explicitly.
</code></pre> 
    <p>As the warning suggests, now you should write <code>Foo.apply</code> instead of <code>Foo</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/6190">Issue #6190</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/7207">PR #7207</a> for discussion.</p> 
     
    <p>We have settled on using the well-known <code>scaladoc</code> as a name for the documentation tool for Scala 3 (known previously as <code>scala3doc</code>).. The obsolete <code>dotty-doc</code> (or <code>scala3-doc</code>) is removed in RC1. We have also removed all the Kotlin dependencies (Dokka, etc.) from scaladoc. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11349">PR #11349</a>. To read more about <code>scaladoc</code>, see <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/usage/scaladoc/index.html">documentation</a></p> 
     
    <p><a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11355">PR #11355</a> changes the <code>-source</code> specifier for the Scala version(s) after 3.0 from <code>3.1</code> to <code>future</code>. I.e. it is now <code>-source future</code> and <code>-source future-migration</code> instead of <code>-source 3.1</code> and <code>-source 3.1-migration</code>. Language imports are changed analogously. The reason for the change is that we want to keep the possibility open to ship a <code>3.1</code> version that does not yet contain all the changes enabled under <code>-source future</code>.</p> 
     
    <ul> 
     <li>Warn when matching against an opaque type <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10664">#10664</a></li> 
     <li>Fix <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/8634">#8634</a>: Support -release option <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10746">#10746</a> – the same way Scala 2 does. This setting allows you to specify a version of the Java platform (8, 9 etc) and compile the code with classes specific to the that Java platform, and emit the bytecode for that version.</li> 
    </ul> 
     
    <p>A lot of work has been done on the metaprogramming side of things. Mostly we are cleaning up and polishing the API to prepare it for the stable release. The following are the important metaprogramming changes that took place:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Add <code>scala.quoted.Expr.unapply</code> as dual of <code>Expr.apply</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10580">#10580</a></li> 
     <li>Remove <code>Expr.StringContext.unapply</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10675">#10675</a></li> 
     <li>Add reflect <code>MatchCase</code> <code>TypeRepr</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10735">#10735</a></li> 
     <li>Rename <code>scala.quoted.staging.{Toolbox =&gt; Compiler}</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11129">#11129</a></li> 
     <li>Fix <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/10863">#10863</a>: Make show <code>AnyKind</code>ed <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10988">#10988</a></li> 
     <li>Add ParamClause to allow multiple type param clauses <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11074">#11074</a></li> 
     <li>Rework reflect Symbol fields API <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10705">#10705</a></li> 
     <li>Rename <code>Liftable</code> to <code>ToExpr</code> and <code>Unliftable</code> to <code>FromExpr</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10618">#10618</a></li> 
     <li>Expand non-transparent macros after Typer <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9984">#9984</a></li> 
     <li>Rework TastyInspector API to allow inspection of all files <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10792">#10792</a></li>

February 18, 2021 | https://rockset.com/blog/rockset-up-to-9x-faster-than-apache-druid-star-schema-benchmark/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rockset.com/blog/rockset-up-to-9x-faster-than-apache-druid-star-schema-benchmark/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Real-time analytics is all about deriving insights and taking actions as soon as data is produced. When broken down into its core requirements, real-time analytics means two things: access to fresh data and fast responses to queries. These are essentially two measures of latency, which we term data latency and query latency, respectively.</p>
<p>Data latency is the time from when data is produced to when it can be queried, and is a function of how efficiently a database can sustain writes. As it usually gets less focus in benchmarks, we released <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/rockset-1-billion-events-in-a-day-with-1-second-data-latency/">RockBench</a>, a data latency benchmark, last September. Using RockBench, we ascertained Rockset’s suitability for many real-time analytics applications due to its ability to keep data latency to under 1 second, while ingesting 1 billion events per day, on a standard 4XLarge Virtual Instance.</p>
<h3>Query Latency and the Star Schema Benchmark</h3>
<p>Query latency is the second key measure of real-time analytics performance and is the focus of the rest of this post.
To evaluate query latency, we turned to the Star Schema Benchmark (SSB), an industry-standard benchmark to measure database performance on analytical applications. The SSB was designed for a batch analytics scenario, rather than real-time analytics, but will still yield useful insight into Rockset’s performance on analytical queries.</p>
<p>The SSB has also been used for performance measurements of other modern data technologies. In June 2020, Imply released a <a href="https://go.imply.io/rs/910-OTN-223/images/Apache-Druid-and-Google-BigQuery-performance-evaluation.pdf">study</a> of Apache Druid and Google BigQuery performance on the SSB. For the Rockset benchmark, we used the same hardware resources that were used in the Druid benchmark to provide greater context for our SSB evaluation.</p>
<h3>Up to 9.4x Faster than Druid</h3>
<p>From the benchmarking results, we observed one SSB query execute 9.4x faster on Rockset than on Druid, with many queries running 2x to 4x faster. The entire SSB suite ran 1.5x faster on <a href="https://rockset.com/comparisons/rockset-vs-apache-druid">Rockset compared to Druid</a>. This demonstrates better performance with resource parity, since pricing was not available for a true price-performance comparison.</p>
<p>In making these comparisons, we recognize we are not experts in configuring Druid, so we relied on a benchmark report from those who have the most knowledge about their system and can tune it best. In addition, benchmarks represent a snapshot in time, and systems will get faster with each new release. We are using the most recent benchmark published by Imply for comparison, but we expect Druid performance will continue to improve, as will Rockset’s.</p>
<h3>Running the Star Schema Benchmark on Rockset</h3>
<p><strong>Benchmark Overview</strong></p>
<p>The SSB comprises a suite of 13 analytical SQL queries that provide a good combination of functional and selectivity coverage.</p>
<p>We conducted the benchmark using SSB data at scale factor 100, which corresponds to 100GB and 600M rows of data. We denormalized the generated data prior to loading to provide a more direct comparison to the Druid benchmark, which avoided query-time joins, since Druid only recently added some limited join support.</p>

<p>Loading into Rockset was straightforward and required zero configuration, apart from specifying some keys for column-based clustering. Once the SSB data was loaded into Rockset, we ran a load-generator query script, based on the Rockset Python client, that issued queries and measured runtimes.</p>

<em>Figure 2: Benchmark results when running SSB on Rockset (600M rows, 100GB data set)</em></p>
<p>All queries in the SSB suite executed in under 1 second on Rockset, with a median runtime of 254 ms. This result demonstrates Rockset’s ability to run complex analytics with sub-second performance, a common requirement for real-time analytics applications.</p>
<p>When comparing to these results with Druid’s, we observe that 9 out of the 13 queries ran faster on Rockset. Rockset was 9.4x faster on the query with the largest speedup, with many queries in the 2x to 4x range, whereas Druid’s largest advantage was a 3.2x speedup. The suite of 13 queries completed in 4,146 ms on Rockset compared to 6,043 ms on Druid, corresponding to a 1.5x speedup overall. The following figures show Rockset’s query runtimes compared to those reported in Imply’s Druid and BigQuery paper.</p>

<em>Figure 4: Graph showing Rockset, Druid and BigQuery runtimes on SSB queries</em></p>
<h3>How Rockset Accelerates Real-Time Analytics</h3>
<p>Several Rockset features work in concert to accelerate these SSB queries and real-time analytics in general.</p>
<ul>
<li>Converged Index™</li>
<li>Column-based clustering</li>
<li>Vectorization</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Converged Index</strong></p>
<p>Rockset stores all ingested data in a <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/how-rocksets-converged-index-powers-real-time-analytics/">Converged Index</a>, which is a combination of: </p>
<ul>
<li>Inverted index</li>
<li>Column-based index</li>
<li>Row-based index</li>
</ul>
<p>Each query can take advantage of the index that is best suited for it and leads to the fastest execution. For instance, highly selective queries typically benefit from using the inverted index, while queries that require aggregations over large numbers of records will benefit from using the column-based index. By indexing data in three different ways, multiple types of queries can be executed efficiently without any manual intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Column-based clustering</strong></p>
<p>Users can configure column-based clustering so as to colocate data according to a clustering key they specify. This maximizes the opportunity for sequential access and reduces the amount of data that needs to be scanned for each query.</p>
<p><strong>Vectorization</strong></p>
<p>Rockset uses columnar data chunks to exchange data between query execution operators. This allows vectorized processing, where operations are performed on many values, instead of one value, at a time, resulting in more efficient query execution.</p>
<h3>What This Means for Developers of Real-Time Analytics</h3>
<p>With this SSB performance evaluation, we determined that Rockset is capable of delivering the sub-second query latency needed for real-time analytics, with better performance than alternatives like Druid. Coupled with the earlier RockBench evaluation that established Rockset’s ability to analyze data being written in real time, we see that Rockset can be a good fit for real-time analytics applications that require fast queries on the latest data. These include many use cases like logistics tracking, security analytics, e-commerce personalization, gaming leaderboards and customer-facing SaaS analytics.</p>
<p>While this evaluation was performed on a denormalized data set, Rockset's design also allows it to execute joins efficiently, so applications are not limited to operating on denormalized data. Future work would include running Rockset performance evaluations involving joins on normalized data.</p>
<p>Additionally, SSB data is well structured and therefore less representative of the real-life semi-structured data sets we commonly come across. It should be noted that Rockset can support the same analytical SQL queries on complex, nested data as well.</p>
<p>Given Rockset’s ability to provide both the write and read performance required for real-time analytics, we invite you to include Rockset in your consideration if you are developing real-time analytics features or products. Read the <a href="http://rockset.com/star-schema-benchmark">Rockset Performance Evaluation on the Star Schema Benchmark</a> white paper to get the details on how we ran the SSB evaluation.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-internal">first post</a> in the Ruby Garbage Collection Deep Dive series, we went through a few definitions to give us a picture of how Ruby stores values in memory. If you haven’t read it yet, <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-internal">read it first</a>! We’ll build on those definitions in this post. Particularly, we’ll talk more about the Ruby Heap, Pages, Slots and RVALUES.</p>

<p>Okay, now that we have those baseline definitions out of the way, this post is going to explain the algorithm Ruby’s garbage collector uses to determine which objects it can collect: the Tri-Color Mark and Sweep algorithm. There are two phases to this algorithm. You guessed it: marking and sweeping. In the marking phase, the garbage collector marks all slots which contain accessible RVALUES. In the sweeping phase, the garbage collector clears the RVALUES out of all slots which are not marked. Let’s dig in!</p>

<h2 id="tri-color-mark-and-sweep">Tri-Color Mark and Sweep</h2>

<h3 id="marking">Marking</h3>

<p>We’ll start off by discussing the marking phase. This is most straightforward to understand if we imagine the <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/ObjectSpace.html">Ruby ObjectSpace</a> to be a directed graph with root nodes. All of the nodes in the graphs are RVALUES. All of the edges in the graph are references from one RVALUE to another.</p>

<p>Ruby’s garbage collector starts at the root nodes and traces every edge it can access from these root nodes, marking every RVALUE it sees through this process. At the end, any RVALUE which was not traced, and therefore not accessible from a root RVALUE will be garbage collected.</p>

<h4 id="tri-color">Tri-Color</h4>

<p>Okay, but the algorithm Ruby uses for garbage collection is called a Tri-Color Mark and Sweep algorithm, so what’s the Tri-Color part all about? The Tri-Color algorithm is a model we can use to understand what Ruby’s garbage collector is doing, and how tracks its progress. The three colors in the Tri-Color algorithm (three shades, really) are white, black and grey.</p>

<p>At the beginning of garbage collection, every slot in the Ruby Heap is white. Then, as part of the initial setup, all slots which contain root RVALUEs are marked as grey.</p>

<p>Root RVALUES are all of the RVALUES that a Ruby program knows it will need to run. Examples of these are RVALUES that exist on the stack of instructions that the program is following, or protected global variables.</p>

<p>With all root slots grey, and all other slots white, we then get to the crux of the algorithm:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>grey_slots</span><span>.</span><span>empty?</span><span>)</span>
  <span>current_slot</span> <span>=</span> <span>grey_slots</span><span>.</span><span>pop</span>
  <span>grey_slots</span> <span>+=</span> <span>current_slot</span><span>.</span><span>referenced_slots</span>
  <span>black_slots</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>current_slot</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We iterate over all grey slots, coloring the slots that their RVALUES reference grey, and coloring themselves black. The algorithm continues until there are no grey slots left. At this point, any black slots contain RVALUES which were reachable by the RVALUEs in the root slots, and any white slots do not contain RVALUES which were reachable so can be swept away!</p>

<p>For the visual learners, here’s a gif of what the algorithm is doing:</p>

<p><img src="https://jemma.dev/assets/mark.gif" alt="mark-gif"></p>

<h4 id="references">References</h4>

<p>There is one detail which needs further explanation here: how does an RVALUE know which other RVALUES it references?</p>

<p>It depends on the type of object. For Ruby builtins, tracing the references are just baked into the garbage collector code itself. For example, to find all references from an array RVALUE, the collector iterates each element in the array and finds its references. For a hash, it will do this for both the keys and the values. This all happens in the garbage collector’s <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/296a2cab07ce530809ee74dee61180fbb3ca6f91/gc.c#L6269"><code>mark_children</code></a> method.</p>

<p>But, when objects are defined by C extensions, the C extensions must mark all child objects on their own. We’ll dive more into this in a future C extensions post (which I’ll backlink here).</p>

<p>Okay, so now that we understand how we find all accessbile objects, we need to learn how to dispose of all unaccessible objects.</p>

<h3 id="sweeping">Sweeping</h3>

<p>At this point, we have two sets: black slots and white slots. Internally, these are represented as a <code>marked</code> bitmap. Every Page on the Ruby Heap has its own <code>marked</code> bitmap with one bit per slot. A <code>1</code> bit means the slot is accessible, or Black in our Tri-Color scheme. A <code>0</code> bit means that the slot is no longer accessible, or White in our Tri-Color scheme.</p>

<p>In addition to holding this <code>marked</code> bitmap, each page also has a <code>freelist</code> which represents slots on that page which do not have live objects. The garbage collector iterates over all pages, finding all slots which are not marked. Where applicable, the garbage collector then adds the unmarked slots to each page’s freelist. If the RVALUES which were occupying these slots are also taking up space in the operating system heap, it also frees this memory.</p>

<p>Once pages have been swept, there might be pages which are now completely unallocated; they have no slots which contain RVALUES. These pages are referred to as “Tomb Pages.” Tomb pages have their memory completely returned to the operating system’s heap. This is really helpful for memory management. It means that sweeping can result in freeing memory, or diminishing the overall size of the Ruby Heap.</p>

<p>Any pages with at least one occupied slot are called “Eden Pages”. The sweeping phase might reduce the number of occupied slots in an Eden Page. The garbage collector will use the freelists from Eden Pages for future object allocations. That is to say, if you instantiate an object, the garbage collector will look for one of these free slots in an Eden Page and place the RVALUE representing your object in there.</p>

<p><img src="https://jemma.dev/assets/eden-and-tomb.png" alt="eden-and-tomb"></p>

<p>There is one more nuance here. As of Ruby 3.0, if auto-compaction is enabled, compaction will actually happen as part of the sweeping phase. A more in depth explanation of how and why this happens will follow in a later post about compaction in this Garbage Collection Deep Dive Series.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>The Tri-Color mark and sweep algorithm is what Ruby’s garbage collector uses to determine which slots hold objects which no longer have accessible references. It marks all of the slots it has references to by following the Tri-Color algorithm in which it follows all references from root RVALUES. Once the garbage collector knows which objects are accessible from the roots, it can begin the sweep phase, where it will add the unoccupied slots to each page’s freelist, and release any operating system memory those RVALUES held. This enables the slots to be reused for new object allocation.</p>

<p>Here are a few new definitions we learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Eden page</strong>: A page which contains slots with RVALUES, might also have empty slots</li>
  <li><strong>Tomb page</strong>: A page which contains only empty slots</li>
  <li><strong>Free list</strong>: A linked list per Heap Page of empty slots</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s it for this post! I’m going to continue writing blog posts in this series, and am also writing a book about managed garbage collection, with a focus on Ruby.

It's kind of hard to put a finger on what exactly the mobile version isn't calculating that the desktop version is; the two versions are almost identical when you use them.</p></div><div><h2>54 tabs:&nbsp;the stress test</h2><p>I&nbsp;bet you have more than 2 tabs open right now, I&nbsp;sure have more. So here's a stress test where I&nbsp;open 54 tabs while measuring the impact on my Mac's RAM and CPU. A dot means I&nbsp;opened a new tab. Hover the dot to see which site I&nbsp;opened.</p></div><div><h2>Is it bad?</h2><p>When I saw the results I got suspicious. Chrome was using way more memory than I thought it would. Maybe it was the virtual machine blocking Chrome's direct access to my Macbook's* GPU?&nbsp;I&nbsp;decided to run the next test, the one with 54 tabs directly on my own Big Sur installation. The results were, well, slightly worse.</p><h3>The graphs don't tell the full story</h3><p>But it's probably not as bad as it looks. It's not a terrible thing that an app actually <em>uses</em> your computer. And you've got to hand it to Chrome:&nbsp;it is fast! </p><p>I'm sure Chrome is going out of its way to manage its memory usage across tabs, keeping the current tab fast and responsive. That's great if you're not running any other macOS apps than Chrome, effectively using Chrome as your operating system, and macOS&nbsp;as a kind of bootloader. </p><p>But when you're using Sketch, Final Cut, Photoshop next to Chrome, that seems to be a problem. MacOS&nbsp;likely tries to tell Chrome to take it easy, and Chrome likely <em>does</em> take it easy. These graphs don't tell that story. </p><p>So no, it's most likely not as bad as it looks, but that doesn't change the fact since switching to Safari, I almost forgot what my fan sounds like.</p><p>And then there's <em>this</em> chart. As we can see, the two browsers heat up the computer almost to the exact same level - Safari even getting slightly warmer. This probably points to psutil not being able to see all Safari's child processes, but only the main ones — despite the fact that Activity Monitor is able to group them. That's a little confusing. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e78c687e58e25134b3fb751/602feb36d1388bb94f881998_EumcL7jXYAEBG_4.png" alt="Image"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p><em>*&nbsp;Macbook 16" from 2019 with2.4 GHz, 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 32&nbsp;GB&nbsp;2667 MHz DDR4 RAM and an AMD&nbsp;Radeon Pro 5500M 8GB GPU</em></p></div></div>]]>

<p>For some reason, this post got picked up again and is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26179601">debated today</a> in 2021, almost 4 years since I wrote it. Some things have changed in the mean time and I might’ve phrased a few things differently if I had written this today. But still, what’s here below is what I wrote back then. Enjoy!</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_.png"><img loading="lazy" width="348" height="450" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_-348x450.png" alt="" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_-348x450.png 348w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_-155x200.png 155w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_-768x992.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_.png 792w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Every once in a while someone suggests to me that curl and libcurl would do better if rewritten in a “safe language”. Rust is one such alternative language commonly suggested. This happens especially often when we publish new security vulnerabilities. (Update: I think Rust is a fine language! This post and my stance here has nothing to do with what I think about Rust or other languages, safe or not.)</p>



<h2>curl is written in C</h2>



<p>The curl code guidelines mandate that we stick to using C89 for any code to be accepted into the repository. C89 (sometimes also called C90) – the oldest possible ANSI C standard. Ancient and conservative.</p>



<h2>C is everywhere</h2>



<p>This fact has made it possible for projects, companies and people to adopt curl into things using basically any known operating system and whatever CPU architecture you can think of (at least if it was 32bit or larger). No other programming language is as widespread and easily available for <em>everything</em>. This has made curl one of the most portable projects out there and is part of the explanation for curl’s success.</p>



<p>The curl project was also started in the 90s, even long before most of these alternative languages you’d suggest, existed. Heck, for a truly stable project it wouldn’t be responsible to go with a language that isn’t even old enough to start school yet.</p>



<h2>Everyone knows C</h2>



<p>Perhaps not necessarily true anymore, but at least the knowledge of C is very widespread, where as the current existing alternative languages for sure have more narrow audiences or amount of people that master them.</p>



<h2>C is not a safe language</h2>



<p>Does writing safe code in C require more carefulness and more “tricks” than writing the same code in a more modern language better designed to be “safe” ? Yes it does. But we’ve done most of that job already and maintaining that level isn’t as hard or troublesome.</p>



<p>We keep scanning the curl code regularly with static code analyzers (we maintain a <em>zero <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/curl">Coverity</a> problems</em> policy) and we run the test suite with <a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer">address sanitizers</a>.</p>



<h2>C is not the primary reason for our past vulnerabilities</h2>



<p>There. The simple fact is that most of our past vulnerabilities happened because of logical mistakes in the code. Logical mistakes that aren’t really language bound and they would not be fixed simply by changing language.</p>



<p>Of course that leaves a share of problems that could’ve been avoided if we used another language. Buffer overflows, double frees and out of boundary reads etc, but the bulk of our security problems has not happened due to curl being written in C.</p>



<h2>C is not a new dependency</h2>



<p>It is easy for projects to add a dependency on a library that is written in C since that’s what operating systems and system libraries are written in, still today in 2017. That’s the default. Everyone can build and install such libraries and they’re used and people know how they work.</p>



<p>A library in another language will add that language (and compiler, and debugger and whatever dependencies a libcurl written in that language would need) as a new dependency to a large amount of projects that are themselves written in C or C++ today. Those projects would in many cases downright ignore and reject projects written in “an alternative language”.</p>



<h2>curl sits in the boat</h2>



<p>In the curl project we’re deliberately conservative and we stick to old standards, to remain a viable and reliable library for everyone. Right now and for the foreseeable future. Things that worked in curl 15 years ago still work like that today. The same way. Users can rely on curl. We stick around. We don’t knee-jerk react to modern trends. We sit still in the boat. We don’t rock it.</p>



<h2>Rewriting means adding heaps of bugs</h2>



<p>The plain fact, that also isn’t really about languages but is about plain old software engineering: translating or rewriting curl into a new language will introduce a lot of bugs. Bugs that we don’t have today.</p>



<p>Not to mention how rewriting would take a huge effort and a lot of time. That energy can instead today be spent on improving curl further.</p>



<h2>What if</h2>



<p><em>If I would start the project today, would I’ve picked another language?</em> Maybe. Maybe not. If memory safety and related issues was the primary concern I had, then sure. But as I’ve mentioned above there are several others concerns too so it would really depend on my priorities.</p>



<h2>Finally</h2>



<p>At the end of the day the question that remains is: would we gain more than we would pay, and over which time frame? Who would gain and who would lose?</p>



<p>I’m sure that there will be or it may even already exist, curl and libcurl competitors and potent alternatives written in most of these new alternative languages. Some of them are absolutely really good and will get used and reach fame and glory. Some of them will be crap. Just like software always work. Let a thousand curl competitors bloom!</p>



<p>Will curl be rewritten at some point in the future? I won’t rule it out, but I find it unlikely. I find it even more unlikely that it will happen in the short term or within the next few years.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<div>
<h3><em>This is part of our article series published as “OpenZFS in Depth”. <a href="https://klarasystems.com/articles/"><strong><span>Subscribe to our article series</span></strong> </a>to find out more about the secrets of OpenZFS</em></h3>



<hr>



<p><strong><em>Isaac Huang’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPU3rIHyCTs">talk at the OpenZFS 2017 developers summit</a> witnessed the expansion of the ZFS storage endurance envelope for large installations.&nbsp; dRAID or distributed RAID is a new vdev type that complements existing ZFS data protection capabilities for very large storage arrays.&nbsp; Starting with the RAID-Z-like underpinnings, dRAID permutes, or mixes, disk blocks together in a way where accesses are evenly spread across all the drives. Fast spindle replacement is accomplished by using all members of the pool, using pre-allocated virtual spares, spread evenly over all the spindles. Contributors include Intel, Lawrence Livermore Labs, and HP Enterprise, which have material interest in storage at datacenter scale and high reliability. The OpenZFS user community are the benefactors of this enhancement if we apply it well.</em></strong></p>



<h3><strong>Avoiding the Death Spiral</strong></h3>



<p>Admins will often use wide RAID stripes to maximize usable storage given a number of spindles. RAID-Z deployments with large stripe widths, ten or larger, are subject to poor resilver performance for a number of reasons. Resilvering a full vdev means reading from every healthy disk and continuously writing to the new spare. This will saturate the replacement disk with writes while scattering seeks over the rest of the vdev. For 14 wide RAID-Z2 vdevs using 12TB spindles, rebuilds can take weeks. Resilver I/O activity is deprioritized when the system has not been idle for a minimum period. Full zpools get fragmented and require additional I/O’s to recalculate data during reslivering. A pool can degenerate into a never ending cycle of rebuilds or loss of the pool Aka: the Death Spiral.</p>



<p>As spindles age together, disks may fail in groups as defect counts and mechanical failure are not independent random processes with respect to age. SSD’s further complicate this math as the wear leveling endurance will be very closely matched and clusters of devices under identical load may fail together.&nbsp; Manufacturer provided mean time to failure is a forward-looking statement and is not suitable for replenishment planning. One manufacturer claims 1.2 Million hour MTBF: a dubious 137 year commitment to quality. It’s poor planning to assume any drive isn’t going to pick today to dramatically fail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>dRAID is an option providing rapid parity rebuild that can mitigate the death spiral behaviour of wide RAIDZ stripes, but as reflected in its default width setting of eight, it does not encourage wide stripes. Dedicating sufficient parity increases the durability of the ZFS pool and the investment in parity should be informed by the risk of losing the pool.</p>



<h3><strong>Distributed Spares?</strong></h3>



<p>Spare disks are a way of keeping a disk warm and ready to replace a failed member. Usually, a spare’s life is leisurely idle until they are scrammed into action during a rebuild. That idleness is a wasted opportunity to do useful work. There are no specific spare disks in a dRAID. Rather, enough blocks are allocated throughout out the vdev to act as spares. The distributed spare is a clever redistribution of work so that all disks are always in use. A disk failure precipitates a rebuild into that dedicated space. After replacement disks are available, the vdev can be re-balanced to return the spare block and put the replacement disk in to use.</p>



<h3><strong><strong><strong>Fixed Stripe Width</strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>Unlike RAID-Z, an entire stripe in dRAID is allocated at once, no matter how many disk blocks are needed to store the object. The stripe width is determined by the disk sector size multiplied by the number of data drives in the RAID group.</p>



<div data-columns="3" data-layout="50-25-25"><div>




<div><div>
<p>Did you know?</p>



<h2>You can maximize the <strong>power of your FreeBSD</strong> infrastructure with our <strong>Support Subscription!</strong></h2>




</div></div>




</div></div>



<p>RAID-Z has a method of optimizing block layout to minimize block allocations for small files. dRAID however priorities the speed of rebuilding parity and does not make the same space preserving attempt. If your files are a small fraction of the stripe size, dRAID will not be able to use all the disk blocks fully. For example, a default dRAID vdev has a stripe with of 32k (4k per disk, 8 disks); any allocation will require at least 32k. Internal padding is allocated to fill out the stripe width after the request object is stored. Using a smaller stripe width or providing a special mirror vdev will suit smaller allocations and improve drive utilization.</p>



<h3><strong>A Tale of Two Resilvers</strong></h3>



<p>After a failure, the real or distributed spare is written to in sequence, following only the parity layout in the space map to rebuild the drive according to parity data. Sequential reconstruction can be accomplished rapidly by issuing large I/O blocks, reducing seeks, and avoiding tree indirection overhead. The rebuilt disk’s contents are not necessarily consistent with the Merkle tree that proves the zpools data is intact.&nbsp; It’s important to reconstruct this bitwise copy of the disk first, allowing the system to return to mostly intact state and return to service. That is to say, the sequential reconstruction process restores the redundancy level of the pool, but without being able to verify the checksums of the data. The advantage to this is that it can be completed much more quickly, reducing the window during which additional disk failures might put the pool at risk.</p>



<p>A healing resilver is triggered automatically after a sequential resilver, it is a final operation that verifies that all the contents of the drives match their initial checksums via block pointer traversal. The healing resilver has a number of optimizations to quickly find and reconstruct writes to the failed disk. When a replacement drive can be added to the pool, the rebalance operation is another sequential resilver followed by a healing resilver.</p>



<p>A scrub is the gold standard for a pool health; however, a scrub might be a prohibitive amount of work, visiting every block allocated in the pool. The healing resilver allows a practical return to operation in an environment where failures must be repaired routinely.</p>



<h3><strong><em>“Are We There Yet? When Can I Play With it?”</em></strong></h3>



<p>According to a report from the January OpenZFS leadership meeting, OpenZFS 2.1 will support dRAID in early 2021. If you must have it now; the head branch of the OpenZFS build against recently supported operating systems: FreeBSD 12.1+, Linux 5.10+, Illumos, NetBSD et al. The OpenZFS regression test suite ztest is a good indication that dRAID satisfies the ZFS commitment to data protection. Corporate customers at IBM and Panasas have been flogging other distributed RAID systems for more than ten years. It’s a mature concept that complements the ZFS tool set.</p>



<h4><strong>Quick Start</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no better way to learn software than to run headlong into mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ll install ZFS head from source and gin up some ‘md’ file backed disks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘zpool create r2dRAID dRAID2:3d:1s:14c /dev/md1 /dev/md2 ….&nbsp; /dev/md13 /dev/md14’</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There it is, a zpool with a dRAID vdev, ready to go to work.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The OpenZFS wiki has a good description of <a href="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Basic%20Concepts/dRAID%20Howto.html">dRAID care, resilvering and rebalancing</a></p>



<p>Following the life cycle of failure and replacement in the documentation is recommended before those skills are tested in production.</p>



<h4><strong>dRAID Nomenclature</strong></h4>



<p>Let’s decode the nomenclature that describes the geometry of a dRAID vdev. A string such as “dRAID2:3d:14c:1s” encodes the following about a dRAID vdev.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -dRAID[&lt;parity&gt;][:&lt;data&gt;d][:&lt;children&gt;c][:&lt;spares&gt;s]</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -parity: Required, the number of spindles to use to store parity information. Eg: A dRAID3 can survive until a fourth disk failure without losing data. Parity may be 1,2 or 3.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -[d] data: (spindles per RAID group): Determines the width of the data stripe, 8 is the default. Larger values will increase the stripe width and reduce total parity.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -[c] children: This parameter should match the number of device entries that you feed to the vdev. A helpful check will warn you if you don’t get the right number of disks named correctly: “invalid number of dRAID children; 14 required but 13 provided”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -[s] spares: The number of disk areas to mix in as distributed spares. No spares are created by default, a maximum of four are welcome. Each spare will remove a fraction of space from every disk.</p>



<h2><strong>Parting Short</strong></h2>



<p>The dRAID offers a solution for large arrays, vdevs with fewer than 20 spindles will have limited benefits from the new option. The performance and resilver result will be similar to RAIDZ for small numbers of spindles. Installations with many spindles will see the best results with regards to performance, fast spare activation and replacement. The benefits come with the associated cost of whole stripe at a time allocation for small objects in the pool. This overhead should be calculated in the design of the pool before it’s an operational surprise.</p>



<p>There is no free lunch with dRAID for in saving parity or spare drives, they are your defense against data loss. As drives increase in size, their time to resilver increases and the amount of data they can destroy increases.</p>

			<p><span>C</span>arl Hart is a neuroscientist and Ziff Professor of Psychology at Columbia University—he was the first tenured African-American professor of sciences at Columbia. His research focuses on the “behavioral and neuropharmacological effects of psychoactive drugs in humans.” Hart’s new book, <i>Drug Use For Grown-Ups</i>, is a bold and engaging effort to counter what he sees as generations of misinformation and moral grandstanding about drug use. Today’s “sensationalistic media coverage of the opioid crisis continues a long, awful tradition of exploiting ignorance and fear to vilify certain members of our society,” Hart writes. The media is not the only problem. Scientists, he states, “have frequently overinterpreted and distorted” drugs’ effects on the brain.</p><p>Hart reports that more than 70 percent of drug users—whether they use alcohol, cocaine, prescription medications, or heroin—do not meet the health criteria for drug addiction. In <i>Drug Use for Grown-Ups</i>, Hart strives to “present a more realistic image of the typical drug user: a responsible professional who happens to use drugs in his pursuit of happiness.” With genial candor, Hart presents himself as a model drug user. “I am now entering my fifth year as a regular heroin user,” he writes. “I do not have a drug-use problem. Never have. Each day, I meet my parental, personal, and professional responsibilities. I pay my taxes, serve as a volunteer in my community on a regular basis, and contribute to the global community as an informed and engaged citizen. I am better for my drug use.”</p><p><i>Nautilus</i> caught up with Hart to discuss his drug use and his sharp points about science and society. He was as casually bold in conversation as he is in <i>Drug Use for Grown-Ups</i>.</p><figure data-alt="MacNamara_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18174_0f004440ba0c8f1ccc5c355f3d77207f.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>HABIT OF A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PERSON:</strong> “My heroin use is as rational as my alcohol use,” Carl Hart writes. “Like vacation, sex, and the arts, heroin is one of the tools that I use to maintain my work-life balance.”</span><span>Courtesy of Carl Hart</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>You say “most drug-use scenarios cause little or no harm and that some responsible drug-use scenarios are actually beneficial for human health and functioning.” How so?</b></p><p>Let’s just talk about alcohol first. When you’re at a wedding reception, alcohol serves as a social lubricant. People are more gregarious. They talk, they interact. The same is true with cocaine at parties, heroin among friends, or opium among friends, NDMA among lovers. It enhances empathy, openness, and forgiveness, all of these pro-social attributes.</p><p><b>Drug research, you write, is full of bad science. If you had to name one example, what would it be?</b></p><p>The notion that drug addiction is a brain disease. That encapsulates all that’s wrong with today’s science in this area. There is absolutely no data in humans to show that drug addiction is a brain disease. Yet the narrative, the dogma, the dominant perspective is that it does. Even though nobody will dispute that, there’s absolutely no data in humans to support that statement.</p><p><b>Yet opioids do change the brain biologically, do they not?</b></p><p>Yes, opioids bind to a class of receptors called endogenous opioids, which you find in endorphins, for example. Opioids bind to these receptors—just like natural chemicals do—which results in a response. In some cases, because of decreased sensitivities and certain types of pain, they may enhance a sense of euphoria. So it’s really just facilitating what’s already in the body naturally, a system that helps in our survival. Think of fructose or glucose. We add sugar to our tea, our coffee, whatever we have, we add more and more because we like it, it tastes good, and it enhances pleasure. It can give you energy. It can make life more interesting. Humans do not live on logic alone. And so sometimes we do these things, and that’s OK.</p><blockquote><p>People become addicted because they once had a middle-class-paying job that made them someone in their community.</p> </blockquote><p><b>How have scientists “overinterpreted and distorted” the effects of drugs on the brain?</b><br></p><p>Take brain imaging. People often show one image of someone’s brain. Let’s say this person is addicted to methamphetamine, according to DSM criteria, versus the brain of someone who’s not addicted. If you see some difference, some researchers have a propensity to make more out of the differences than are there. There’s a wide range of brain structural sizes, such that when we think about one person’s size of their nucleus accumbens, it may be smaller or larger than somebody else’s nucleus accumbens. But both of the nucleus accumbens, despite their sizes, are within the normal range of human variability. It’s like height. One guy might be 5’10”, another guy might be 6’2”. But we don’t say the guy who’s 5’10” is height deficient. We just say that he’s in a normal range, and he’s not as tall as the other guy. We wouldn’t say one is deficient versus the other. In neuroscience, one of the things that has happened, particularly when it comes to drugs, people have over-interpreted the differences to mean pathology, when, in fact, both of the brain structures are within the normal range of human variability. The overinterpretation is to interpret it as being pathological.</p><p><b>You say the opioid crisis has been sensationalized, and write, “People are not dying because of opioids; they are dying because of ignorance.” What do you mean?</b></p><p>Some people don’t know not to mix specific sedatives with opioids. For example, they don’t know not to mix large amounts of alcohol or large amounts of antihistamines. Specific combinations can lead to respiratory depression, which can lead to death. Another point of ignorance involves people who buy street drugs and don’t necessarily know if the drugs contain contaminants. That’s the kind of ignorance I’m talking about.</p><div>

</div><p><b>So it’s the mix of drugs that is the problem, not opioids like heroin themselves?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Yes, the majority of opioid deaths occur as a result of combining opioids with multiple sedatives. But there are certain opioids that do concern us if taken alone and the person isn’t aware that they have this particular opioid. Those are fentanyl and the fentanyl analogs. These drugs are a lot more potent than something like heroin, meaning they require less of it to produce the effect. Most of the public aren’t seeking fentanyl or its analogs, but people are tainting things like heroin and oxycodone pills with fentanyl or an analog.</p><p>One way to deal with this tainting, this contamination, is to have free drug-checking facilities, where people can submit samples of their drug and get a chemical readout of what is contained in the substance. That way they’ll know whether to take the substance or how much of it to take. The public also needs to know that most people who use these drugs are not addicts. If you understand that, then you know that for the people who do become addicted, we have to look beyond the drug and look at the person’s environment, their life. Do they have co-occurring psychiatric illnesses? Do they have pain that is not treated? All of these kinds of issues become important.</p><p><b>At what point does biological change in the brain lead to physical addiction?</b></p><p>Physical addiction occurs as a result of opioids—or any other drug, alcohol too—being in the body for consecutive weeks or periods, in particularly high doses. And then the body tries to compensate. For example, with opioids, one of the things that happens is that your gut, your gastrointestinal system, slows down the receptors. Your body is trying to compensate by speeding up the gastrointestinal tract. So when the drug abruptly leaves after several weeks of constant administration of the opioid, now the body is unprepared for the drug not being there and it overcompensates. It really ramps up the motility of the gastrointestinal tract, which causes diarrhea, among other things.</p><blockquote><p>It can give you energy. It can make life more interesting. Humans do not live on logic alone.</p> </blockquote><p><b>Why do some people get addicted and not others?</b><br></p><p>The amount of drugs they take, the period at which they take it. Some people can take opioids for extended periods of time. As long as they keep the doses fairly low and they don’t take multiple doses a day, they probably won’t experience physical dependence. It’s just like with alcohol. Most people drink alcohol on a regular basis, but they don’t become physically dependent. Whereas others drink every day in large amounts, and they will become physically dependent.</p><p><b>Why can’t people overcome addiction?</b></p><p>One of the major reasons people can’t overcome it is because we’re not very good at treating addiction in this country. Just think about why people become addicted. A large number become addicted because of co-occurring psychiatric illnesses, because of pain issues, because they once had a middle-class-paying job that made them someone in their home, someone in their community. Those jobs are gone. Then there’s no healthcare or there’s poor education. If your treatment is not addressing these issues, people are not going to overcome it. But if we have treatments that are holistic, and they’re looking at the individual, and not so much the drug, then we’re good. But if we’re just talking about the drug, then we’re already behind the eight ball, then we will lose that battle.</p><p><b>Your definition of addiction follows the DSM-5, which refers to a “substance use disorder” and values functioning over regular ingestion of a substance. How do you define “functioning”?</b></p><p>Functioning is determined by whether a user is happy in meeting their obligations, whatever they may be, whether they’re work-related, whether they’re family-related, or other social sorts of things. The person is not stressed out about their substance …</p></div></div>

    I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-may-be-a-giant-hologram.html?full=true">this
article</a> which presents the hypothesis that the universe is a 3D projection of a 2D
surface, like a giant hologram. I like to read about modern physics. It is so weird and I can't say
I really understand very much of it. But the descriptions provoke strange and fascinating images
and thoughts in my head. Like this one:</p><p>The article mentions the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length">Planck length</a>, which as I understand it is
the smallest distance there is. It's extremely small: 1.6 × 10<sup>-35</sup> meters, which makes
it billions and billions of times smaller than an atom (or even a proton). I'm used to thinking
about computer graphics, so I imagine the Planck length as the size of one "pixel" of the universe.
Nothing can be smaller than a pixel. (The pixels of the universe are small, I calculate the
resolution to correspond to 2.19 × 10<sup>33</sup> DPI.) The radius of the observable universe is
4.4 × 10<sup>26</sup> meters. If we want to fit the universe into a box, its sides would have to
be twice that size. That is 5.4 × 10<sup>61</sup> Planck lengths. So that's the width, height and
depth of the universe in pixels. Quite a good resolution. (Actually since they are 3D cubes instead
of 2D squares, I should call them voxels instead of pixels. All 1.61 × 10<sup>185</sup> of
them.)</p><p>There is also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time">Planck time</a>
which is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length. As light is fast and the Planck
length is tiny (tiniest there is!), you can image that it's a very short period of time. Certainly.
The Planck time is 5.39 × 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds. No measurable time can be shorter than that
according to quantum physics. Thinking about graphics again, this is like a limit on the frame rate
of the universe. Inverting the Planck time, I get 1.855 × 10<sup>43</sup>. So by my surely
incorrect logic, we get the value of the universe's frame rate:</p><p>One thousand eight hundred
and fifty-five billion billion billion billion frames per second.</p><p>I'll say that
again:</p><p>18.55 septillion FPS!</p><p>Video cameras won't be perfect until they can record at
that speed.</p><p>I hope I got the calculations right, but I'm pretty sure my interpretation of the
quantum physics behind this are way off. It's still fascinating to think of the universe as a
computer simulation. Modern physics make it seem more like a video game than ever.<br>

            <p>Lithuania’s Interior Ministry plans to hold drills and assess the need to evacuate Vilnius’ residents in case of an accident at the Astravyets nuclear plant in Belarus, located some 50 kilometres from the Lithuanian capital.</p>
            
            <p>"That will be one of the key questions during the drafting of the exercises schedule and probably going back to the scenarios: do we or do we not need to evacuate Vilnius residents,” Vitalij Dmitrijev, vice minister of the interior, told LRT RADIO.</p>
            <p>The so-called Astravyets drill was held in October 2019 in Vilnius and Svenčionys districts, which are located close to the Belarusian border. During the exercises, authorities prepared to evacuate people from radiation-affected territories, distribute iodine pills, as well as simulated a resident cleanup and monitoring operation.</p>
            <p>The exercise involved around 300 officers, troops and civil servants from six municipalities and 24 institutions. Due to a dispute over the exercise scenario with the Vilnius authorities, officers from the capital did not take part in the drills.</p>

            <!--googleoff: all--><!--googleon: all-->            <p>Previously, the Vilnius authorities cancelled another exercise, planned in early September, to simulate an accident at the nuclear power plant in Belarus.</p>
            <p>Based on the information available to BNS, Vilnius Municipality faced resistance from the government at the time.</p>
            <p>Lithuanian officials say that the nuclear power plant built by the Russian state atomic corporation Rosatom and funded by a loan from the Kremlin was built in breach of international safety standards. Minsk denies all accusations.</p>
            <p>Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are also due to unplug from the Moscow-controlled energy grid that links them with Belarus. Vilnius says that the Kremlin may use the plant to derail the move.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Almost exactly one year ago I quit my job to create a Haskell startup as a solo developer. I had about 20 ideas, but eventually settled on the idea of dependency project health tracking with <a href="https://deadpendency.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadpendency</a>.</p>

<p>This post describes the experience and evaluates Haskell and its ecosystem.</p>

<p><small>Disclaimer: This blog post contains a bunch of memes. They are trying to be humorous, not accurate or fair 😉.</small></p>

<h2 id="why-haskell">Why Haskell?</h2>

<p>Since about 2016 I have had a strong <del>obsession</del> love of Haskell. Prior to learning Haskell, I was an experienced OO style developer but I didn’t really know how to keep improving my raw programming ability. Haskell introduced me to the world of functional programming (FP) which has an almost infinite depth of concepts to learn, which do actually help improve code quality and application architecture.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9eeq.jpg" alt="I should learn functional programming meme"></p>

<p>Haskell is challenging to learn, but extremely fun to write. For my own learning and pleasure, if my startup succeeds, I want to be doing Haskell.</p>

<p>Additionally, I think Haskell is the best general purpose programming language (that you can use in production). In particular, Haskell excels at writing ‘boring’ business applications which is typically what I work on. <a href="https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘Why Haskell For Production’</a> goes into more detail on the benefits Haskell offers.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9fwz.jpg" alt="Haskell is the best change my mind meme"></p>

<h2 id="the-setup-phase">The Setup Phase</h2>

<p>Probably the most challenging part was building out a skeleton architecture to hang my business logic on. I decided to go with, even within Haskell, fairly advanced libraries of <a href="https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>servant</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fused-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>fused-effects</code></a>.</p>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time banging my head against a wall trying to get these libraries to work nicely together. This was primarily from a lack of Haskell ability on my part. I had prepared as best I could, but Haskell is deep and I needed to learn more to work day to day with it. I was lucky enough to eventually find <a href="https://github.com/mitchellwrosen/hspolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an example</a> that marries these two libraries together, which was a life saver. I’m sure I would have gotten there eventually, but I was in a bit over my head at that point.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9j14.jpg" alt="Haskell with servant fused-effects is hard meme"></p>

<p>Haskell is awesome, but like most languages there is cruft and legacy to be avoided. Haskell has a standard library known as <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>base</code></a> which unfortunately has a fair amount of unsafe or unperformant functions included. As such I went with an alternative standard library <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/relude" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>relude</code></a> that builds on and improves <code>base</code>. On top of this, there are many core libraries that are not part of the standard library I wanted to use and have nice patterns around.</p>

<p>Additionally, I was <a href="https://alistairb.dev/haskell-on-google-cloud-is-great">deploying to google cloud</a> and so needed to figure out good patterns for that integration from Haskell.</p>

<p>This setup effort was quite challenging. I spent most of it squinting at compiler errors. Yet it only took about 2 weeks to have a good foundation of code to start building my business logic upon.</p>

<h2 id="building-it-out">Building it Out</h2>

<p>This is when it started to get really fun. I had my core patterns set out and I could focus on building a pipeline. The day in day out of writing out my logic as small pure functions that I composed together was very nice.</p>

<p>Haskell has such impressive auto-magic code generation techniques that you spend much more time focused on the interesting logic of your application rather than boilerplate.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>HappinessLevel</span> <span>=</span>

<span>-- ok not really magic, think 'convention over configuration'</span>
<span>-- where you can have generated sane defaults, or customise if you like</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And personally I think Haskell is quite beautiful to read and write. #notbiased</p>

<h3 id="parsing-libraries">Parsing Libraries</h3>

<p>A lot of the logic of Deadpendency is parsing. Either parsing dependency files or parsing various API responses. Haskell has many excellent parsing libraries, most notably <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>aeson</code></a> for JSON.</p>

<p>Why is this nice in Haskell? The ‘monad’ abstraction is excellent for dealing with code with a lot of failure conditions (ie. parsing) and avoids ‘pyramid of doom’ type code. Haskell worked out really well in this key area.</p>

<p>Another strong positive for writing Deadpendency was testing. Haskell has a lesser-known style of testing libraries that do ‘property based testing’ (PBT).</p>

<p>PBT allows you to write value generators for your data types, which you use to generate 100s or 1000s of test cases. Then, you run these generated values against some function and check that certain properties hold.</p>

<p>For example, part of the Deadpendency logic is generating an HTML report at the end. I had some <code>toHtml :: Report -&gt; HTML</code> function that I wanted to test. So I wrote a <code>fromHtml :: HTML -&gt; Report</code> function where it goes the other way (ok writing that was pretty painful). Then my PBT test will generate 100s of <code>Report</code> values and check that <code>report == fromHtml (toHtml report)</code> (this is known as ‘roundtrip testing’). With this single test I was able to find many edge case bugs with my HTML report generation logic.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9tqj.jpg" alt="Haskell with servant fused-effects is hard meme"></p>

<p>PBT exists in some other languages, but it originated (I believe?) in Haskell so the libraries are excellent.</p>

<h3 id="not-actively-maintained-libraries">Not Actively Maintained Libraries</h3>

<p>A big challenge of working with Haskell was the lack of well-maintained libraries. Ironically, of the 75 (!) packages I depend upon 19 are flagged by Deadpendency as unhealthy (deprecated or inactive). This means I often don’t have the luxury of asking library maintainers to fix bugs. Even if I PR a fix, sometimes that PR will be ignored for months.</p>

<p>This I think is the reality of using a niche language like Haskell. To be clear, I do not think library developers owe me anything, but it is nonetheless a downside when compared to more popular languages.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9xjq.jpg" alt="Haskell not actively maintained meme"></p>

<p>Thankfully Haskell build tools have good support for loading a package from git. This means you can PR some bug fix or feature and immediately use your fork to work around the problem.</p>

<h3 id="compile-times-were-fine">Compile Times.. Were Fine</h3>

<p>I thought I’d call this out as it is a common complaint I see around Haskell. I followed some <a href="https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2019/11/27/keeping_compilation_fast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good advice</a> which kept compilation fast (aside from <a href="https://twitter.com/AlistairBuzz/status/1253507016242294784" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one interesting edge case I resolved</a>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of modules (Haskell source files) - 509</li>
  <li>Number of lines of Haskell - 20090</li>
  <li>Number of dependencies - 75</li>
  <li>Dell 9570 XPS Laptop - (Hex core - 8th-gen Intel Core i7-8750H CPU), 32GB memory</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the numbers?</p>

<h4 id="compile-dependencies-from-scratch">Compile dependencies from scratch</h4>

<p>Time: 17m44s</p>

<p>This is compiling all application dependencies, which needs to be done before you can compile your application code. Rebuilding all from scratch rarely happens as both my dev machines and CI will cache and only rebuild what has changed.</p>

<p>You do sometimes update a very core package which triggers a lot of dependent packages to recompile which can take a while. Although, I usually do dependency updates at the start of the day while I’m sipping my coffee, so usually don’t notice.</p>

<h4 id="compile-app-including-tests-in-development">Compile app (including tests) in development</h4>

<p>Time: 1m1s</p>

<p>Likewise, due to caching a full recompilation rarely happens. As such, most code edits do not trigger many modules to be recompiled and it is fast.</p>

<p>Additionally, Haskell has nice ‘continuous compilation’ tools that fire on save. Usually by the time I actually look at my terminal compilation is already done.</p>

<h4 id="compile-app-for-deployment">Compile app for deployment</h4>

<p>with <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/using-optimisation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full optimisations</a> (-02).</p>

<p>Time: 2m53s</p>

<p>This typically runs in CI. It runs in parallel with a host of other checks such as running my tests, which also take a few minutes. Due to this, the time doesn’t really impact the build + deploy time too much.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4xp4zu.jpg" alt="Compile times meme"></p>

<h3 id="refactoring-pain">Refactoring Pain</h3>

<p>Deadpendency is relatively simple in what it does, but there is a lot of hidden complexity to the problem. Which is to say, it is like 99% of applications 😉. When developing it I was constantly realising I had modelled things a bit too simplistically and would need to refactor.</p>

<p>Haskell is very safe to refactor thanks to the type safety the compiler brings, which is probably the most important thing. However, Haskell does not have great tools to help with refactoring, at least in terms of the restructuring changes I kept making. The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apply-refact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing</a> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retrie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools</a> seem more geared towards complex rewriting of common code, not restructuring modules or renaming identifiers.</p>

<p>As such I did it all manually with text search replace, or just change something and fix all the new compiler errors. This was a bit of a grind and it caused me to delay needed refactoring sometimes.</p>

<p>It’s a pity Haskell doesn’t have the refactoring tools to help in this situation. The dream would be these tools integrated into an IDE.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.redd.it/dbdshzzflgd31.jpg" alt="Haskell had an IDE meme"></p>

<p>(Stolen from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/cjtbfj/society_if_haskell_has_ide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddit</a>)</p>

<p>Having said that, it should be noted that Haskell does have an excellent IDE now in the form of <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haskell Language Server</a> (HLS). The momentum around the project is insane and I applaud the developers. One fixed pain point from HLS is it does auto imports now, which used to greatly contribute to the friction of working with Haskell. I’m sure Haskell will get there eventually.</p>

<h3 id="waiting-for-new-ghc-versions-to-be-usable">Waiting for New GHC Versions to be Usable</h3>

<p>This is mostly me complaining for the sake of it, but as someone pretty obsessed with both new shiny versions of things and Haskell, waiting for new GHC (GHC is the Haskell compiler) versions to be usable has been painful. There is a long tail of libraries and platforms that need to be updated before I can use a new GHC version. Sometimes these updates can drag a lot.</p>

<p>For example GHC 9 was just released, but I still haven’t been able to upgrade to GHC 8.10 yet which was first released in March 2020.</p>

<p><img width="500" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4xebid.jpg" alt="GHC releases meme"></p>

<h2 id="launching">Launching</h2>

<p>So after about 8 months of work I was ready to start getting users. I slowly soft launched, promoting it in a few small channels. How did my Haskell fair in prod?</p>

<h3 id="very-few-logic-bugs">Very Few Logic Bugs</h3>

<p>My core Haskell had very few logic bugs. This is because Haskell is very safe by default and I had opted into strict types that help catch edge cases.</p>

<p>For example, I was using a lot of <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Data-List-NonEmpty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>NonEmpty</code></a> lists which the compiler will guarantee is not empty. To use them you must specify how to handle the empty case. ie. what do I do if Deadpendency can’t find any dependencies to check?</p>

<p>And of course, I had …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>TLS certificates specifying hosts via their CommonName field is more or less gone</h2>

	<p><small>February 17, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>
certificates for hosts and domains must somehow identify what
hostname (or names) they're for. Historically <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TLSCertificatesNamingHosts">there have been two
ways to do this</a>. The first way was a
specific sub-field, the <em>CN</em> or CommonName, of the certificate's
overall <em>Subject Name</em>. This had the problem that it could only
have one name. When people started wanting to have TLS certificates
that covered more than one name, they invented another mechanism,
the <em>Subject Alternative Name</em> (SAN) extension.</p>

<p>As a practical matter, all vaguely modern software that wants to
properly validate TLS certificates has supported (and often preferred)
Subject Alternative Names for some time. A great many TLS certificates
in the wild are for multiple hosts and it's generally unlikely that the
host you're connecting to is the one name that the system chose to put
in the CN field; software that only supports CN cannot validate those
TLS certificates. As a matter of timing, SANs have been theoretically
mandatory since 2002 and checking only SANs has been theoretically
required since 2011 (which means that since 2011 or earlier, the CN was
supposed to always be one of the SANs).</p>

<p>These days, any remaining support for looking at TLS certificate
CommonName to validate TLS certificates is getting more and more
extinct (and more so than I expected when I started writing this
entry). In the browser realm, <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4981025180483584">Chrome apparently turned it off in
58, released in 2017</a>, and then
threw out the option to check it again in Chrome 65 (from the comment
on <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TLSCertificatesNamingHosts">my old entry</a>, which was ironically
written shortly before Chrome did this). Firefox is said to have
removed support in version 48, from August of 2016. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT210176">Safari
apparently stopped looking at CommonName in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15</a>, which I believe date
from late 2019. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/231379">This Go change</a> also talks about
how browsers removed it in 2019 ('last year' for a mid 2020 change).</p>

<p>In non-browser TLS code, Go started ignoring CN by default in
Go 1.15 (released in August of 2020) and this will be the only
option starting in Go 1.17 (to be released in August of 2021),
per <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#crypto/x509">here</a>. Since
Firefox doesn't support CN any more, I assume that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services">NSS</a> doesn't
either, since NSS is basically Firefox's underlying TLS implementation.
I have no idea what other TLS libraries are doing, but I would expect
that many of them will support CommonName for some time to come; TLS
libraries are historically behind browser practices.  Hopefully they
are all following the 2011 requirement to check only SANs when SANs are
present (which they should always be in public certificates).</p>

<p>Probably TLS certificates will continue to contain CommonName fields
for a long time to come. Having a <em>Subject Name</em> in general is
common (although apparently not actually required) and the CN is a
standard (although not required) part of the Subject Name, so you
might as well throw it in. Even Mozilla and Let's Encrypt (still)
have TLS certificates with CNs. However, since I checked this now,
the current <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/Browser Forum</a> <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">baseline
requirements</a>
(version 1.7.3) allow but don't require CommonName (section 7.1.4.2.2,
which says that it's 'discouraged, but not prohibited'). Given how
conservative most Certificate Authorities are, I expect them to be
issuing TLS certificates with CommonName fields until they're
required to stop.</p>

<p>(An interested party could scan Certificate Transparency logs to see if
there were very many issued certificates without CNs. Probably there are
some; someone must have tried it out at some point through an official
CA.)</p>

<p>PS: <a href="https://no-common-name.badssl.com/">no-common-name.badssl.com</a>
has a TLS certificate without a CN, or at least it's supposed to
(<a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/how-to-obtain-a-cert-without-a-common-name/72807/6">via</a>),
but the TLS certificate is expired right now as I write this entry
so it's hard to test how client software behaves. <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/compatibility-testing-of-no-common-name/72863">See also</a>,
which pointed me to <a href="https://no-subject.labs.vu.nl/">no-subject.labs.vu.nl</a>,
which has a currently valid TLS certificate with no <em>Subject Name</em> at all.</p>

		Year History of Opposition to Nuclear Power in California </span></b></span> 
		<br>
	  </p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California 
		citizens have made a unique stand concerning the attempts by Nuclear proponents 
		to make the state a premiere model for commercial nuclear energy. California's major 
		utilities, in particular Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) has spent an
		enormous amount of money and political muscle in attempts to build reactors 
		across California but have mostly failed. PG&amp;E was supposedly involved in 
		the Atoms for Peace proposal made in 1953 and was 
		part of a coalition of american utilities that investigated the technical 
		potentials for building nuclear reactors as a source of electricity.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following 
		is a brief summary of the battles against nuclear power that started here 
		in California in 1958.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern 
		California is the home of the first successful opposition to the promotion 
		and development of commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. In the 1950's 
		northern and central California's privately Owned utility company, PG&amp;E 
		was planning to be one of the giants in the new field of nuclear energy. 
		It had helped design and build the Dresden I reactor in Illinois with 
		a consortium of 5 major companies, including General Electric(GE).</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conjunction 
		with GE, it built the vallecitos nuclear complex south of San Francisco 
		and then went it alone with their Humboldt reactor near Arcata. But their 
		luck took a turn for the worse when they tried to build the world's largest 
		nuclear facility 1000 feet from the fault that caused the 1906 earthquake.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, PG&amp;E 
		even said they could build a reactor in downtown San Francisco! In 
		fact they were planning the construction of 63 reactors in California 
		during the early 1960's, one every 25 miles along the coast They even 
		 planned to build a floating reactor!!</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
		Bodega Bay Duck Pond</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When PG&amp;E 
		started pushing plans to build the reactors at Bodega Pay in 1958 a literal 
		groundswell of opposition erupted during the next 6 years to stop them 
		dead cold. The site they had chosen near the San Andreas Fault Zone was 
		just a few miles from the epicenter of the Great San Francisco Quake where 
		ground shifts of over 20 feet had occurred in 1906.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PG&amp;E's 
		unethical plans to build the reactor is not new for this company, as they 
		have a history of unfair tactics that goes back to the company's birth. 
		Upon deciding that the Bodega Headlands would be an excellent site for the largest nuclear 
		facility in the world, PG&amp;E simply beat the state out in its plans 
		to make the area a state park. </span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The battle 
		started in 1958 when the Santa Rosa Press Democrat published the first 
		story on PG&amp;E's plans. The company's ignored their own geologist, who had warned 
		that the area was likely to be effected by strong shaking during a quake. 
		Concerned citizens started getting involved as PG&amp;E refused to acknowledge 
		publicly that they were actually going to build nuclear reactors at the 
		proposed site.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1957 
		windscale accident in England, where a small reactor had burned out of 
		control for more than a day, helped focus concerns about safety on this 
		new idea of nuclear power.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1961, 
		after nearly 3 years of pushing their plan behind the scenes, PG&amp;E 
		announced plans to build the Atomic Park at the Bodega site. The ensuing battle 
		and PG&amp;E's nasty style started to backfire though as public concerns 
		grew.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major opposition 
		came from within the ranks of the Sierra Club, but the board refused to 
		allow its active members the right to oppose the reactors on the issue 
		of earthquakes. When it came out that PG&amp;E had doctored fault maps 
		of the site, all hell broke loose.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of PG&amp;E's 
		major claims at the time was that they could build reactors that would 
		survive a great Earthguake. At one point they said that the reactors could 
		survive a quake 50 per cent bigger than the O6' quake by floating the 
		reactors on 3 feet of compressable material but when the public and the 
		Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) got a close-up view of the devastation 
		from the air of the quake in Alaska during the spring of 1964, support 
		for the reactor complex dried up.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opponents 
		had "infiltrated" the federal government and were pushing 
		for closure. With the disclosure of the AEC's WASH 740 report, which documented 
		potential dangers to the bay area residents in case of an accident, opposition 
		finally reached all government levels.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California 
		governor Pat Brown asked that PG&amp;E abandon the reactors. Two days 
		later PG&amp;E caved in and called the project off. The battle ended in 
		1964 with a $7 million duck pond as a living monunent to the future. (It 
		is still there today)</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This experience 
		gave PG&amp;E a deadly lesson on how to overcome public concerns at their 
		next reactor site--Diablo Canyon.</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
		Diablo Canyon Nightmare:</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 25 year 
		battle over Diablo Canyon is a classic case of courage in the face of 
		the political power this utility unleashed in its drive to build a major 
		nuclear facility in California.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PG&amp;E's 
		plans to build a mega facility shifted south to the less populated coastal 
		area near San Luis Obispo. The company purchased the Nipomo Dunes and 
		told environmental leaders that unless an acceptable site was chosen that 
		they would go ahead and build a facility at the popular beach area. The 
		wife of the Sierra Club president was selected to come up with an acceptable 
		site in secrecy with the company. </span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site 
		chosen, Diablo Canyon, was California's second to last coastal wilderness 
		area, an area that had been proposed as a National Park due to its beauty. 
		Besides being a sacred Chumash burial ground, it was the home of one of 
		a kind 1,000 year old Oak trees (the largest in the world). It was also 
		the home of one of the state's largest populations of abalone and sea 
		otters.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the process 
		of getting permission to go ahead with Diablo, PG&amp;E suceeded in selling 
		the site to key members of the Sierra Club's board of directors. The Utility 
		had sympathetic board members flown over the Diablo site in Frank Sinatra's 
		Lear jet, with entertainment by Danny Kaye (Danny later came out against 
		the reactors).</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
		slam-dunk by PG&amp;E came against the local farmer who had the right 
		of way access rights over the Diablo property. The company went to court 
		and had his rights removed. The beligerant act made the man a life-long 
		opponent of PG&amp;E's plan.</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PG&amp;E 
		gets Cozy with Sierra Club Board Members</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The biggest 
		tactical plan was to focus on the Sierra Club. The company and the electric 
		industry already had the board's ear with their claims that nuclear power 
		could reduce air pollution that was caused by coal power plants. The utility, 
		with inside help then sought official support for Diablo Canyon when club's 
		only board member who knew about the site's natural value was in Europe. 
		The board went along with PG&amp;E, and in fact voted to block any Club 
		members or chapters opposition to the facility. This move enraged David 
		Brower, eventually resulting in the split up of the club and the creation 
		of Friends of the Earth by embittered Sierra Club members who were angered 
		by the actions of key Sierra Club Board members.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PG&amp;E's 
		success within the Sierra Club was the culmination of 2 years of behind 
		the scenes work by Doris Leonard. She was the wife of the president of 
		the club. Her role in exchanging the Nipomo Dunes site for Diablo Canyon 
		was rewarded later when she was elected to PG&amp;E's board of directors. 
		</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra 
		Club refused to allow its local chapter near Diablo to use the club nane 
		in opposing the five proposed reactors at the site. The group was forced 
		to take on another name in 1966, the Shoreline Preservation Conference.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group 
		was concerned about earthquake faults along the coast as locals were fully 
		aware of the 1927 quake that completely destroyed a nearby city. They 
		called for a full investigation into potential fault areas. Their efforts 
		were ignored by the government and the media.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">News of the 
		reactor siting was poorly covered by the Bay area's conservative media, 
		a tactic that made the issue invisible to bay area residents who had stopped 
		PG&amp;E's Bodega reactor plans.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oil companies 
		chart the Hosgri Fault The Hosgri fault had been mapped by Shell oil geologists 
		during the 1960's, but not published until 1970. PG&amp;E claims to have 
		not found out about the fault until late 1972. The information was finally 
		publicized in November 1973 by an investigative reporter in Los Angeles. 
		In a suspicious turn of events, the lawyer who had been fighting the case 
		since 1965 was found dead in his car just after the announcement. Authorities 
		claimed it was suicide, with no other investigation to follow up.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">P&amp;GE's 
		bad memories of Bodega Bay helped fuel their push to ignore earthquake 
		concerns at Diabl Canyon. The same Seismic experts who had been involved 
		with the Bodega Bay facility were brought in to review the site for seismicity. 
		They pointed out major flaws in PG&amp;E's own $2,000 seismic study. A 
		state of the art study at the time would have cost $100,000)</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
		Hosgri Fault Forces PG&amp;E to Rebuild Diablo Again</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A storm of 
		controversy erupted around the facility as one of the units was reaching 
		completion. Even with the help of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's 
		(NRC) predecessor, the AEC, PG&amp;E was finally forced after 3 years 
		of federal in-fighting to rebuild seismic bracing in 1976.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In attempts 
		to stop a seismic retrofit, PG&amp;E even coined the Tao Effect which 
		said that the bigger the structure, the less damage a quake would have.</span></p>
