Unemployment rose to levels not seen since the Great Depression.</p><p>Shortly afterwards states around the country passed emergency laws to protect the most vulnerable people. In 32 states, governors and public utility commissions (PUCs) passed <strong>utility shut-off moratoriums</strong> to ensure that no households lost their electricity because they couldn’t pay their bill.</p><p>Six months later many of those moratoriums have expired or are set to expire in the next month. Between May and mid-August, 10 states allowed their moratoriums to expire. In the next month another 14 state moratoriums will expire. That means <strong>by October 1st a total of 36 states won’t have moratoriums in place.</strong></p><p>In order to understand the impact of these policy changes, Carbon Switch analyzed data provided by public utility commissions in these states, unemployment data, and energy spending data. Our goal was to understand how many people could be at risk of losing their electricity this year.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="2104617" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="847ece8" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="8833eed" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Key highlights</h3><ul><li><strong>In the next month 34.5 million households will lose their utility shutoff protections as moratoriums in 14 states expire.</strong> About 4 million of those households are currently below the federal poverty line. 4 million people in those states are unemployed.</li><li><strong>76 million American households won’t have utility shutoff moratoriums after October 1st.</strong> By that point moratoriums will be voluntary in 36 states. About 10 million of the households in those states are currently below the federal poverty line.

As they wrote: “Between April 1 and June 30, 1,369,786 residential customer accounts have become eligible for disconnection but have not been disconnected.”</p><p>For context, there are 3,815,392 households in North Carolina meaning that more than a third of households are behind on payments.</p><p>Unfortunately little has changed in North Carolina since that July 15 report and the moratorium is set to expire on September 1st. According to the most recent BLS data, there are 419,812 unemployed people in the state (compared to 199,494 a year ago).</p><p>Wisconsin is another state that released data on how many customers are behind on their utility bills. According to <a href="https://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/5-ui-120_data_update_august_2020.pdf">a recent government report</a> about 33% of utility customers were behind on payments as of July (compared to 12% a year ago).</p><p>When surveyed for that report, 36 of the 41 utilities that responded said they planned to resume shutoffs. We Energies, a utility that serves 1,183,000 customers in Wisconsin said 32,000 customers met disconnect criteria (27% of their total).</p><p>But with millions of shutoffs looming the Public Service Commission in Wisconsin <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/wisconsin-regulators-extend-shutoff-ban-one-third-of-households-behind-on-utility-bills/article_e35facbb-0812-5a32-b213-a8761e3e5036.html">voted</a> to extend the moratorium until October 1st.</p><p>In Florida “accounts in arrears” (the industry term for customers that are behind on payments), are up 60% compared to the year before according to <a href="http://www.psc.state.fl.us/Files/PDF/Utilities/CovidWorkshop/FPL.pdf">presentations</a> by executives at the biggest utilities obtained by Carbon Switch.</p><p>Florida Power and Light, one of the country’s biggest utilities, had 250,000 accounts in arrears as of the end of June.

Few of them specified when they would resume shutoffs. Many of them have quietly resumed shutting off the power on their customers in the months since. While others plan to resume shutoffs in mid-September. One of the country’s biggest utilities, Southern Company — a Georgia-based utility with 9 million customers — never had an internal shutoff moratorium in the first place.</p><p>Carbon Switch gathered data on the number of customers at the 10 largest utilities and their shut off policies. We found that the top 10 utilities control 62% of the investor-owned utility market and serve 63 million customers. (It’s important to note that a customer is a household, not an individual. Considering the average household in America has 2.5 people, their policies likely affect about 157.5 million Americans).</p><p>Here’s a summary of these utilities shutoff policies during the pandemic:</p><ul><li>1 utility (Southern Company) never stopped shutting off their customers’ power.</li><li>3 utilities (Exelon, Xcel, and Florida Power and Light) quietly resumed shutoffs in May and July.</li><li>4 utilities (Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, First Energy, and AEP) plan to resume shut offs in September.</li><li>2 utilities (PG&amp;E and SCE) are barred by California’s moratorium from shutting off their customers’ power until at least next year.</li></ul><p>It’s worth emphasizing that the only utilities that have extended their moratoriums past September 15th are the two utilities based in California, a state with the nation’s longest spanning moratorium. The others plan to resume shut offs despite recent reports that as many as a third of customers are behind on payments in some states.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="b958695" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="1240" height="974" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png 1240w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-300x236.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-1024x804.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-768x603.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="bbfb297" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="fb983df" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="e7cba1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Shutoffs and injustice</h3><p>In 2018 a 72-year-old woman living in Sun City West, Arizona died during a heat wave in which temperatures reached 100 degrees.

		<p>by David L. Duffy.</p>
<p>Personally, I have found some chess analogies, metaphors and thought experiments from philosophers a little unimpressive, speaking as someone who was once a middling club player. Some philosophers have been what I think of as serious players – at least one has been an International Master — but I don’t see their thoughts as widely cited as, for example, Dennett in the case of “Chmess”, or even Sellars’ “Texas Chess”. Serious chess players know there is a technical literature of many thousands of books, and databases containing ~15 million games played since people started recording them. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> They know playing chess is intensely pleasurable and addictive, that winning well is a joy, but even losing is not so bad. Abuhamdeh and Csikzentmihalyi found that maximum pleasure in their study was felt when one’s opponent was 260 Elo points <em>stronger</em> (that is, one’s chance of winning was only 20%). <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Csikzentmihalyi calls chess as played by humans <em>autotelic;</em>&nbsp;that is, intrinsically motivating. Chess players know that chess-thought combines a mixture of “intuitive” pattern recognition and brute force mental visualisation of the future chess positions that will follow particular sequences of moves (“calculation”). They know and enjoy a family of variant forms of chess – I used to play a lot of “Transfer” (known as “Bughouse” in the US), which involves players passing captured pieces to their teammates, who may place them on their board, a la Shogi, but all under a time limit, as well as Kriegspiel where you and your opponent are unaware of each others’ moves, but are informed about captures and checks. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Chess has been of great interest to the computer science community as what was seen as a hard problem for “machines do[ing] the things that would require intelligence if done by men” (Minsky 1968). Now <em>AlphaZero </em>has reached the highest levels in just 24 hours of self-play, it is seen as a trivial mechanical task, much easier than walking without falling over, or working out that the truck in front of your car is not the sky. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> When I played through the originally published <em>AlphaZero</em> chess games, I found them hilarious. They actually have a very human feel, as opposed to those played by conventional chess engines which search through the set of all possible moves a certain number of plies into the future of the current position. (Partly this was because neither program was using standard opening books.) <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> &nbsp;<em>AlphaZero</em>’s open source successor <em>lz0</em> (<em>Leela</em>) has a putative Elo rating of ~3400, about the same as <em>Stockfish</em>, while the best human is ~2800 (so the human might beat the program perhaps one game in a hundred). <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> &nbsp;Computer programs don’t enjoy chess, and don’t have an aesthetic response to beautiful combinations of moves. But the pleasures of the chess player are “merely” the subjective experience of successfully meeting a meta-cognitive goal, one that drives all playfulness, and the related goals of the aesthetics of thought. We get a dopamine rush from our comprehension of elegance, simplicity and complexity, and of surprise (some may remember Koestler’s <em>Ha!</em> and <em>Aha!</em>).</p>
<p>The rest of this essay will be a few comments about how various philosophers have interacted with the game of chess and the playing of chess, but before that I will present a little thought experiment of my own. Many comparisons have been made between the acts of playing chess and carrying out mathematical calculations or solving mathematical problems. If one is some kind of Chess Platonist, one has the image of a Universe of approximately 10<sup>40</sup> possible sequences of moves sitting out there. <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> The Dancing Pixies argument of Putnam, Searle, Bishop, and others is that, with the right interpretation, the interactions between atoms in a rock are computations and thus, for us computationalists, thought. <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; They could also be interpreted as all those chess games. So I now have a concretized Platonic Chess Universe sitting in my garden. One merely needs to <em>construct</em> the apparatus to extract the games from the rock, and if one wished to use these to beat your human opponent, construct a further method of filtering out all the winning games arising from the current position. There are a couple of stories in Stanislaw Lem’s <em>Cyberiad</em> that are relevant, but Mrs Beeton’s recipe for Stewed Rabbit may also apply. <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>(1) If I were asked to answer, in one sentence, the question “What was Wittgenstein’s biggest contribution?”, I should answer “His asking of the question ‘Can one play chess without the queen?’” (Wisdom 1952) <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Well, people spot weaker players a queen all the time, and don’t think anything of it. After all, you can lose your queen during a game anyway, and the resulting play is a subtype of standard play (usually endgame), rather than a new game. If one is playing the Old Indian Opening, for example, the players can choose to enter a Queen-less game in 5 moves. You might refine Wittgenstein and ask whether introducing a new set of rules specifying starting from a particular position (that is, setup of pieces on the board), or playing under the standard rules to get there is the same. Like, there are 10<sup>40</sup> different games lurking in there that people had never noticed before. In the Old Indian example, the players collaborate to reach a Queen-less board, but they may collaborate in all kinds of ways, such as repeatedly playing a particular chess opening variant they are both interested in (or in a grandmaster draw, as a strategy for winning a chess tournament).</p>
<p>(2) From Dummett’s explication of Frege on chess:</p>
<p><span>Proposition 1</span>: <em>Neither chess moves nor positions on the chessboard express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</em> Proposition 2: <em>The theory of chess consists of meaningful propositions about chess moves and chess positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems. </em><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>These seem plausible, but the way I think of chess soon led me to:</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 1</span>: Neither bead moves nor positions on the abacus express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 2</span>: The theory of abacus use consists of meaningful propositions about bead moves and positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems.</p>
<p>I think it obvious that AP1 and AP2 are incorrect. My preferred interpretation for the abacus: Bead movements and positions concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate those of other concrete objects.</p>
<p>My preferred interpretation for chess: Chess moves and positions on the chessboard concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate the concrete objects, actions and decisions of soldiers.</p>
<p>A: chess is a war game.</p>
<p>B: The warfare modeled by the rules of chess is ancient Indian warfare, with peasant infantry, elephants, aristocratic cavalry and chariots.</p>
<p>C: Winning such a battle required the capture or death of the opposition king.</p>
<p>D: Winning usually requires the general to sacrifice many of his own soldiers in order to win, unless the opponent has made an error.</p>
<p>E: A general fights against another general, and usually will plan as if his opponent will make the best response to any given attack, although he will set up traps with the hope they will succumb.</p>
<p>F: Each wields a Theory of Mind that is domain specific, and must incorporate both low-level and high-level properties of the game or the organisation of fighting. For example, chess players and generals both divide up the elements of planning into strategy and tactics.</p>
<p>My preferred conclusion: Although the game is greatly abstracted, there are many high-level analogies to warfare.</p>
<p>As it happens, Deleuze and Guattari make much of these isomorphisms in <em>A Thousand Plateaus&nbsp;</em>, as in the State of chess versus the Nomads of Go/Wei Chi – “chess pieces entertain biunivocal relations with one another, and with the adversary’s pieces: their functioning is structural, while Go pieces… have extrinsic relations with nebulae or constellations”, and so on. <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>My mental model of chess as simulation is therefore similar to a scientific model. There is the reality, the model that abstracts certain features of reality, and the theory that applies to the model. In a game, the pleasures arise in implementing and running the model, but are related to some of those of the reality (this is far more obvious in modern computer games). <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>G: Chess is rational imaginative play.</p>
<p>H. The physical acts of moving the game tokens around are <em>iconic</em> – horses jump, pawns bump into one another so that they can’t move forward, children and adults both use their piece to knock over the opponent’s piece they are capturing, the latter without sound effects. Blitz players pick up the captured piece and use it to tap the clock.</p>
<p>I’ll point to a related line of thought that is not particularly unique to chess. For children, the pastime of chess is supposed to produce transferable, that is, generalized, principles of learning and thinking, that apply more widely than just to warfare. <a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15] </a>One great goal of the AI community is to produce meta-reinforcement learners that can generalize (transfer) lessons from one domain to another domain.</p>
<p>I. Recall that Wittgenstein introduces Sprachspiel initially “as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language”.</p>
<p>J. By 2 years of age, children logically reason about outcomes of a counterfactual premise e.g. what should I do if this banana is a telephone, or which cup was emptied of imaginary tea by being knocked over.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>K. At a later stage of neurological development, children can imagine these little horses fight and jump following the rules of chess.</p>
<p>L. In children’s games, friction arises when someone …</p></div></div>

<p>At the moment, the Epic Games page in the App Store is not available – journalist John Voorhees was one of the first to notice this. The store gives an error whenever you try to go to the page of the company itself or one of its applications using a direct link, but you cannot find it in the search.</p>




<p>Users also noted that downloading apps from Epic, including Fortnite, will not work, even if they are already assigned to a user account.</p>



<figure><img src="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg 289w, https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-195x300.jpg 195w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px"></figure>



<p>Apple released an official statement on this matter – the company noted that they were “very sorry” to take such measures, but Epic left no choice.</p>



<blockquote><p>The court recommended that Epic follow the App Store’s guidelines and policies while the case is in progress – the rules they followed over the past ten years until they created the current situation themselves. Epic refused.</p><p><br> Instead, the company has repeatedly submitted Fortnite updates that violate store rules. This is unfair to all other developers in the App Store and makes users suffer from conflict.</p><p><br> We hope to be able to cooperate again in the future, but at the moment this is unfortunately not possible.</p><p><br> from Apple statement</p></blockquote>



<p>The corporation has warned that it is going to delete Epic Games accounts back on August 17th. Apparently, another account of the company, Epic International, is still available in the App Store – it was previously banned from blocking in court. Therefore, the situation should not touch upon the support of the Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>On the day Epic’s profiles were deleted, the App Store began to actively promote Fortnite’s direct competitor, PUBG Mobile. The online shooter appeared on the main page of the “Games” section, and the promo was published on the store’s official twitter.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The tweet was also noticed by the head of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</p>

<p>While you wait for Fortnite to return to iOS and Mac, here’s another great Battle Royale powered by the Unreal Engine!</p>

<p>Yep, thatâ€™s Rust code with embedded Objective-C syntax, and it works. Why would you do such a thing? Maybe you want tighter interop between the Rust and Objective-C parts of your iOS app. Maybe you want to write your iOS app <em>entirely</em> in Rust. Or maybe you just wanted to see if it was possible after your <a href="https://twitter.com/porglezomp">colleague</a>â€™s offhand remark.</p>

<p>(For me, it was the last one, absolutely.)</p>

<p>This post is going to walk through what it took to make this possible, so hereâ€™s a table of contents:</p>

</ol>

<p>Sections 3-5 might actually be useful to other people looking to write Rust macros, so even though this project is a toy, you may still get something out of reading the post. However, if youâ€™re looking to use Objective-C from Rust in production, you should not be using my unsafe toy here. Instead, use Steven Sheldonâ€™s <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a>. Sheldon also has a blog post from near the start of the project that talks about <a href="https://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/">his design process beyond the bare message-send implementation</a>.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see the full source of my little monstrosity, you can <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/rust-inline-objc/">check out the repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-objective-c">Background on Objective-C</h2>

<p>My normal audience these days is probably Swift developers, but I expect this one to make rounds with at least some Rust people as well. Itâ€™d be easy for both groups to not have much direct experience with Objective-C, the primary language used by Apple for both macOS<sup id="fnref:osx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:osx">1</a></sup> and iOS since their releases in 2001 and 2007. So, hereâ€™s the quick summary: itâ€™s â€œjustâ€� C, except when you start working with â€œobjectâ€� types. And nearly everything you do with those objects is based on a dynamic dispatch model implemented in the <em>runtime.</em> Because of the two parts of that sentence (â€œdynamic dispatchâ€� and â€œimplemented in the runtimeâ€�), people have come up with a lot of clever and powerful techniques to make programs simpler, more expressive, or more extensible, though sometimes at the cost of security, secrecy, and stability.</p>

<p>More relevant to us, however, is that a language whose features are (nearly) all available in a runtime library is a language thatâ€™s easy to bridge to dynamically, as long as you donâ€™t have really tight performance constraints. So hereâ€™s the deal: nearly everything you do in Objective-C is calling methods by <em>sending messages,</em> and the way this works is that methods are regular C functions stored in a dispatch table keyed by a uniqued string called a <dfn>selector</dfn>. It is likely that the most heavily-optimized piece of code in Appleâ€™s libraries is <code>objc_msgSend</code>, which takes a <dfn>receiver</dfn>, a selector, and the arguments to the method, does a (cached) lookup of the selector in the receiverâ€™s classâ€™s dispatch table(s), and then jumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the method.</p>

<p>There are more things the Objective-C runtime exposes, but messages are absolutely the most important.</p>

<p>â€¦Oh, one more thing. Because Objective-C is an extension to C, it has to use syntax that doesnâ€™t conflict with C syntax. That means keywords with <code>@</code> signs in front of themâ€”one of the few symbols on the US keyboard that doesnâ€™t already have a meaning in Câ€”and a unique bracket-based â€œmessage sendâ€� syntax that takes a while to get used to:</p>

<pre><code>// Objective-C
NSString *fileStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:fileContents encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

// Pseudo-Swift
let fileStr: NSString = NSString.alloc().initWithData(fileContents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Actual Swift
let fileStr = NSString(data: fileContents, encoding: .utf8)

// Pseudo-Rust
let fileStr: *const NSString = NSString::alloc().initWithData(fileContents, NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Idiomatic-ish Rust
let file_str = NSString::from_data(file_contents, NSStringEncoding::UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>People almost universally think Objective-C syntax is ugly when they first see it, almost universally find it completely normal after a few years, and largely (though <em>not</em> almost universally) find idiomatic Swift easier to read even if theyâ€™re used to Objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="objective-c-from-rust-manually">Objective-C from Rust, manually</h2>

<p>From this point on youâ€™ll be expected to read Rust syntax without step-by-step explanations. Iâ€™ll try to explain whatâ€™s going on for my Swift and other non-Rust readersâ€”I myself am still a relative newcomer to Rustâ€”but itâ€™ll be pretty fast. This is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to Rust or Rust macros!</p>

<p>Given that the Objective-C runtime exposes a public API, we should be able to pretty much just call that from Rust, and indeed we can:</p>

<p>Now, this code should make most Rust users pretty horrified. It starts out okay, declaring some types and then declaring the Rust versions of the C API from libobjc. Then itâ€™s got a funny empty extern block to link the Foundation framework, but sure, thatâ€™s fine. And itâ€™s got explicitly-null-terminated strings because thatâ€™s what C-based APIs generally use. (Rust doesnâ€™t guarantee null termination by default, which makes slicing a Rust string easier.)</p>

<p>But then thereâ€™s a monstrosity of a line involving <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html"><code>std::mem::transmute</code></a>, Rustâ€™s equivalent of Swiftâ€™s <code>unsafeBitCast(_:)</code> or C++â€™s <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (and now <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast"><code>bit_cast</code></a>) or Câ€™sâ€¦well, okay, C doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent, but a plain old cast when youâ€™re talking about function pointers like this. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html">docs for <code>transmute</code></a> even tell you to go use other things if possible.</p>

<p>So, what are we doing? Well, remember what I said about Objective-C and <code>objc_msgSend</code>: methods are regular C functions, and <code>objc_msgSend</code> â€œjumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the methodâ€�. That means that the correct way to call <code>objc_msgSend</code> is to <em>pretend it has the right type for the method youâ€™re calling.</em></p>

<p>In C (and Swift, for that matter), that conversion would require explicitly specifying the type of all arguments and return values. But Rust has really powerful type inference within a function body, and that extends to specifying only <em>some</em> generic parameters, and leaving others out.<sup id="fnref:swift-inference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:swift-inference">2</a></sup> In this case I need to specify that weâ€™re casting to a C function pointer with two arguments and a non-void return, but not anything more than that. The remaining information will be filled in based on how the function pointer is used.</p>

<p>With that, you should understand the (cursed) code above. Go ahead. Try it on your own machine (if your machine is a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="recursive-rust-macros">Recursive Rust macros</h2>

<p>Rust has a pretty robust macro system, so it wouldnâ€™t be impossible or even too hard to make a macro for â€œmessage sendâ€�. Thatâ€™s the route that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a> takes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>url_class</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>NSURL</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>description_obj</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>url_class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>description</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>description_obj</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>UTF8String</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>CStr</span>::<span>from_ptr</span><span>(</span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span>).</span><span>to_string_lossy</span><span>());</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But while thatâ€™s clearly the right choice for serious Rust work, I wanted something more ambitious. More integrated. Moreâ€¦ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait a minute. this is just objective-c <a href="https://t.co/dVQMYKKVTI">pic.twitter.com/dVQMYKKVTI</a></p>— Harlan Haskins (@harlanhaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/1133210047952015360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>What I wanted was for Objective-Câ€™s messaging syntax, or something like it, to be valid anywhere in Rust code. It didnâ€™t have to be exactly Objective-C, but I quickly realized the <em>advantage</em> of Objective-Câ€™s syntax: itâ€™s delimited, i.e. itâ€™s a self-contained expression that can be dropped into something larger without changing how that larger thing parses. (Thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s bracketed in C as well.) Within the brackets, thereâ€™s basically two forms:</p>

<pre><code>[receiver-expr no-arg-selector]
[receiver-expr selector-piece:arg-expr selector-piece:second-arg-expr...]
</code></pre>

<p>If I were <em>just</em> matching that, I could use Rustâ€™s original <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">pattern-matching macros</a>. But to take a whole block of code, and replace everything that looks like a message lock <em>in</em> that blockâ€¦well, it might be possible with pattern-matching and quite a bit of recursion, but itâ€™s going to be a lot easier to use <em><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/21/Procedural-Macros-in-Rust-2018.html">procedural macros</a>,</em> a Rust macro interface written in Rust and used as a compiler plugin.

	<p><img alt="SQUADS HAVE EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS" src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ancient.png"></p>
<p>Recent events&nbsp;have completely exposed the limits of individual agency, creating a powerful demand for squad-based forms of resiliency. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most recent of these social bonding agents: though we're <em>physically</em> distancing, <em>emotionally</em> we're getting closer. First priority when the virus dropped was securing your squad. The need for group coordination and decision-making soon followed.</p>
<p>But today's emerging culture of group cohesion is driven equally by the social and financial precarity of urban life. <em>Family are those we share space and rent with</em>. Priced out of tier-1 cities, individuals have banded together to survive a jobless market with no social safety net.</p>
<p>Squads are both a product of—and a response to—contemporary social atomization. The trope of "getting a place upstate" signifies young city-dwellers' desire for new kinds of squad-based homesteading. HOMESQUADING is a modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement">back-to-the-land movement</a>—swap Whole Earth-inspired post-war communes with post-internet surf clubs microblogging the virtues of cooperative housing, permaculture gardening, and solar-powered mesh networks.</p>
<p>Squad culture is the antithesis of neoliberal individualism. Millennials are healing from decades of irony poisoning, rediscovering what it's like to have generative, exploratory relationships with one another. Younger generations are already imbued with extremely powerful squad energy, equipped with formative experiences in Minecraft, DOTA 2, and Fortnite parties.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ngram.png" alt="Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of &quot;SQUAD&quot; discourse."></p>
<p>Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of "SQUAD" discourse.</p>
<p>Whether bound together for survival or for lols, the squads formed by today's crisis will be resilient. Distance is no longer a barrier with the closeness of network space—soon vital culture will be predominantly enacted by fictive kin. Group collaboration is now the strong default, putting squads at the center of social, cultural, and economic life. To paraphrase Bill Bishop: today people are born as individuals, and have to find their squad.</p>

<p>While ancient squads were brought together by the struggle for survival, always-on group communication sets the scene for contemporary squad culture. Group chats and adapted team workspaces create shared context and institutional memory. One necessary condition of the squad is this sense of <em>persistence</em>: co-presence and continuous availability to one another.</p>
<p>But the squad is more than a loose network of affiliations, it's a coherent body. A second prerequisite of squad formation is self-recognition. It's not you or me. It's <em>Us</em>. <em>We.</em> <em>Ours</em>. This pillar often follows from the first. Squads may start as one-off Telegram channels, but they soon become "The Group Chat," a metonym for the squad itself.</p>
<p>For the squad to understand itself as a whole, it maintains boundaries circumscribing strong group norms. Fuck a Dunbar number—the ideal squad count is no more than 12. How can you really be <em>present</em> with more than a dozen people? Small groups are crucial for tight coordination. A greater network may surround the squad, making it appear big and fuzzy from the outside. But for the core crew, an invisible circle binds and protects a space of group identity.</p>
<p>As SQUAD VIBES grow, so does the possibility of interdependence and resource sharing—social, emotional, financial. Trust brought by consistent socialization and self-recognition is a foundation for exploring what the squad is capable of together. SQUAD CULTURE has only just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvJ7yW7Y3RY">begun</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-theory.png" alt="Theory of the squad"></p>

<p>The pandemic flipped the script on sharing space IRL, but our newly domestic reality only brought to the physical world what was already extremely online. Originally conceived as series of linked documents, Web 2.0 mass productization turned the internet into a series of linked interiors.</p>
<p>Today's squads are expressions of digital locality and the new squad era forces us to reconsider the individuated logic of early social networks. Contrary to early visions of hypertext, the internet is not a singular World Wide Web, traversed by individuals. To be online today is to enter the global arena. Mass social media are hazardous PvP zones no one should traverse without team support.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network-groupings.png" alt="Network graph of twitter with people-based groupings"></p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network.png" alt="Network graph of twitter"></p>
<p>The Twitter subcultures shown above are only a sliver of an expansive social deep web. Beneath this fuzzy graph is SQUAD SPACE, the network of inner-zones where digital microcultures are born: group DMs, Discords, Slacks, Keybases. Memes forged in SQUAD SPACE bubble out into the "clearnet" above, pwning NPCs on the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">internet of beefs</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-spaces.png" alt="Evolution of squad spaces"></p>
<p>Squad culture is downstream of squad space, and the digital places squads inhabit are only getting more advanced. The Discord can suddenly be on calls together. The Keybase can now use Git. <a href="https://subpixel.space/entries/come-for-the-network-pay-for-the-tool/">The team toolkit defines its capabilities</a>, and different platforms enable different modes of squad thought. Squad space is more than environment, it's a collective body, a shared cognition layer. Squad space is where market-moving trades are planned, conspiracies are conceived, and memes are spawned. Members of the squad may live in different geographies—but within this space, everyone is on SQUAD TIME. <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes/">The founding of a new group DM is year zero</a>.</p>
<p>Group dynamics ebb and flow with their environment, and nowhere more than SQUAD SPACE. Ecology calls this process “niche formation.” Online it's SQUAD CULTURE.</p>

<p>Inside the subterranean caves of the social deep web, chosen-kin groups grow their own culture. The squad doesn't need its own micro-currency—images, art, music, takes, shitposts, and, indeed, roasts are the native medium of exchange. Likewise squads have little use for internal financial incentives. Instead, playful exchanges produce trust, reciprocity, and VIBES—the ineffable group energy that squads value most. Accordingly, the core of squad production is the continuous production of the squad itself.</p>
<p>Evidenced by the power of crypto memetics, ragtag squads of shitposters have the power to define new forms of value based on their own esoteric social frameworks. Memeing produces "assets" that cannot be traditionally valued, but are capable of commanding cultural and economic movements.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-vibes.png" alt="Examples of squad vibes, including Twitch plays Pokemon, Chainlink $LINK Marines, Weird Sun Twitter, Brockhampton, Tik Tok Hype Houses, Theory of Vibe by Peli Grietzer, Bitcoin, and Headless Brands"></p>
<p>Memes, hot takes, internal language, 𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼... artifacts that can only be formulated as a group are the mainstay of squad production. The group exudes potent SQUAD VIBES, and vibes attract. Outsiders want to share the vibe—sometimes for the social capital, sometimes because the content produced is of strategic value, and always because the energy is infectious. After enough fire in the group DM, some squads begin to externalize their social products. Podcasting is obviously a squad technology. Rapid publishing turns memes into whitepapers, quickly flooding the marketplace of ideas with locally-grown squad humor.</p>
<p>Whether formed by necessity or chance, once together the squad's potential for creative production is immeasurable. <a href="https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview">VIBE</a> is an unstable substance of high informtion density. In formalizing their vibes, squads may accidentally give birth to <a href="https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/">headless brands</a>, virtual personalities, and pseudonymous entities they may not even be able to control. Thus the squad transitions from its youthful, entropic state, harnessing its vibes to create a source of unfathomable squad energy.</p>


<p>Group identity. Shared space. Vibes. These not only enable the creation of social capital, but strengthen the squad's capacity to organize, minimizing transaction costs and leading to greater productive capacities and resilience; this is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm">the nature of the squad</a>." But while squads can be viewed as a "nexus of contracts", unlike the Coasean firm, they are without legal structure. Social contracts are instead effected through the unspoken bonds of <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/the-vibes-theory-of-organisational-design-937a73f791cd">mutual respect and ingroup norms</a>.</p>
<p>But to sustain this solidarity economy the squad may look for ways to translate vibes into monetizable modes of public engagement: clients, subscribers, sponsors, music deals, yields. SQUAD PRODUCTION begins with the creation of processes and interfaces to convert creative labor into units that can be transmitted by global network participants. Here SQUAD TOOLS come into play. Vibes generated at the DAW, on the Figma board, or in the gaming lobby are turned consumable cultural instruments. Then it's just a matter of distribution. Young artists create online galleries and independent labels because they allow groups to interact (and transact) with the world through familiar organizational patterns. Bandcamps, Twitch pages, DAOs are public APIs for squads to interact with entities beyond their trust boundary.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-trust-stream.png" alt="Example of a Twitch stream from Berlin-based Trust (squad)"></p>
<p>Some digital tools are public interfaces, while others are used to coordinate internally. Today this SQUAD INFRASTRUCTURE is comprised of simple software primitives: Venmo, Splitwise, Cash App. These apps are financial plumbing that facilitate internal coordination between squad members by minimizing the awkwardness of asking your friends for money. Despite the strong demand for SQUAD RESILIENCY, the social stigma of group finances is still a major barrier to economic exchange among friends.</p>
<p>In-app mechanics like budget trackers, polls, and coin-flips offer a half-way point between social agreements and technical solutions. For instance Splitwise relies heavily on the social norms to ensure expenses are entered accurately. By allowing individuals to opt-in to a set of rules for retroactive settlement the group's social friction and coordination costs are reduced. Civilization advances by extending the number of important functions squads can perform without thinking.</p>
<p>Some believe new software can liberate "individual creators." But this kind of thinking inevitably leads to Uberized platform-mediated wage labor. We want to liberate squads. <em>The <strong>group</strong> is the basic user class for the tools we need today as a society, yet few pieces of software allow the squad as a whole to produce cooperatively and generate wealth together</em>. To fully realize SQUAD CULTURE this must change.</p>

<p>The other day I watched “See” on Apple TV+. The premise of the show is that after some apocalyptic event, humanity has lost its sense of sight and all humans are born blind. I quite enjoyed watching it but I can’t say I care much whether it gets extended for another season.</p>

<p>Anyway, one thing they do in the show is tie knots in strings and ropes to communicate. People trace the strings with their fingers, reading them like books. The system is never explained in much detail but people in the show are able to send messages that way. I thought this was a very cool idea and started thinking about how to design a system like that.</p>

<p>Initially, I considered a knot-based morse code with either two types of knots or the presence/absence of one type of knot to represent dots and dashes. Since that would mean up to five knots per letter, however, and I wanted to keep the number of knots as low as possible, I decided to come up with my own encodings of the Latin alphabet. To keep things simple, I used a fixed number of knots per letter.</p>

<p>Given these constraints, I had to decide how many different types of knots my system would be based on. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, the only numbers that make sense are 2, 3 and 6. Two types of knots require five knots per letter, three types require three knots and six types require two.</p>

<p>My last major contact with the world of knots was as a young boy on vacation with my parents at the North Sea coast, learning about knots used on fishing ships. Since I don’t remember much about those knots, I hit google to see what was on offer. Turns out that (like for everything in this world) there is a community of knotters online.</p>

<p>To be suitable for this projects, the knots had to fulfil the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Distinctiveness</strong>: they had to be distinct to the touch so that the “reader” could tell them apart without needing a sense of sight.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull resistance</strong>: I’m sure there’s a term of art for this in professional knot tying. The knots should not come undone when pulling on opposite ends of the string.</li>
  <li><strong>Placability</strong>: choosing a location on the string and placing the knot there should be easy. This is probably true for all knots with sufficient practice but it’s easier for some than for others.</li>
  <li><strong>Locality</strong>: it should be possible to tie the knot without having to pull through one end of the string. Turns out there’s a phrase for this, knots of this kind are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_%28knot%29%23In_the_bight">tied in the bight</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/test-knots2.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Testing different knots. Turns out twisted twine is not ideal for tying knots.</em></p>

<p>After an evening of playing around with different knots, these are the ones I ended up choosing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhand_knot"><strong>Overhand</strong></a>: this is the most fundamental knot and my go-to to tie anything together.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_loop"><strong>Butterfly</strong></a>: this knot creates a nice distinctive loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 1</strong>: this is what I called a butterfly knot with an additional overhand knot in the loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 2</strong>: same as above but with two overhand knots.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.101knots.com/barrel-knot.html"><strong>Barrel</strong></a>: this knot creates barrel along the string.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_figure-eight_loop"><strong>Double figure-eight</strong></a>: a knot that forms two loops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Six knots with two knots per character give us 6^2 = 36 possible combinations which is exactly what we need for 26 letters and 10 digits (no spaces or lowercase letters exist in this encoding). One optimisation I made in mapping these combinations to the different letters and digits was to assign each knot a difficulty value (turns out I was pretty off in my guesses of how difficult each knot would be to tie). Each possible combination of two knots then had a combined difficulty equal to the sum of the difficulties of each constituent knot. I assigned the letters in order of frequency such that the most frequent letters would be easiest to tie, the remaining ten combinations I assigned to the ten digits at random. This is the mapping I ended up with:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/mapping.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Mapping knots to letters &amp; digits.</em></p>

<p>Reading about knots online, I discovered that paracord is the medium of choice for people who pursue this hobby. I got some and it is a much more pleasurable experience to tie with compared to the cheap twine I was using before. Another purchase I made was what seems to be the authoritative source on knots: The Ashley Book of Knots. I have only skimmed the book so far but if I ever make a version two of the speaking knots, I’m certain it will be a repository of possible knots to integrate into any future encoding.</p>

<p>After tying a few one letter strings, I eventually tied this seven meter beast:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/human-rights.jpg" alt="human-rights">
<em>“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”</em></p>

<p>After trying out the system, here are some things I learned about the different knots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overhand</strong>: the fact that this is not tied in the bight makes this much more annoying to tie than I first thought. I would not include this knot again for this reason.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly</strong>: this knot and its variants are perfectly suited for this project and don’t have any downsides.</li>
  <li><strong>Barrel</strong>: this knot is aesthetically pleasing but not only is it not tied in the bight, it needs three pull-throughs to be completed! There does seem to be a variant of it that doesn’t have this downside but I haven’t played with it yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Double figure-eight</strong>: this knot works but it wastes a lot of string and has a very thick main part that the two loops grow out of. It’s also hard to distinguish from the butterfly by touch alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>I might decide to spend more time on this project in the future but for now, I’m happy with how much fun I’ve already had with it. If I do, these are some ideas for possibly improvements and additions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different knots/different mapping based on what I learned about the knots I chose.</li>
  <li>Some way of preventing the reader to get out of sync with which pairs on the string form the letters. If either the author or the reader of the message accidentally skip one knot, the message ends up garbled. This isn’t a big issue since when that happens, all that’s required is to shift one knot and try again.</li>
  <li>Single knots for common letters or even words to speed up the tying process. This would also help with synchronisation.</li>
  <li>Some way of indicating the direction a string is meant to be read in. Maybe a bead tied into the string. I considered beads also as part of the encoding but decided against it so that no additional material would be needed to write a message.</li>
  <li>Splicing together pieces of string. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_knot">blood knot</a> should make this possible. Since it looks very similar to the barrel knot that’s part of the current encoding, I would probably have to choose between the two. This could indicate a space. Assembling longer messages from multiple pieces of string would also somewhat solve the problem of having to tie knots that are not died in the bight in long pieces of string.</li>
  <li>The distance between two knots could be integrated into the encoding and assigned some significance.</li>
  <li>Maybe some completely different way of encoding meaning that isn’t based on the Latin alphabet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand">Shorthand</a> could be a possible source of inspiration for a writing system that is designed for speed. Googling for similar ideas, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu">Quipu</a> system used by the Inca people. I couldn’t find much about how specifically it worked and maybe that knowledge isn’t extant but it would be cool to learn more about it.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the beginning of this year, I joined <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank"><strong>On Deck</strong></a> – a fellowship of entrepreneurs at various stages of launching their startups – with the goal of expanding my professional network in the Bay Area and finding a co-founder for my next venture.</p><p>‍</p><p>On Deck was designed as a 10-week onsite program, with social events such as weekend trips, lunches, etc. However, no one had anticipated a global pandemic to strike, and On Deck had to switch to fully remote operations even before the group had a chance to meet in person.</p><p>‍</p><p>The decision to continue as a remote program came a few weeks before the cohort start date. By then, I have already flown into San Francisco, rented a place, and was testing several startup ideas.

All the dinners, parties and team bonding activities I was looking forward to have been replaced with Slack chats and Zoom calls.</p><p>‍</p><p>In retrospect, it is incredible how quickly On Deck managed to reorganize the entire curriculum into a fully-remote event.

We were split into groups and played icebreaker games. Through introductions, games, and breakout activities, we got to know everyone in the cohort.</p><p>‍</p><p>Without us knowing at the time, our groups were not random. On Deck evaluated the participants and thoughtfully paired those with complementary skills together. Therefore, it was not entirely coincidental that the first person I spoke to that day became my co-founder (months later). Job well done On Deck!</p><p>‍</p><p>What followed was 10 weeks of diverse activities:</p><ul role="list"><li>Breakout sessions</li><li>Hackathons</li><li>Speed dating</li><li>1:1 meetings</li><li>Virtual dinners</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>The breakout sessions were a dream come true – imagine the cool founders you follow on Twitter all appearing in your calendar: <a href="https://twitter.com/julialipton" target="_blank"><strong>Julia Lipton</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover" target="_blank"><strong>Ryan Hoover</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vhmth" target="_blank"><strong>Vinay Hiremath</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasklinger" target="_blank"><strong>Andreas Klinger</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33" target="_blank"><strong>Elizabeth Yin</strong></a>, and so on. You are free to select topics that are relevant or of interest to you to attend. Each session has around 10 participants, so there are ample opportunities to ask questions and interact with the speaker.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img alt="Snack was built for an ODF hackathon." src="https://assets.website-files.com/5df35853014f242fc4ae89f1/5f47e314a1a0eae8151bf231_snack-call.jpeg"></p><figcaption>(Snack was built for an ODF hackathon)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Meanwhile, hackathons allowed groups to work together and demonstrate their strengths.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="4cd9">When you are building Kubernetes applications, itâ€™s easy to end up in with â€œauthentication sprawlâ€� where all of your services have different authentication mechanisms. This tutorial walks through how to centralize your authentication mechanisms using an IdP and an API gateway.</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://blog.getambassador.io/@alex_gervais?source=post_page-----d509ffbc7b6f----------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Alex Gervais" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*qrt6AVoODoXwvJUGbeuv0w.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="dcd5"><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak</a> is a widely adopted Identity and Access Management (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IAM for short</a>) open-source solution. 2014 was a big year for groundbreaking technologies as both the Keycloak and Kubernetes projects were initially released a few weeks apart. Unsurprisingly, many Kubernetes end-users are turning to Keycloak as the preferred way to manage access to the secure APIs and services of their platform.</p><p id="3311">Simply running Keycloak in Kubernetes wonâ€™t however make your platform secure. A lot of concerns are left to the user to configure and implement: from exposing the Keycloak API endpoints using TLS and an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingress-controller</a>, to enforcing security policies on specific business endpoints. When solving these problems, we have a bias towards using an API Gateway solution to handle encrypted connections and centralize API management policies instead of re-implementing authentication strategies in every language and application of your microservice architecture.</p><p id="a6b3">Our goal today will be to install Keycloak as our IAM solution and secure it behind the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Edge Stack</a>, our API Gateway acting as a Kubernetes ingress controller. As a final step, we will deploy a sample application and demonstrate how to use Keycloak as an Identity provider (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/idp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IdP for short</a>) to restrict access to this application with OAuth2 using request Filters.</p><p id="0895">In this tutorial, we will use a non-production-ready Keycloak installation. To simplify our dependency graph, weâ€™ll use the in-memory datastore, which is totally suitable for a demo but wouldnâ€™t guarantee high-availability in a production environment. If you are looking for production-grade persistence, <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#_database" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak offers a variety of storage solutions</a>.</p><p id="eedf">The ingress controller is the missing building block in most Kubernetes offerings. Although Kubernetes defines an Ingress resource, it is not actually backed by any implementation that will turn the resource into a public service! The choice and installation of an ingress solution are left to the operator. Here, we will use the community version of the Ambassador Edge Stack, because of its direct integration with Keycloak for authentication, to expose and secure public traffic coming in from internet requests to downstream private services running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="c455">At the end of the tutorial, weâ€™ll be up and running with the Ambassador Edge Stack doing TLS termination at the edge of the Kubernetes network, exposing our Keycloak installation under <code>/auth/</code> and securing our Quote application under <code>/backend/</code>.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1496/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png" width="748" height="520" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="4461">Scaffolding with the K8s Initializer</h2><p id="0bfb">Kubernetes is often made fun of because of the copious amounts of YAML required. Instead of going into a scavenger hunt for YAML samples and assembling all puzzle pieces together from stale sources, weâ€™ll be using the <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K8s Initializer</a> to generate all of the Kubernetes resources for us. The K8s Initializer is a project generator tool similar to what exists for application developers: think Spring Initializr or Yeoman.</p><p id="0d5d">The wizard-like interface of the K8s Initializer will guide us through a few questions to understand and configure specific settings that vary from one cloud provider to the other. These implementation details are often where promises are broken and portability falls short, making it hard to configure ingress controllers and expose services to public traffic. Hopefully, we can do away with the little gotchas by using a comprehensive tool like the K8s Initializer who will provide us with an optimal configuration.</p><p id="b086">Specifically for this tutorial, we picked our target Kubernetes cluster: â€œGoogle Kubernetes Engineâ€� with a â€œGoogle External Load Balancer (L4)â€� load balancer. We also chose a public Hostname for our installation. Using a public hostname will require an extra step to configure a DNS entry to point to our installation, but given we want to demonstrate how to build a public secure application stack, itâ€™s worth the extra effort. As for the K8s Initializerâ€™s Auth configuration, we undoubtedly selected Keycloak, with a temporary password.</p><p id="8d03">Once satisfied with our K8s Initializer options, we hit the â€œdownloadâ€� button. Weâ€™ll be given a set of ready-to-go YAML files and instructions.</p><p id="21d8">Give it a try! <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://app.getambassador.io/</a></p><h2 id="56e8">Installing the Ambassador Edge Stack</h2><p id="fad2">Weâ€™ll start by installing the Ambassador Edge Stack simply because it contains a bunch of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions</a> dependencies. Given you have access to your desired Kubernetes cluster, the installation will be as simple as running <code>kubectl apply</code> commands and configuring a DNS entry to point to the external IP of the provisioned service.</p><h2 id="d5bb">Installing Keycloak</h2><p id="4d13">Installing Keycloak from the generated YAML is again straightforward: a single <code>kubectl apply</code> command. One curious cat might peek at the Keycloak YAML file, donâ€™t worry it wonâ€™t kill you! Youâ€™ll actually be able to appreciate how the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/using/intro-mappings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Mapping</a> resource will instruct traffic hitting the public <code>/auth/</code> prefix endpoint to be forwarded to our private Keycloak pod running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="f8e2">Giving Keycloak a few minutes to start, weâ€™ll then be able to access itâ€™s UI at <a href="https://domain-name/auth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://domain-name/auth/</a>. Since we chose to let â€œ<em>Ambassador terminate TLS using a Letâ€™s Encrypt certificateâ€�</em> in the K8s Initializer options, we can appreciate how automatic TLS termination is happening with a secure certificate for our Keycloak installation.</p><p id="e690">We can then log in to Keycloakâ€™s Administration Console UI using the default <code>admin</code> username and the temporary password weâ€™ve selected previously to configure Keycloak to our needsâ€¦ and change the password!</p><h2 id="befa">Configuring a Keycloak Realm, Client and User</h2><p id="a442">To secure our APIs, we will be using our shiny new Keycloak installation as our IdP. We first need to create a client to handle authentication requests from Ambassador Edge Stack. All of these configuration steps can be achieved using the Keycloak UI.</p><ol><li id="06c0">We first start by creating a new â€œRealmâ€�. Hovering on top of the â€œMasterâ€� label in the right-hand navigation, we can click on â€œAdd realmâ€�. We picked <code>ambassador</code> as the â€œNameâ€� of our new realm. This will be needed later on to configure the <code>authorizationURL</code> field in the auth Filter.</li><li id="6e10">Weâ€™ll create a new client by navigating to â€œClientsâ€� and clicking â€œCreateâ€�. We chose the following settings: <br>- <em>Client ID</em>: <code>ambassador</code> â€” This value will be used in the <code>clientID</code> field of the auth Filter.<br>- <em>Client Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Root URL</em>: None, left blank</li><li id="5859">On the following screen, we configured the Client with:<br>- <em>Access Type</em>: <code>confidential</code><br>- <em>Valid Redirect URIs</em>: <code>*</code></li><li id="2392">Navigating to the â€œMappersâ€� tab in our Client, we clicked â€œCreateâ€� and used the following settings:<br>- <em>Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Name</em>: <code>Ambassador Mapper</code><br>- <em>Mapper Type</em>: <code>Audience</code><br>- <em>Included Client Audience</em>: Select the name of the Client from the dropdown. Remember, we named our Client <code>ambassador</code>.</li><li id="cde8">Going back to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we navigated to the â€œClient Scopesâ€� section and configured our Client for <code>offline_access</code>.</li><li id="6c77">Back again to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we then navigated to the â€œCredentialsâ€� section. We took note of the â€œSecretâ€� value as it will be used later when configuring our auth Filter.</li></ol><p id="aeec">Along with our Client configuration, letâ€™s configure a Keycloak â€œUserâ€�:</p><ol><li id="2481">Navigating to the â€œUsersâ€� section of the Keycloak Administration Console, we will click on â€œAdd userâ€�. We gave our user a simple username: <code>my-keycloak-user</code>, then clicked â€œSaveâ€�.</li><li id="c77c">On the following screen, we switched to the Userâ€™s â€œCredentialsâ€� tab to set a temporary password.</li></ol><p id="b25e">Now that we have a user with which we are able to authenticate ourselves with, letâ€™s deploy an application.</p><h2 id="49f6">Deploying a Quote service</h2><p id="902c">Deploying custom applications on Kubernetes is achieved by creating some Kubernetes resources defined asâ€¦ You guessed it, more YAML! This time, since we are deploying a sample backend application, the sample is somewhat lightweight. You can save the following definitions to a â€œquote-service.yamlâ€� file and deploy it using <code>kubectl apply -f quote-service.yaml</code>.</p><pre><span id="4f23">---<br>apiVersion: v1<br>kind: Service<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  ports:<br>  - name: http<br>    port: 80<br>    targetPort: 8080<br>  selector:<br>    app: quote<br>---<br>apiVersion: apps/v1<br>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  replicas: 1<br>  selector:<br>    matchLabels:<br>      app: quote<br>  strategy:<br>    type: RollingUpdate<br>  template:<br>    metadata:<br>      labels:<br>        app: quote<br>    spec:<br>      containers:<br>      - name: backend<br>        image: docker.io/datawire/quote:0.4.1<br>        ports:<br>        - name: http<br>          containerPort: 8080<br>---<br>apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2<br>kind: Mapping<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote-backend<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  prefix: /backend/<br>  service: quote</span></pre><p id="c66d">This will create a Kubernetes <code>Deployment</code>, <code>Service</code>, and <code>Mapping</code> to publicly expose our running Quote application under the <code>/backend/</code> path. Give it a try, itâ€™s currently unprotected: <a href="https://domain-name/backend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://domain-name/backend/</a>.</p><h2 id="dbb3">Securing access</h2><p id="1525">Building on the configurations we applied to our Keycloak installation in the â€œConfiguring a Keycloak Realm, Client and Userâ€� section earlier, weâ€™ll be creating an OAuth2 <code>Filter</code> and <code>FilterPolicy</code> resources in Kubernetes. Donâ€™t forget to replace the placeholders in this YAML sample with the values from your installation! Once again, save the following definitions to a â€œkeycloak-filter.yamlâ€� file and deploy it using <code>kubectl apply -f keycloak-filter.yaml</code>.</p><pre><span id="31c3">---<br>apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2<br>kind: Filter<br>metadata:<br>  name: keycloak-filter<br>  namespace: ambassador<br>spec:<br>  OAuth2:<br>    authorizationURL: https://{domain-name}/auth/realms/ambassador<br>    audience: ambassador<br>    clientID: ambassador<br>    secret: {client_secret}<br>    protectedOrigins:<br>    …</span></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Firefox 80 and my confusion over its hardware accelerated video on Linux</h2>

	<p><small>August 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The news of the time interval is that Firefox 80 is out and in
theory it can support hardware video acceleration on X11, not just
Wayland (<a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/08/firefox-80-release-linux-gpu-acceleration">source</a>,
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Firefox-80-Released">also</a>).
The master Mozilla tracking bug for hardware accelerated video on
X11 is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>, with all
sorts of information. So I downloaded the official release (one of
my Firefox setups uses the official builds these days for reasons
beyond the scope of this entry) and tried to get it to do accelerated
video playback. The short version is that I think I've failed, but I'm
not sure why.</p>

<p>Even in Firefox 80, getting VA-API accelerated video playback
requires a whole series of magic incantations in <code>about:config</code>
preferences and perhaps environment variables when you start Firefox
(this may change in the next release). Assuming that all of those
are set right, Firefox can apparently still decide that it doesn't
like your Linux video driver (or its version), your specific hardware,
or perhaps either or both of the resolution of the source video and
the resolution of your display. Some or many of these can be forced
with Firefox settings, but at the same time the bug reports I've
read say that sometimes Firefox ignores hardware acceleration because
it's slower for the specific circumstances, or because it has known
bugs. If Firefox is making a sensible decision for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/HomeMachine2018">my specific
hardware</a>, that's one thing and I want
it to do what will work best. But if I've missed a setting or if
Firefox is just being twitchy about something, I also want to
override it. In general I know my hardware is capable of hardware
accelerated playback of videos at far lower CPU usage than Firefox
manages (on the same videos).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Firefox won't tell me what it's doing or why, at
least not in a way that I can understand. I've peered into the
depths of <code>about:support</code>, which tells me some of the 'what' but
not the 'why', and I've tried some of the things from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>
without success. If Firefox is or isn't going to do hardware
accelerated video playback, I wish it would tell me both what it was
doing and why. Otherwise I'm probably going to go on being confused
and annoyed with it.</p>

<p>(I care about hardware acceleration not just because of CPU load
but because my perception is that hardware acceleration is necessary
to play back a full sized video smoothly without dropping frames
every so often. This may be wrong on modern hardware, even on my 4k
display.)</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is quite verbose! Worse, it’s error prone and annoying to type every
time.</p>

<p>To remedy this problem <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton">Quinn Wilton</a> has
added the record update syntax to Gleam, so now we only need to specify the
fields that change.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>level_up</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>:</span> <span>Pokemon</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_level</span> <span>=</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.level</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_moves</span> <span>=</span> <span>moves_for</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span> <span>new_level</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Pokemon</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>pokemon</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>new_level</span><span>,</span> <span>moves</span><span>:</span> <span>new_moves</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All data in Gleam is immutable, so this syntax does not alter the values of
the existing record, instead it creates a new record with the original values
and the updated values.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomwhatmore">Tom Whatmore</a> has added some new features to
Gleam’s numbers.</p>

<p>There’s now syntaxes for binary, octal, and hexadecimal int literals.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 4 ways of writing the int 15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hexadecimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xF</span>
<span>let</span> <span>decimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>octal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>o17</span>
<span>let</span> <span>binary</span> <span>=</span> <span>0b00001111</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These might be handy in many situations such as when implementing
<a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/gleam-chip8">a virtual machine</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lpil/tetromino">a game of tetris</a> in Gleam.</p>

<p>Underscores can now be added to numbers, making larger numbers easier to read.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>billion</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000</span>
<span>let</span> <span>trillion_and_change</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000_000</span><span>.</span><span>57</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="type-holes">Type holes</h2>

<p>Type holes can be used to give partial annotations to values.</p>

<p>Here we’re saying that <code>x</code> is a List, but we’re not saying what type the list
contains, leaving the compiler to infer it.</p>



<p>This may be useful when adding annotations for documentation or to use a more
restrictive type than would be inferred by the compiler, as you can leave out
any parts of the annotation that are not important to you there.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-improvements">Compiler improvements</h2>

<p>The majority of the compiler work in this release has been improvements to
existing features.</p>

<p>The formatter style has been improved in several ways, and the performance of
the formatter has been improved. One popular change is to how it formats
assignments that don’t fit on a single line.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Before</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>
  <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>session</span><span>),</span>
<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>application_registry</span><span>.get_session</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.user_id</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Now</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>session</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>application_registry</span><span>.get_session</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.user_id</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much better!</p>

<p>Additionally several error messages have been improved to include more
information on how to fix the problem, and a whole bunch of bug have been
squashed. Please see the
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for
more detail.</p>

<h2 id="http">HTTP</h2>

<p>Outside of the compiler the big new thing in Gleam is the first release of
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http">Gleam HTTP</a>. Inspired by existing libraries such as Ruby’s Rack,
Elixir’s Raxx, and Haskell’s WAI, Gleam HTTP provides a single well-typed
interface for creating web applications and clients while keeping the
underlying HTTP client and server code modular.</p>

<p>In Gleam a HTTP service is a regular function that takes a HTTP request and
returns a HTTP response, where request and response are types defined by the
HTTP library.</p>

<h4 id="services">Services</h4>

<p>Here’s a simplistic service that echoes back any body sent to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>Request</span><span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>echo_service</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Request</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.response</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_resp_body</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.body</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a normal Gleam function it is easy to test this service, no special test
helpers or test server are required.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>should</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>echo_test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.default_req</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_req_body</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>my_app</span><span>.service</span>

  <span>response</span><span>.status</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>should</span><span>.equal</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>

  <span>response</span><span>.body</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>should</span><span>.equal</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gleam’s HTTP library also provides middleware, which can be used to add
additional functionality to a HTTP service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>bit_builder</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>middleware</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>service</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>my_app</span><span>.echo_service</span>
  <span>// Add a header</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.prepend_resp_header</span><span>(</span><span>"made-with"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Gleam"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>// Convert the response body type</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.map_resp_body</span><span>(</span><span>bit_builder</span><span>.from_bit_string</span><span>)</span>
  <span>// Support PATCH, PUT, and DELETE from browsers</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.method_override</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="running-a-service">Running a service</h4>

<p>Once we have defined a service we want to run the service with a web server so
that it can handle HTTP requests from the outside world. To do this we use a
HTTP server adapter, such as one for the <a href="https://github.com/elli-lib/elli">Elli Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>elli</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>elli</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>my_app</span><span>.service</span><span>,</span> <span>on_port</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or one for the <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">Cowboy Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>cowboy</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>cowboy</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>my_app</span><span>.service</span><span>,</span> <span>on_port</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or even using the adapter for the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug">Elixir’s Plug interface</a>, so that a
Gleam HTTP service can be mounted within an Elixir Phoenix web application.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyAppWeb</span><span>.</span><span>UserController</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>MyAppWeb</span><span>,</span> <span>:controller</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>conn</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>GleamPlug</span><span>.</span><span>call_service</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>:my_app</span><span>.</span><span>service</span><span>/</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A list of all available server adapters can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http/#server-adapters">Gleam HTTP
project’s README</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to see more examples of Gleam HTTP being used to create a
web application see the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/example-echo-server">echo server</a> on GitHub. It
includes all the above as well as other concepts such as routing and logging.</p>

<h4 id="http-clients">HTTP clients</h4>

<p>HTTP services are only half the story! We also can use the HTTP library to
make out own requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>httpc</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_my_ip</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.default_req</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_method</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>.Get</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_host</span><span>(</span><span>"api.ipify.org"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>httpc</span><span>.send</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>.body</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we’ve build a HTTP request and sent it using the <code>httpc</code> client adapter,
returning the response body if the request is successful.</p>

<p>A list of all available client adapters can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http/#client-adapters">Gleam HTTP
project’s README</a>.</p>

I am many things: Husband, Father, Designer, Developer, Entrepreneur, and Interior House Painter to name a few. My wife and I have been married since 2016 and have two boys (10 and 12). We live in Castle Rock Colorado, which is located about 30 minutes South of Denver. I am originally from Iowa, have lived in Minnesota, and of course now Colorado.</p><p>I have two degrees, one in design and another in 3D Animation. I have also studied computer science, photography, pottery, and grew up helping my dad build and remodel things. <em>(He is a carpenter/cabinet builder.)</em></p><p>In September of 2018, I stepped away from my design and development career and started my own interior house painting company which has continued to be extremely successful and continues to grow. In my free time, I focus on my own personal, digital products to relax and hopefully, one day will be my primary focus and revenue source.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-making">What are you making?</h2><p>As many people know, I make a lot of things, of which you can check out here: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.krazier.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RVfOCL3YgTIhIkAVAXbe8">https://www.krazier.com</a> but the one I spend a lot of my time on and has been growing the fastest is Retrospect. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.retrospect.team&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw18nsSYhG0Y9pINGNtWMKO0">https://www.retrospect.team</a></p><p>Retrospect is a real-time collaboration tool for retrospectives, tasks, and ideas.</p><h2 id="how-did-the-idea-for-your-product-come-to-mind">How did the idea for your product come to mind?</h2><p>I was working for a company a couple of years ago and we needed a tool to do retrospectives and the existing solutions we found were not designed well and didnâ€™t work all that great, not to mention the bigger solutions costing a lot of money to use for a relatively small need that we had. I set out to build a simple, affordable solution that looked good too.</p><h2 id="what-inspired-you-to-make-your-product">What inspired you to make your product?</h2><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wmkyhgs67HaZAalvciwqT6cj56V3OKmQQdK9SojC05r4XwoelQxx7YjFCk3t_Hst_HHV7-yXuXpD8FqWziizHUeAMW6T-BTTbfeGwVC8m2p-iNoaXEsFipWMuIoytQ"><figcaption>Retrospect.</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned above, it was originally out of necessity, but it is become a bit of a passion project to see just how far I can take it. With the Covid19 lockdown situation, this type of tool has only become more important for businesses to take advantage of.</p><p>Retrospect is purposefully â€œsimpleâ€�, we did not set out to make another Trello or Asana type of tool. Those tools are great and are a nice compliment to what we are building. One important focus for us has been â€œanonymityâ€� in the product. With Retrospectives, it is important to be able to provide critical feedback, it can be hard to do that if there is the potential for your co-workers to get upset with something you may have said. With Retrospect, everything you publish to a board is kept anonymous so that you can give that critical feedback without fear of retaliation.</p><p>Retrospect will always be affordable; we want this service to be approachable to as many people as possible while still being worth our time financially. We provide great pricing and a great solution and hope people will recognize that and find value in what we offer.</p><blockquote>I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</blockquote><h2 id="why-embark-on-the-maker-s-journey">Why embark on the makerâ€™s journey?</h2><p>I have always enjoyed building things, from Legos and plastic models to do-it-yourself projects around the house and of course digital designs and products. We live in a world that is very digital and very accessible for anyone to learn to design or code their own software. With tools like Makerlog, we can now share our progress, connect with other makers, and build things together. By nature, building software is often an â€œindividualâ€� thing to do, so having resources to connect with others makes the journey a lot more fun and open to learning from so many types of people.</p><p>A lot of people have a bit of an ambition to make something, whether it is art, electronics, gardening, woodworking, jewelry, or software. It is a way for us to get away from the day-to-day requirements in our lives and focus on something that we love to do without the stress of having to do it for anyone else. I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-see-the-future-of-your-product">How do you see the future of your product?</h2><p>Retrospect has come a long way since the initial launch about two years ago, we have provided more permissions, more functionality, and improved the experience. The future has a lot of potential for new features and growth.</p><p>With the number of projects, I work on, I tend to push out a lot of smaller updates rather than huge feature releases. It is easier for us to manage and it also does not overwhelm our uses with huge UI changes that might make the tool unexpectedly harder for them to use.</p><p>As we continue to push out updates, our user audience will continue to expand. At first, our focus was on â€œretrospectivesâ€� which mostly development teams would find value in, the average person does not need a retrospective tool in their day-to-day lives. We are working towards making this a tool that has a useful impact on a daily level both professionally and personally. This means new types of functionality and a refreshed focus on our marketing and branding. Some of which will be happing over the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="as-of-today-what-are-your-stats">As of today, what are your stats?</h2><p>As of today, our stats areâ€¦</p><ul><li><strong>Users:</strong> 6,290</li><li><strong>Boards:</strong> 3,925</li><li><strong>Cards:</strong> 48,947</li><li><strong>Monthly Pageviews:</strong> 10K+</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $2K+ (We will be switching to a subscription model soon.)</li></ul><h2 id="how-do-you-use-makerlog">How do you use Makerlog?</h2><p>I post my daily updates but try to focus on important tasks rather than â€œI had a coffee todayâ€�, I do not want to spam the feed with things that are not important to know. I read most of the discussions and contribute when it makes sense.</p><p>I love Makerlog because it has allowed me to meet so many people that I never would have met any other way (other than maybe through Twitter).

The bigger, more obvious challenges are lack of motivation, lack of revenue, and plain old fear.</p><p>Motivation, as makers we are by default motivated to work on things, that is what makes us a maker in the first place. The challenge comes into play when you have been working on something for a long time and it just feels like it will never be completed. There is always that â€œone more thingâ€� to do, person to reach out to, reason not to go live. When you do almost everything yourself, you simply get exhausted and lack of motivation is inevitable. Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s a bad thing, it just means you need to learn how to renew that motivation to push forward. For me I like to go to or watch movies, it is one easy way for me to reset my mind and get back into thigs. I also like to clean my desk or house, make a list of every task I have, and then work through the easy ones as fast as possible since lack of motivation often comes from knowing you should be doing something else so you end up doing nothing at all. If you can get the easy things done, then it helps you get motivated again.</p><p>Lack of revenue, this is a devastating challenge to a lot of people. We often see those â€œovernight successâ€� stories, that usually are not overnight. Though, these days we are seeing a lot of people who will literally build something one day and have a lot of success the next, the question is how long-term is that success? The obvious goal of being a maker is to generate revenue so you can get away from that 9-5 job, the unobvious issue is that it can take years to get enough revenue to do that. A lot of people do not realize this fact and give up too early and go back to what they were doing before. We also canâ€™t â€œdo it allâ€� so we often have to hire some pieces out, if you have no revenue, this becomes a big burden and can literally prevent you from even finishing your project.</p><p>Fear, people have a lot of fear in their minds. It is an important thing to be aware of and work on as being maker means dealing with a lot of unknowns. Fear is a good motivator though; it can force you to learn something faster than you thought possible. When I first started launching products, I was scared to death. Now that I have launched so many projects, I barely stress out at all. It just comes with practice and experience to get over or at least manage your fears.</p><p>You are likely not able to cause too much damage with something you build, so go out and build something, launch it, and learn from it. The more you do it, the more interesting it becomes.</p><blockquote>The more you fail the more you learn.</blockquote><h2 id="managing-so-many-projects-how">Managing so many projects, how?</h2><p>As of right now, I have 11 public projects plus my day job, plus several new projects I am working on and my #MakerMillion journey. It looks like a lot, it is a lot, but it is not as crazy as it sounds.</p><p>Retrospect is my primary focus; I spend the most time on this project compared to any other one I have (outside of my day job). Everything else sort of just â€œruns itselfâ€�, I have very little time commitment reserved for them on a day-to-day basis. Yes, I work on them, but it is not a constant, urgent requirement. Some things I have not hardly touched in months, partly because I am focused on other things and partly because I just lose interest in them for a while.</p><p>I work in cycles and sprints, I will come up with a feature idea, work hard on it for a week or two, launch it and then move onto the next thing. I do this over and over across all my projects. If I tried to focus on one thing, for a long time, I would get super bored with it, I like having the ability to jump around. This approach very likely prevents me …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Bcrypt is a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">key derivation function</a>, which can be thought of as a slow <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a>. Its purpose is to <em>slowly</em> convert a piece of input data to a fixed-size, deterministic, and unpredictable output. A common use-case is to convert a password into an n-bit cryptographic key, which can then be used for safe authentication. </p>



<p>Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault,</a> we use Bcrypt in our security systems. Bcrypt is a very popular password hashing function, so much so that it’s the hash function we currently teach the implementation of in our <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Practical Cryptography</a> course.</p>



<h2>What Bcrypt Looks Like</h2>



<p>Using Bcrypt on the password <em>myPassword123</em> would produce something like the following:</p>



<pre><strong><em>myPassword123</em> </strong>-&gt;
$2y$12$vUw4OU4EAl4w4vC6/lA33OtDSYGhiIdekdT9iOoSs9/ckwrffaEui</pre>



<p>That output can be used to compare against future hashes against to see if the original data matches.</p>



<h2>Why not compare passwords directly?</h2>



<p>In web development,<em> </em>it is insecure to store user’s passwords in plain text. If an attacker were to gain access to the server’s database they could find raw email/password combinations and use them to attack the same users on other sites. </p>



<p>At the <em>very least</em> we must hash user’s passwords, but hash functions like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a> and MD5 are too fast to be secure. Using a KDF like Bcrypt provides security benefits over fast hashes because it is computationally expensive and slow. If an attacker gains access to a database of password hashes made with fast algorithms it is easy for them to “reverse” the hashes by guessing different inputs and seeing if the outputs match.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the attacker finds the following entry in a database:</p>



<pre>user@gmail.com 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p>They can try hashing common passwords like:</p>



<pre>password1 -&gt;
0b14d501a594442a01c6859541bcb3e8164d183d32937b851835442f69d5c94e
password2 -&gt;
6cf615d5bcaac778352a8f1f3360d23f02f34ec182e259897fd6ce485d7870d4
password3 -&gt; 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p><br>The password, <code>password3</code>, produced a matching hash! Now the attacker knows that <code>user@gmail.com</code> is likely to use the password <code>password3</code> on other sites and can go hack other accounts. This is only possible because the attacker is able to quickly compute many hashes per second and guess millions of potential passwords.</p>



<p>A slow KDF like Bcrypt solves this problem.</p>



<h2>Bcrypt Output Format</h2>



<pre>$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy
\___/\__/\_____________________________/\___________________________________/
Alg   Cost                  Salt                                            Hash</pre>



<ul><li><code>2a</code>: The hash algorithm identifier (Bcrypt)</li><li><code>10</code>: Cost factor (2<sup><code>10</code></sup>&nbsp;= 1,024 rounds of key expansion)</li><li><code>N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMye</code>: 16-byte (128-bit) salt, base64 encoded to 22 characters</li><li><code>IjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy</code>: 24-byte (192-bit) hash, base64 encoded to 31 characters</li></ul>



<p>Direct from <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>



<h2>Bcrypt Explained Step by Step</h2>



<p>Bcrypt can be visualized with the following Go-like pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func bcrypt(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (hash string) {
	// Initialize Blowfish state with expensive key setup algorithm
	// This is the slow part of the algorithm
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes := expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost, salt, password)

	// Repeatedly encrypt the text "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt" 64 times
	// 24 bytes = three 64-bit blocks
	ctext := "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt"
	for i := 0; i &lt; 64; i++ {
		// Encrypt using standard Blowfish in ECB mode
		ctext = encryptECB(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, ctext)
	}

	// return the version, cost, salt, and ctext in the proper format
	return "$2a${cost}${salt}{ctext}"
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, Bcrypt depends heavily on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)" rel="noopener">Blowfish</a> cipher. Put simply, Bcrypt is an expensive key expansion coupled with Blowfish encryption.</p>



<p>The <code>expensiveBlowfishSetup</code> function can be understood by following pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">// pEighteenSubkeys: array of 18 subkeys
// sFourSubBoxes: Four substitution boxes
// Each S-Box is a 256-length array of uint32
func expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32) {
	// Initialize arrays
	pEighteenSubkeys := [18]uint32
	sFourSubBoxes := [4][256]uint32

	// Fill pEighteenSubkeys and sFourSubBoxes with the hex digits of pi 
	// This initial state works as in the original Blowfish algorithm
	// it populates the P-array and S-box entries with the fractional part of pi in hexadecimal
	pEighteenSubkeys = fillWithPi(pEighteenSubkeys)
	sFourSubBoxes = fillWithPi(sFourSubBoxes)

	// Permutate P and S based on the password and salt
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, salt, password)

	// This is the "Expensive" part of the "Expensive Key Setup"
	// Otherwise the key setup would be identical to Blowfish
	// Expand the key an exponentially increasing number of times
	// depending on the cost factor
	for i := 0; i &lt; math.Pow(2, cost); i++ {
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, password)
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, salt)
	}

	return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p><code>The expandKey function</code> is executed an exponentially increasing number of times depending on the value of the <code>cost</code> parameter. The <code>expandKey</code> function is explained by the following pseudo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (
	pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32
	) {

	// Mix password into the pEighteenSubkeys array
	// by XORing password with subkeys
	for i := 0; i &lt; 18; i++{
		// treat the password as cyclic, XOR 32 bit chunks of password with subkeys
		pEighteenSubkeys[i] ^= password[i % 18]
	}
 
   // Treat the 128-bit salt as two 64-bit halves 
   saltHalf[0] = salt[0:63]
   saltHalf[1] = salt[64:127]

   // Initialize an 8-byte (64-bit) buffer with all zeros.
   block := [8]byte

   // Mix internal state into P-boxes   
   for i := 0; i &lt; 9; i++ {
	  // XOR 64-bit block with a 64-bit salt half
	  // Each iteration alternating between saltHalf[0], and saltHalf[1]
      block ^= saltHalf[(i-1) mod 2]

	  // Encrypt block using current key schedule with blowfish block encryption
	  block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block)
	  
	  // Split block and use as new subkeys
      pEighteenSubkeys[2*i] = block[0:31]
	  pEighteenSubkeys[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
   }

   // Mix encrypted state into the internal S-boxes of state
   for i := 0; i &lt; 4; i ++ {
      for j := 0; j &lt; 127; j++ {
		// Encrypt block using blowfish block encryption
		// where salt[i] is 64 bit chunks
        block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block ^ salt[i])
        sFourSubBoxes[2*i] = block[0:31]
		sFourSubBoxes[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
	  }
	}
    return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p>It helps me to visualize the details of the pseudo-code by using a more “real” programming syntax like Go. If that doesn’t help you then take a look at the code on the <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Algorithm" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page here.</p>

        <p><em>The integral of the secant is well known to any beginners calculus student. Yet this integral was once a major outstanding maths problem. It was first introduced by Geradus Mercator, who needed it to make his famous map, in 1569. He couldn’t find it, and used an approximation instead. The exact solution was found accidently 86 years later without calculus in 1645. It then took another two decades until a formal proof was given in 1668, 99 years after Mercator first proposed the problem.</em></p>

<p>As this <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/how-math-works">comic</a> by SMBC rightly teases, the history of mathematics is often not so straightforward. 
Theorems, formulas and notation that are routinely discussed in class, were once insights or accidents themselves.
This is the story of one such formula, the integral of the secant. 
I first read about it almost a decade ago<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, when I got interested in cartography: the science and art of mapmaking. 
This integral is of vital importance to the Mercator map, and therefore many online maps that use it, like <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>.</p>

<p>This story has been told several times before: see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3603395">1</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> or <a href="https://scholarworks.umt.edu/tme/vol7/iss2/12/">3</a>.
But these are all journal articles, consigned mostly to academics.
I want to present it here in a less formal and more colourful setting, to make it more accessible.</p>

<p>This is an article about mathematics, so familiarity with the following is helpful: algebra, trigonometry, radians and basic calculus. 
These are usually covered in advanced high school maths classes or first year maths courses.</p>

<h2 id="first-year-maths">First year maths</h2>

<p>In first year maths at university, after a month of differentiation, we were starting the inverse problem: integration. 
Differentiation  is the mathematics of finding gradient functions for curves.
Integration is the mathematics of inverting this - given a gradient function, what is the curve? 
My lecturer was introducing the integration of trigonometric functions.
He started off with:</p><p>

\[\int sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + c \:\text{  and } \int cos(x) dx = sin(x) + c\]

</p><p>This relationship made sense, because sine and cosine derivatives were opposites. Just had to be careful of minus signs. Next he derived the integral for the tangent:</p><p>

\[\int tan(x) dx = \int \frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}dx = -ln|cos(x)| + c\]

</p><p>Ok, that was tricky. It was not immediately obvious that the inverse of the chain rule could be used here, because the function $cos(x)$ was present with its derivative $sin(x)$.
But given enough thought, it made sense. Then he said, this is the integral of the secant, and learn it off by heart:</p><p>

\[\int sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + c\]

</p><p>OK, where did that come from? My lecturer offered no explanation. It was easy to verify that it worked by finding the derivative. 
(Paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> has a more complex proof using only integration.)
But how had he come up with that?</p>

<p>I think, at this point, most first year calculus students like me have the following fleeting thoughts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Integration is much harder than differentiation.</li>
  <li>Some mathematician must have stumbled on this through differentiation first.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t matter anyway because where will I ever use this?</li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, number 1 is true, as many a student can testify after writing a test. 
Number 2 is false - in fact it was found by a teacher while looking at raw numbers. 
Such a method for finding an integral is so unusual, that one might conjecture it is the <em>only</em> integral that has been found like this.
Surely in calculus class, where raw numbers are so rare, you would be laughed at if you attempted to solve an integral like that.
Lastly, number 3 remains true for me. But this doesn’t mean this integral isn’t useful - it is used to construct the Mercator map. 
That is why a teacher was crunching numbers when he serendipitously realised what the formula was.</p>

</figure>

<p>The secant is a standard trigonometric function. It is defined as the ratio of the hypotenuse $c$ to the adjacent side $a$ for an angle $\varphi$ in a right angled triangle.
In mathematical notation, the definition is:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{c}{a}\]

</p><p>It is the reciprocal of the more widely used cosine function:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{1}{cos(\varphi)}\]

</p><p>Here are the graphs of the secant and cosine for the angles from $-2\pi$ (-360°) to $2\pi$ (360°):</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/secant_graph.png" alt="Definition of the secant">
</figure>

<p>The integral of the secant can be interpreted as the area under the graph<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is illustrated by the shaded region.</p>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-cartography">An introduction to cartography</h2>

<p>The earth, which is a sphere<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, cannot be projected onto a flat map without distortion. 
Over the years, cartographers have devised many different map projections which try to balance minimising distortion with other properties. 
They come in all shapes and sizes.
Lists of these projections can be found <a href="https://map-projections.net/singleview.php">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections">here</a>.
I will explain two of the simplest here, which will help with understanding the Mercator map in the next section.</p>

<p>All map projections can be represented as equations that transform spherical co-ordinates to flat map co-ordinates.
The co-ordinates on the sphere are the angles $\varphi$ and $\lambda$. These correspond to lines of latitude (parallels) and longitude (meridans) respectively. 
The co-ordinates on the flat map are $x$ and $y$. A map projection is therefore a transformation from $\varphi$ and $\lambda$ to $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>One of the simplest and oldest known projections is the equirectangular projection:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular.png" alt="Equirectangular map">
	<figcaption>Equirectangular map. From <a href="https://map-projections.net/single-view/rectang-0">map-projections.net/singleviewp/rectang-0</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is made by mapping meridians and parallels to vertical and horizontal straight lines of constant spacing.
This has the affect of stretching out objects along the parallels.
The equations for this projection are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= R\varphi\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>While the equations are simple, the construction process can be hard to visualise. Here is my attempt:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular_construction.png" alt="Equirectangular map construction">
	<figcaption>A segment of the sphere is peeled off and flattened.
The right most image shows a top view of the flattening. The arcs are pulled flat in the longitudial direction, so that they become straight lines.
They do not change length in this process, but that requires stretching out the sides along the $x$-axis. 
Thus a single point where all the arcs meet, is stretched into a line.   </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equirectangular map has a total area of $(2\pi R)(\pi R)=2\pi^2 R^2$ while the surface area of the sphere is $4\pi R^2$. 
Therefore this projection distorts the area by a factor of $\frac{\pi}{2}\approx1.57$.</p>

<p>A different kind of projection can be obtained by projecting lines from the sphere onto the mapping plane. 
An example is the Lambert cylindrical projection. 
It is made by wrapping a cylinder around the sphere and projecting points onto it via lines parallel to the $x$-axis. 
Here is a visualisation of this construction:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/Cilinderprojectie-constructie.jpg" alt="Lambert cylindrical map construction">
	<figcaption>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cilinderprojectie-constructie.jpg">Wikipedia</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And here is a cross section of the sphere along side the final map:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/Lambert_construction.png" alt="Lambert cylindrical  map">
	<figcaption>Lambert cylindrical  map. Edited from <a href="https://map-projections.net/single-view/lambert">map-projections.net/singleviewp/lambert</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equations are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= Rsin(\varphi)\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>For objects near the equator, this results in very little distortion, such as for Africa. But objects near the poles are compressed because of the sphere’s curvature. 
This can be seen clearly with Greenland.</p>

<p>This map has the useful property that its area is equal to the surface area of the sphere. Thus, while objects are distorted, their areas are still correct.
The relative scale of Greenland to Africa is therefore accurately represented in this map.</p>

<h2 id="the-mercator-map">The Mercator map</h2>

<p>In 1569, Gerardus Mercator wanted to make a global world map that would be useful for navigation. 
He lived in a time when sailing across vast ocean distances was the norm. (In 1492, Christopher Columbus had discovered America by sailing all the way from Spain.)
The maps shown above are fine for artistic impressions and applications, but not for navigation.
The distortions prevent doing any accurate distance and bearing measurements on the map. 
At a local level, lines (eg. roads) which in reality intersect perpendicularly to each other, would be appear to be slanted with respect to each other.</p>

<p>In particular, Mercator wanted to make a map where rhumb lines would be straight. Rhumb lines are curves of constant bearing relative to meridians. 
To follow a rhumb line, a navigator only needs to maintain the same bearing on their compass for the whole journey.
For example, here is the rhumb line through modern day New York and Cape Town:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/NY_to_CPT.png" alt="Arcs from NY to CPT">
	<figcaption>Made with software from <a href="https://imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals">imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals</a> and Inkscape </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At each point along the rhumb line, the angle $\theta$ with the meridian is 48.56°, which corresponds to a bearing of 311°26’18’’ from Cape Town to New York. 
I’ve also shown the great circle, which is a circle whose centre lies on the centre of the sphere. 
Travelling along the great circle is always shorter. In this case, the distance is 12550 km instead of 12600 km along the rhumb line.
With modern technology, it is easy for ships and aeroplanes to stick to the great circles. But back in Mercator’s day, this was rather difficult. 
So sailors preferred to stick to rhumb lines. They would rather get to their destination by travelling a little longer, then get lost and travel a lot more.</p>

<p>Mercator’s idea was to stretch out a cylindrical projection map in the North-South direction to preserve shapes and angles.
Looking at the Lambert projection<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, it can be seen that a different stretch factor is required for each latitude. At the equator, no stretch is required.
At the 45° parallel only a small amount of upward stretching is required. The objects close to the poles have to be stretched a lot to uncompress them.</p>

<p>This stretch factor can be calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Construction process for the Mercator map. Edited from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection"> Wikipedia</a> images </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First Mercator divided the globe into graticules of equal spacing $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\lambda$. 
Along the meridians, the arc length of each graticule is $R\delta\varphi$.
Along the parallels, the radius of the circle is …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>I’ve heard ham radio is dying since as far back as I can remember. It’s one of those common sayings you always hear. Like, “get off my lawn,” and “kids these days.” But is it true? Is there any evidence to support this? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<h2>Ham radio licensees are increasing</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png" alt="" width="733" height="447" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png 900w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-300x183.png 300w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-768x469.png 768w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-850x519.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></figure>



<p>Data from the ARRL shows that ham radio licensees are increasing. When you look at the chart above, you see two significant markers that are likely driving this growth. </p>



<ul><li>The removal of the code requirement by the FCC.</li><li>The economic collapse of 2008.</li></ul>



<p>The Morse code requirement was always an intimidating part of obtaining your General FCC license. Learning Morse code is like learning a second language. It takes time and effort to learn, and that’s not a bad thing. However, it doesn’t change that it scared many people away from the hobby. When the FCC removed this requirement in 2007, I believe it opened the door for many who spent years on the fence. Then you have the economic downturn of 2008. What does that have to do with ham radio? A lot.</p>



<p>After the economic downturn, the United States watched as survivalism, now commonly calling “prepping,” entered mainstream culture. People were worried as the country was involved in multiple wars and our economy was on the brink of collapse. Citizens stocked up on food storage, water, firearms, and…<em>communications equipment</em>. As our country spiraled into more turmoil ham radio licenses steadily increased to more than 750,000 by the end of 2019. </p>



<h2>Is ham radio a hobby or a public service?</h2>



<p><strong>The debate between ham radio being a public service or just a hobby is a common argument</strong>. The reason we exist is to ultimately have a trained citizenry that can response to natural disasters. This will always be a thread in our hobby, but this thread is merging more and more with digital functions, including the Internet. That’s where some people get grumpy.</p>



<h3>FT8/JS8Call</h3>



<p><a href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FT8/JS8Call</a> has drew the ire from older operators who don’t see it as “real ham radio.” Though the technology could have huge implications for passing traffic when conditions are rough in remote parts of the world.</p>



<h3>Digital Mobile Radio (DMR)</h3>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Mobile Radio</a> has exploded in growth in the past decade. Many amateur radio operators use <a href="http://k0lwc.com/what-is-the-range-of-a-dmr-hotspot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet-connected hotspots</a> to operate from their shack without tying up local repeaters. These Internet-connected repeaters hold value, the biggest is the ability to have two different time slots carrying voice traffic simultaneously on one repeater, whether they have an Internet connection or not. DMR doesn’t need to have an Internet backbone to be a game-changer for emergency communications.</p>



<p>Ham radio will always be a hobby where those engaged are practicing to help if the need ever arises, whether they participate in public service events with local clubs or not. And younger operators are redefining how it’s done with new digital technologies — and that’s a great thing!</p>



<h2>Millennials are not killing ham radio… they’re the future</h2>



<p>Some ham radio operators believe younger hams are “killing” the hobby. These often dismissive and vile opinions are not great for the future of amateur radio. Integrating new technology like VOIP and microcomputers into amateur radio is what it’s all about—using the resources available to communicate and exchange information with others around the world. Who cares how we get it done?</p>



<h3>Getting young kids involved in ham radio</h3>



<p>We must get children interested in the hobby. Today, kids aren’t impressed with the ability to talk around with the world on 100 watts and a wire. They’re just not. How do we get young people interested in the digital age where they can communicate anywhere in the world with a tap of a button? The ARRL hasn’t done a great job in attracting young people — but there are things we can do!</p>



<h3>Capitalize on the next generation of space exploration</h3>



<p>The United States is embarking on the next generation of space exploration. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are making space and engineering cool again, and ham radio could easily ride that wave. Focus on targeting kids interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and educate them on AMSAT and the potential to communicate with the International Space Station (ISS). Using space exploration as a drive for getting a ham license would be a fantastic entry point for space geeks everywhere.</p>



<h3>Use remote HF and SWL stations to spark interest</h3>



<p>For young ham radio operators who already have their license, look no further than <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remote Ham Radio</a> as a shining example of how to get kids interested in upgrading their license. <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They offer a program where kids can win free time</a> using world-class remote DX contest stations. The young hams have to meet the following criteria:</p>



<ul><li>Be 25 years old or younger</li><li>Hold a General class or higher license</li><li>Be a member of the ARRL</li><li>Have an interest or experience in DXing/Contesting</li><li>Tell us why RHR would be a good fit for you</li></ul>



<p>Kudos to Remote Ham Radio for offering this program to young hams!</p>



<h3>POTA/SOTA combines ham radio and outdoor adventure</h3>



<p>Living in Colorado, I grew fond of Summits On The Air (SOTA) rather quickly. I mean, it’s cool. You can exercise while playing ham radio all at the same time. We should be focusing on how we can use these outdoor portable operations to attract young hams who love the outdoors. For the extreme outdoor enthusiasts, it would be wise to focus on the usefulness of being able to communicate from the wilderness where cell phone signals are non-existent.</p>



<p><strong>Ham radio has evolved</strong>, albeit slowly compared to other technology sectors. That evolution is inevitable. We can’t fight it. We shouldn’t fight it. We need to find ways to encourage new exploration of communication methodology. That all starts with younger ham radio operators bringing new ideas and skills to our hobby.</p>



<p>Let’s not fight it. Let’s embrace it.</p>

<p>Two months ago, I self-published a book called <a href="https://zerotosoldbook.com/">Zero to Sold: How to Start, Run, and Sell a Bootstrapped Business</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1277573850297966592">released it on Twitter</a>. Within twenty-four hours, I sold 350 copies. Within another twenty-four hours, the book was #1 on Product Hunt and already a category bestseller on Amazon. After a week, 1000 copies had been sold, with sales still going strong and the book ranking as #1 New Release in the “Startups” and “Small Business” Amazon categories. How did this happen?</p>

<h2>The Void</h2>



<p>It started with a blog post that I never published. In 2018, I was so fully immersed in working on <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/from-founding-to-exit-in-two-years-the-feedbackpanda-story/">FeedbackPanda, a teacher productivity SaaS</a> that I co-founded with my partner <a href="https://twitter.com/SimpsonDaniK">Danielle</a>, that I didn’t have much time or energy to write. Every day was filled with customer conversations and product work, with barely any space to reflect on what we had learned. I used the few moments of clarity to jot down notes in a text document, hoping that I’d find some time to polish them into an article. But it never got anywhere near being ready to be published.</p>



<p>And then, we <a href="https://www.sureswiftcapital.com/blog/bootstrapped-saas-founders-sell-business/">chose to sell the business</a>. After a few months of due diligence and transitioning the business over to the new owners, I finally had all the time I ever wanted. My life turned from running a business at full speed into idling my thumbs. When you build an exceptionally sellable company, you focus on making yourself replaceable. Little did I know that once I was replaced, I didn’t have a purpose anymore. So I threw myself right into my next project: documenting what we did and sharing what we had learned. Leading up to building FeedbackPanda, I had consumed a lot of content that successful founders had shared with the community. I wanted to do the exact same thing now: give back to other bootstrapped founders and indie hackers.</p>



<p>Since I hadn’t yet decided on a medium through which I would share my insights, I started collecting content ideas by taking notes whenever I thought of a particular theme. I knew that I would want to release articles on many subjects on a platform, so I planned them out as blog posts from the start. I started working on this list in August of 2019.</p>



<p>Initially, all those ideas revolved around coping with stress and anxiety on some level. That had been the emotional state in which I had found myself in towards the end of running FeedbackPanda. The first series of blog posts I wanted to write was called <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/emotional-journey/">The Emotional Journey of a Bootstrapped Founder</a>.</p>



<p>In a Notion document, I created a table of all my blog post title ideas. Quickly, after I had exhausted all my anxiety-related topics, I pivoted into other areas of running a SaaS business as well. Within a couple days, I had aggregated somewhere between forty and fifty blog post ideas. At that point, I understood for the first time that this might be my next big project.</p>

<p>Whenever I felt like it, I would click on each blog post title idea and jot down a few thoughts on what I’d write about in the article. I would add links to interesting essays, research papers, even photos of little sketches I made on paper.</p>

<p>Several blog posts took shape over the weeks, and I decided to turn this project into reality. I polished those articles following <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro">Julian Shapiro’s recommendations</a>. I ended up with ten or so pieces to start the blog with.</p>



<h2>The Blog</h2>



<p>Here’s an open secret about me: I’m incredibly lazy. If I can avoid tedious work, I’ll spend a lot of time to make sure I never have to do it again. While this really helped us build a well-documented and highly automated business, it is a drawback for a content creator. Writing well and regularly takes a lot of discipline. I knew that I needed some structure in place to hold myself accountable beyond the articles I had already written.</p>



<p>To make sure that this project wouldn’t just evaporate, I decided to commit to building a blog by publishing one article every week, for at least two years. But how could I force myself to write every week? Looking at the content that I regularly consume, I figured that releasing a newsletter every week would keep me accountable for writing something meaningful regularly.</p>



<p>When I built The Bootstrapped Founder blog, I immediately set it up to host the Bootstrapped Founder Newsletter. I released the first episode of that within days of making the blog public. <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1194647611988480000">I announced the launch on Twitter</a>, and got just a few likes. Not surprising.  I had a fledgling audience of maybe 500 followers on Twitter, and I made sure to share my content as much as I could within those first few weeks, including <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/the-bootstrapped-founder/launched-the-bootstrapped-founder-blog--LtZG5nAqrB8ucRj5F-v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the IndieHackers product page</a> I had created for the blog.</p>

<p>My Twitter strategy was simple: just be myself. I love reading the stories of other founders, no matter if they are succeeding or struggling. Amplifying those voices, retweeting their milestones, and commenting when they asked for help was something I consciously did every day. Within weeks, my audience grew, apparently both intrigued by my blog posts, levels of activity, and engagement with the community.</p>



<p>That gave me the fuel to write more and more. There were weeks where I’d work on three to five blog posts at the same time, driven by the discussions I had on Twitter. More and more topics and themes emerged through this work. The list of forty blog post title ideas turned into a list of hundreds of topics, all in different stages of being worked on.</p>



<p>Throughout all of this, people started asking to consume my content on another medium: they wondered if I would ever start a podcast. As a German who learned speaking English mostly from watching Al Bundy on Married with Children and raid-leading large groups of gamers in World of Warcraft back in 2008, I hesitated to put myself out there in an audio-only format. But I quickly understood that this would result in many exciting opportunities: I could diversify my userbase to include those who had no time to read, those who didn’t like reading, it would be another channel to market whatever I would end up selling in the future, and it would allow my readers to put a voice to the thoughts. I would just read the article aloud as the first half of each show. Then, I could add some unscripted content to each episode to make it attractive for those who already read what I had written. Since I wanted the material between the podcast and the blog to be synchronized, I spent a few weeks recording a show or two every day to catch up.</p>



<h2>The Guide</h2>



<p>While I was on this journey through my back catalog, I noticed a fascinating thing. All those blog posts titles I had written when random thoughts had occurred to me seemed to fit into a structure. A larger entity started to take shape. After a few hours of shuffling titles around in a Notion document, I had found that I was well on my way to write a fully-fledged guide on bootstrapping. Without knowing or intending for it to happen, here it was, everything I knew about the journey from idea to acquisition.</p>



<p>I had written maybe 30% of the actual articles I wanted to have in that guide. I decided to go at it for the rest of them the only way I know as a software engineer and bootstrapper: sketch out a foundation and then iterate slowly and deliberately. For the guide (that at that point was called “The Bootstrapped Founder Guide to Bootstrapping,”) that meant that it would start with a compendium. I outlined it by sorting the blog posts I had already written into a structure and putting only headlines in the gaps. Then, over a few days, I filled out those gaps with two to three paragraphs each. I condensed the most important points I would want to make in those yet-to-be-written articles into a few sentences.</p>



<p>And then, I <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1222896794893336578">immediately released the compendium</a> on the 30th of January of 2020, two months after I had started writing on the blog. A few days prior, a Twitter follower had suggested the name “From Zero to Sold,” which I really liked. I shortened it to “Zero to Sold,” and featured the compendium prominently on my website and social media profiles.</p>

<p>From there on, I continued to write an article every week, shared it with my growing newsletter audience, read it on the podcast, and integrated it into the compendium. When I had written around half of the number of articles I wanted to write, someone on Twitter asked me if they could get the compendium as a PDF. They said they’d even pay $10 for it. That really made me think. And when I think, I tweet. Lots of people replied that they’d love to see the compendium fleshed out as a full book.</p>



<p>Suppose you’ve looked into Zero to Sold or have checked out the compendium. In that case, you will know that I recommend an Audience-Problem-Solution-Product approach. Start with a group of people you want to help, find their critical problems, envision a solution that fits their workflow, and build a product in the medium they wish to use. And here was a group of founders and indie hackers (an audience I love), telling me that they need guidance on building their business (a critical problem commonly shared), asking for a full-journey guide (a clear solution to the problem), as a book (as a medium of product consumption). This could not be more validated if I wanted to.</p>



<p>So I sat down to write the rest of the book.</p>



<h2>The Manuscript</h2>



<p>Let me share a few details on how that exactly happened. The first few blog posts were written in Notion, which really didn’t lend itself to long-form writing. I quickly migrated those texts over into individual markdown files, which I …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>All networking applications essentially boil down to stringing together
multiple asynchronous calls in the <em>right</em> way.
Traditionally for programs written in C this would be done through
registering callbacks where the callee either handles the event itself
or dispatches through a state machine.
In such implementations however reasoning about memory safety
can be treacherous, with it sometimes requiring full-program knowledge.
Futures, or promises, as they are also referred to,
ease in that regard by allowing asynchronous programs
to be written in direct style, keeping the control flow linear.</p>

<p>All things considered, I do think that futures can be a good fit
for C programming under the right circumstances.
I also hope this article can serve to help one understand Rust futures,
by being a separate reference that only touches the fundamentals.</p>

<p>The Rust futures story is especially interesting because it is
fundamentally different from the usual workings of futures
in functional languages or, say, JavaScript.
Whereas other implementations are <em>push</em>-based -
meaning you give a function to be pushed to with
the resolved result of the future -
Rust futures are <em>poll</em>-based.
Let us see how this looks in C with the simplification
that we limit ourselves to a single task,
i.e. one top-level future running on one thread.
This is common in embedded programming, and still <em>fairly</em> manageable
without the security guarantees given by Rust.
<a href="https://libuv.org/">libuv</a> is used for the event loop.
No heap allocations will be required - it is all downhill from here
(Get it? Because the stack grows down.) -
other than those imposed by the libuv interface.</p>

<p>The main <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>std::future::Future</code></a> trait
translated into C as a virtual method table becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>{</span> <span>POLL_PENDING</span><span>,</span> <span>POLL_READY</span> <span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>poll</span><span>)(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>);</span>

	<span>// For now let's skip this method</span>
	<span>// void (*drop)(struct Future *self, struct Context *ctx);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As an example, let us consider the simplest case:
A future that immediately resolves with the number <code>4</code>,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>self</span><span>;</span>
	<span>self</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>future</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>simpleFuture</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>future</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>poll</span> <span>=</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>,</span> <span>}</span> <span>};</span>

<span>// ... and in the event loop</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>simpleFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; POLL_READY</span>
<span>// Here we can now use the result</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>result</span> <span>// =&gt; 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To <em>attempt</em> to resolve the future, we poll it;
it returns <code>POLL_READY</code> and as such we are done.
And for futures that instead return <code>POLL_PENDING</code> when polled,
we just make sure to poll them again later -
futures are lazy and do not make progress unless actively told to do so.
No one knows better than the future itself when it should
be polled again - <em>awoken</em> -
so the context given to all futures allows them to awake their own task.
With many parallel tasks the additional complexity would make itself apparent here,
but in our case something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>;</span>
	<span>uv_loop_t</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>wakeTask</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span> <span>// Finished!</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>will suffice.
Polling the future once at startup will then kick off the machinery.</p>

<p>For a libuv timer future, we would want to write something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>TimerStatus</span> <span>{</span> <span>TIMER_NOT_STARTED</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_WAITING</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_FINISHED</span> <span>};</span>

<p>The timer handle is made to hold a reference to the future in
its user data field,
so that the callback knows which future to toggle the status on.
However this requires the future object to be pinned in memory,
moving it would make the reference dangling.
Rust deals with this unsafety using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html">Pin construct</a>,
that wraps a pointer type, <code>P</code>,
and only permits operations that cannot move the pointee
(for cases where it may not always be safe to do so, i.e. <code>P: !Unpin</code>)
and ensures its memory remains valid until it gets dropped,
or helps make manually vetted code <em>nonleaky</em>.
In C there is no such thing;
the closest you will get is with a red paragraph buried in the documentation.
This means treading with care,
allocating storage for the main future once and never copying it, and
only referring to futures with pointers to their static place in memory.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to get by with just one global <code>uv_timer_t</code>
by recognizing that whenever the main future is awoken either:
(I) A timer, necessarily the one with smallest timeout, fired;
or (II) All timers need be dropped and reset, since the futures form a tree,
as we will see.</p>

<h2 id="after-you">After you</h2>

<p>Running multiple futures sequentially is just a matter of
constructing a new future that polls each future to completion,
one after the other.
The poll method of the outer future will have to return <code>POLL_PENDING</code>
after each intermediate step,
before continuing where it left off - like a coroutine.
Rust turns each future into a state machine,
and doing the same in C means playing the part of the Rust compiler.
An adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff’s device</a>,
as <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">described by Simon Tatham</a>,
can help cut down on the boilerplate.
The idea is that with a <code>switch</code> statement enveloping the whole function-body,
you can yield by creating a unique label using the <code>__LINE__</code> macro
where execution will begin upon reentry,
setting the switch-expression as such, and returning.
The following macros do just that</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>Coroutine</span><span>;</span>

<span>#define COR_START(s) switch (*(s)) { case 0:;
#define COR_YIELD(s, r) do {*(s) = __LINE__; return (r); case __LINE__:;} while(0)
#define COR_END }
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>where <code>s</code> is a pointer to the coroutine state.
Great care has to be taken because when returning all locals are invalidated -
if only there was a language that could statically check for such mistakes.
Awaiting then becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#define AWAIT(s, ctx, fut) while ((fut)-&gt;poll((fut), (ctx)) == POLL_PENDING) \
	COR_YIELD((s), POLL_PENDING)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>that is, yielding until the given future is resolved.</p>

<p>To illustrate, here is a future that prints four times to standard output,
first thrice at one second intervals, and then again after two more seconds:</p>

<p>Note that the local <code>i</code> had to be spilled to the future struct
in order to persist across yield points,
and that unions are used to show what variables are active at each step,
and squeeze out that last driblet of performance even in the face of
uncompromising undefined behaviour threats from all directions.</p>

<h2 id="off-to-the-races">Off to the races</h2>

<p>In a similar vein, multiple futures can be made to run in parallel
using a future combinator whose poll method polls all of its children
and either waits for all to complete - <em>joins</em> them,
or selects the first to become ready.
The latter is a tad more difficult, so let us focus on that.
The reason is that after the first future has resolved,
the rest may still be running, their memory possibly referenced elsewhere.
This is where the <code>drop()</code> method that we have skimmed over comes in.
Dropping a pinned object should relax the constraint
that its memory remains valid.
The drop implementation of <code>TimerFuture</code> above could for example
call <code>uv_timer_stop()</code> so the callback never fires
or overwrite the dangling reference to the future with <code>NULL</code>.
For other types, since their drop implementations are …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p>You can find a lot of articles about how to prevent deadlocks in Go, but most of them focus on concurrency patterns and synchronization tools like mutexes. While it is important to know some techniques to prevent them, a trap you can stumble across more easily without noticing, are database transaction deadlocks.</p><p>A transaction deadlock can occur when you start one or more transactions and run queries outside of transactions while they are still active. If you run too many transactions and queries at the same time, you might run out of database connections in the connection pool. Here is a simple example of that:</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">// We will ignore errors for this example,
// you should always check them of course.

tx, _ := db.Begin()
tx.Exec(`INSERT INTO "foo" ("a", "b") VALUES (4, 2)`)

// ...

db.Query(`SELECT * FROM "foo" WHERE "a" = $1 AND "b" = $2`, 4, 2)

// DEADLOCK

tx.Commit()</code></pre><p>In this example, we create a new transaction and insert something to the database. Later on, we try to query the same result from the database. That the inserted row has not been committed yet, is not the actual issue, as you would receive no result in that case. The real issue here is that if you run this code concurrently, you might run out of connections. How many connections are opened to the database can be configured. As soon as your code reaches the <code>db.Query</code> the last connection might be occupied by the transaction and therefore blocks until a connection is available, which might never happen.</p><p>So how do you fix this? First of all, all queries should be run either outside or inside a transaction for a specific part of your code. Even if you run a transaction block and a non-transaction block concurrently, the non-transaction block will not be blocked by the transaction forever (but the non-transaction block might need to wait for the other part to finish). Additionally, you can use a linter or another tool to make sure all queries are run completely inside or outside of transactions.</p><p>I usually write integration tests against the database. If you do the same, you can configure the connection pool size to make sure the tests will only use a single connection. That way the tests will run into a deadlock should you have forgotten to use a transaction somewhere. You can easily configure that inside the <code>TestMain</code> function for a package.</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	db.SetMaxOpenConns(1) // db is the *sql.DB created somewhere
}</code></pre><p>I hope this helps you to prevent some nasty deadlock bugs. I found quite a few in a larger code base by limiting the connection pool. In production, you should use multiple connections to speed up things of course.</p>

<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong>git</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/(http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p>
<p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p>
<pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre>
<pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre>
<p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p>
<p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong>Github</strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/18/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g.&nbsp;Github issues for discussion and task management.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g.&nbsp;only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>

The idea is a simple one- many Makers asked me over the last year about printing smaller parts for the <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">Raspberry Pi Recovery Kit</a>, and I started playing around with options.  I knew I didn’t want to just re-hash the old deck, and I knew I really wanted a better display for this year.  Let’s jump in with what’s different:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>No Pelican case required!  It’s pretty obvious from the photos that you don’t need to spend $50 or more on a case, especially if you are going to drill holes in it, or don’t actually need a waterproof case.</p></li><li><p>Smaller Bill of Materials (BOM).  The original Raspberry Pi Recovery kit was very expensive to build, primarily because I sourced the coolest looking parts I could, which can be expensive or just hard to get (like the keyboard).  This project has a much simpler BOM, so simple that here it is:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>1 kg spool of Paramount 3D’s Olive Green PETG - <a href="https://amzn.to/31lMcqy">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>(Optional) 1K spool of Carbon Fiber PETG and hardened steel nozzle - <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/carbon-fiber-pro-series-petg-filament-1.75mm/sk/MHQ646TD">Link</a> and <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/e3d-v6-extra-nozzle-hardened-steel-1.75mm-x-0.40mm/sk/MSDV7HN9">Link</a></p></li><li><p>Low profile, stainless steel M5 screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/92855A513/">McMaster Carr Link</a></p></li><li><p>M5 threaded rod - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93325A413/">McMaster Carr</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Evq9Vu">bolt cutters</a> are optional, but use safety gear)</p></li><li><p>Four threaded inserts - <a href="https://amzn.to/2FWzNBj">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Pimoroni HDMI Display - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4337">Adafruit Link</a></p></li><li><p>Short HDMI Cable - <a href="https://amzn.to/31tQP21">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Four brass M2.5 standoffs - <a href="https://amzn.to/2CUUKeF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Raspberry Pi 4 - <a href="https://amzn.to/2YwHFzF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Core Design - <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b4bWC7f62Ab-sizzling-fyyran/">Tinkercad Print Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eTexyDTsTKR-stunning-kieran/">Tinkercad Assembled Version</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579460">Thingiverse</a></p></li><li><p>Thumb Screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93886A240/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li><li><p>Cord Grip - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/8302K161/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Something easier to modify/hack over time.  The <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">RPRK</a> was designed to be a “finished” product and execution on an idea, and with people making their own, I thought it would be more fun this time around if people could swap out parts for their own, even ones to radically change the look of the deck.</p></li><li><p>I abandoned panel mount ports on this project.  Panel mounts are often for looks only, at least on many of my older builds, and to keep costs down I just ditched them.  Big, rounded rectangle holes work for me, and don’t cost $15 each time I want to change something.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I wanted a design I could continue to refine and modify for my own projects.  Hopefully I’ll have more of those to share soon!</p></li></ul><p>With that out of the way, let’s go over the basic design.  This can be used as assembly instructions in a pinch too.  Here’s the front frame, which the Pimoroni display will connect to.  That’s really done last, so we won’t see this part again for a while.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597467959462_38425"><p>With that out of the way let’s focus on the main frame, which helps hold it all together.  Here are some of the parts.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_18333"><div><p>The design is simple for the front- there are four threaded inserts for holding the display on the front.  Make sure they go on the front of the front frame.  There are two halves of the front frame, which is held together by the “joiner” part, which has spare M5 holes in case you want to mount something here.  I was still on a carbon fiber kick (read: I still had the hardened steel nozzle installed) so that part was printed with that stuff.  It’s great, but not required if you don’t want to deal with a second and somewhat picky filament.</p><p>Next it’s all about printing all of the rear parts, including what I call the ends and the top/bottom.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_22206"><p>The top and bottom parts are not interchangeable between top and bottom, they go on one orientation only.  This will likely take a while to print!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_26233"><div><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p><p>As you start to assemble be careful of the resistance of some of the deeper holes that screws and threaded rods are going into.  If you feel too much resistance you may need to drill or tap some of the holes- this depends a ton on your printer.  This is especially true of the M5 threaded rod in the next section, which can get bound in the many parts and get very difficult to move.  If you think that’s happening, back out the M5 rod and use a power drill to drill the part holes.  You really only need threading on the parts on each end of the enclosure, and even if you drill it all out, end caps/nuts will do fine to hold the whole thing together.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_27776"><div>

Not all the uppers and lowers will need to be bolted in, but each of the uppers and lowers has the screw hole just in case.  This just makes it easier to keep parts organized.  With all of them bolted it should look like this:</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_33687"><div>

This lets me change cables as I want, with a single cord grip being a bit more economical than a bunch of USB ports that have to get changed over time.  After all, this one will live on a desk.

It scrapes a bit, but it fits!  You can see the Pi4 in there too.  There should be room for a ton of different boards, but beware- the Odyssey x86 board does not fit in this case when you add all the cables, and doesn’t appear to be compatible with the Pimoroni display.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_47664"><div><p>Finally, what I suspect you’re all looking for- the final photos and my reasoning and motivation for this design.

This design took about 7 months to design, including a 3 month break due to life and COVID impacts.  I am lucky so far to be able to continue to work on these projects, and it’s been a great relief to “finish” it.  Like all of my previous projects here, all of the design files and parts lists are in this article so people can make/modify as they see fit.  I would remind fellow makers that it’s licensed under a non-commercial license, so while you can print/modify, doing so commercially is not supported under this project.  Want to do that?  Just reach out to me and we can figure something out.</p><p>Going forward though, many of my originals like this one will be for sale in my shop.  They will be more expensive than making it yourself, so if you’re willing to try- make one!  Commissions are limited and not guaranteed, so the items from my project builds may not last.  Check out <a href="https://back7.co/store">https://back7.co/store</a> to see what’s in stock.</p><p>With that out of the way, here are some quick FAQs on my projects related to this one, the Mil-Plastic case:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Aren’t these just Raspberry Pi laptops?</strong>  Actually, they’re a bit more than that.  This is part sculpture, part functional electronics, and part exercise in design and DIY.  If you want a laptop, then that’s probably the option for you.  These are meant to be hacked/modded/upgraded and redesigned.  I don’t know of a laptop that comes even close to that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do you realize this isn’t waterproof?</strong>  Yes, this is closer to a desk toy than a field computer. </p></li><li><p><strong>How do you get your prints to look like that?</strong>  One simple answer- slow prints (no faster than 45mm/sec), a clean build plate, and no supports.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are you open to commissions or building these for sale?</strong>  I am doing very limited commissions, and they are more expensive than building it yourself.  <a href="https://back7.co/store/original-raspberry-pi-mil-plastic-assembled-kit">This original version is available in the Back7 store here</a>, but after that any additional builds will …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>
