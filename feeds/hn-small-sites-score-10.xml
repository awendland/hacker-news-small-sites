September 9, 2020 | https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>These are the five most annoying inaccessible web elements I face as a blind screen reader user every day, and how to fix them.
</span>
					</p><div>
						<p><span>For blind and visually impaired people like me, accessibility is the difference between us being able to use a website and clicking off it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>How screen readers work</h2>
<p><span>Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired people to use computers, phones and tablets independently. Most screen readers use software, and a Text To Speech (TTS) engine, which is what converts the text from the screen reader into speech. Screen readers convert the text displayed on screen into a format that blind users can process.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read out loud everything that’s on the screen and allow people to navigate using touch gestures and shortcut keys. They also work with other output devices such as a braille display.</span></p>
<p><span>As a screen reader user, here are the most common issues I encounter on a daily basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Unlabelled links and buttons</h2>
<p><span>Screen reader users rely on links and buttons to navigate around a website and to find the information we need. If links and buttons are not labelled correctly or if at all, then it makes it difficult for screen reader users to find the information they need. Ultimately, unlabelled links make it much harder to navigate the website easily, quickly and independently.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when linking to an about page, ‘click here’ doesn’t give any clue as to where it leads to, but ‘find out more about who we are’ is clear.</span></p>
<p><span>If links and buttons are labelled correctly, screen readers can read the label out loud. It means that blind and visually impaired people don’t have to press the link or button without knowing where it will take them.</span></p>
<p><span>As well as unlabelled elements, links and buttons that do not have a clear description are also really frustrating. They must have a clear description of where they will lead to when pressed, rather than ‘click here’. Never make your users guess where a link will take them or force them into a trial-and-error situation. This makes for tedious user experience.</span></p>
<h2>No image descriptions</h2>
<p><span>This is probably the most common issue I encounter when browsing the web.&nbsp;</span><span>Using image descriptions is essential for accessibility. Image descriptions are also known as alt text (alternative text) which is a written description of an image.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read image descriptions out loud. This means that blind and visually impaired people can understand the content of the image in an accessible way.&nbsp;</span><span>If images do not have alt text, then screen readers will simply say “image” or “graphic” which gives no context or meaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Images often convey valuable information. It’s therefore important that people with a visual impairment can access this information as well.&nbsp;</span><span>Alt text should be clearly written and give an accurate description of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://bighack.org/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility/">our tips for writing better alt text</a> to ensure your images are fully accessible.</strong></p>
<h2>Poor use of headings</h2>
<p><span>For quick and easy navigation, many screen reader users navigate using various elements on the page such as headings. They are a great way to find the information we need quickly and effectively. Especially when they follow a logical heading structure with H1s, H2s and H3s helping to prioritise the content.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" alt="Logical heading structure begins with Heading 1, with Heading 2 sitting beneath heading 1. Heading 3 sits within heading 2 and so on." width="1958" height="1236" srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1958px) 100vw, 1958px" data-srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>If websites don’t use headings, it means screen reader users are unable to use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the webpage this way. If that’s the case, we have to resort to tabbing or arrowing through a long web page to find the information we need.</span></p>
<p>Headings also help to break up the web content visually and improve readability. Other elements that screen reader users use to navigate webpages include links, lists or landmarks.</p>
<h2>Inaccessible web forms</h2>
<p><span>Most websites use forms in one way or another. Whether it’s to help you search for a product or to get in touch through a contact form. However, when these forms are not labelled, or not labelled correctly, it means we cannot use them.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a search box is not labelled, it means screen reader users have no idea of the purpose of that box. It means people who use screen readers cannot access the same functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact forms are an effective way for customers to get in touch with your brand or business. And as a screen reader user, there’s nothing more frustrating than these forms being labelled incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially CAPTCHA checkout requirements. Without an option to hear the audio, it’s not accessible. It means we are unable to fill in the form independently. I often have to enlist help from a sighted person, but this isn’t possible for everyone.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2>Auto-playing audio and video</h2>
<p><span>Most people will know how annoying it is to load a web page with noisy adverts that start playing suddenly. But for screen reader users, it can be even more alarming. When video or audio starts playing automatically, it can drown out the voice of the screen reader. This makes it harder to find the pause or stop buttons.</span></p>
<p><span>(And if these buttons are unlabelled, then it’s practically impossible for me to stop the video quickly which causes extra frustration.) If I’m unable to stop the sound or video, I normally click off.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution? Make sure there’s no auto-playing video or audio when your website loads. If you really want to use video, make sure the audio is muted and the user can pause, stop or hide the media player.</span></p>
<p><span>These issues may seem small to sighted users. But they’re the difference between me being able to use a website independently or not. And they make a huge difference when implemented correctly.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>Silcon Labs EFM8: Fantastic value and ease-of-use from the only 8-bit part with a totally-free cross-platform vendor ecosystem</h4><p>The <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/silicon-labs-efm8/">EFM8</a> was the fastest 8-bit part in my round-up, and admittedly, my favorite 8-bit architecture to develop with overall. What these parts lack in brains they make up for in brawns — 14-bit ADCs, 12-bit DACs, lots of timers, and a 72 MHz core clock speed that gives you timing options not found in any other part in the round-up.</p><p>Plus, this is the only 8-bit part with a totally-free, cross-platform, vendor-provided ecosystem. Let that sink in.</p><p>Keil C51 is a silly compiler, but Silicon Labs does an excellent job hiding it under the hood — even when running its Eclipse-based Simplicity Studio on Linux or macOS.</p><p>Simplicity Configurator is the lightest-weight code generator in our round-up, using only 534 bytes of flash to house the entire DMX-512 receiver project. It was one of the easiest to use, and seemed to strike a good balance between abstraction, performance, and ease of use.</p><p>Debugging speeds are snappy with a J-Link debugger, but at $35, the official Silicon Labs USB Debug Adapter is one of the cheapest first-party debugger in the round-up, and clones of the hardware are even cheaper.</p><p>And call me old-fashioned, but I think the 8051 definitely has a place in 2017 — especially among hobbyists and students, where its bit-addressable memory, easy-to-use peripherals, and fuse-free configuration help get students comfortable with microcontrollers quickly.</p><h4>Microchip megaAVR &amp; tinyAVR 1-Series: Different strokes for different folks — still with the best 8-bit toolchain available</h4><p>The <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/atmel-microchip-megaavr/">megaAVR</a> came in surprisingly flat for me: especially when compared with its lower-cost, new sibling, the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/atmel-microchip-tinyavr-1-series/">tinyAVR 1-Series</a>.</p><p>There’s no comparison when it comes to price: tinyAVR has incredible value — packing in a nice assortment of timers, analog peripherals (including a DAC), and a new 20 MHz internal oscillator — while costing 20-40% less than the megaAVR.</p><p>While the megaAVR has a perplexing debugging experience that requires two completely different interfaces and protocols to work with the part, the new one-wire UPDI interface the tinyAVR sports worked flawlessly in my testing.</p><p>But that’s the crux of the problem for the tinyAVR — by shedding many of its megaAVR roots, Microchip ended up with a wonderful microcontroller that will be challenging to use for a large base of Atmel fans: indie developers and hobbyists who use low-cost, open-source programmers (which don’t support the UPDI interface).</p><p>While the tinyAVR wasn’t the fastest part in the round-up (even among 8-bitters), it was the most efficient – both in terms of active-mode power and clock efficiency. Amazingly, the AVR only uses about twice as many instructions as 16- and 32-bit parts when performing 16-bit math.</p><p>Unfortunately, the AVR system as a whole is not without its issues. The Windows-only Atmel Studio is still buggy (especially with older megaAVR devices and AVR Dragon stuff in my tests), and there isn’t an under-$50 low-cost debugger available (other than hacking apart Xplained Mini dev boards).</p><p>In many ways, there seems to be a tacit demarcation Atmel creates between its hobbyist/indie developers, and the professional shops that use Atmel parts.</p><p>As a professional embedded developer, I most definitely have access to Windows computers, and I have no problem blowing a few billable hours’ worth of pay on a $140 debugger.</p><p>But even as popular as Atmel is among hobbyists, Atmel has largely stayed out of this space directly. Instead, they’ve secured small-volume AVR sales by relying on the open-source community to build their own tools for themselves: turning out a slew of hardware and software used to program the megaAVR devices.</p><p>While I applaud the efforts of these developers, these tools are inferior to Atmel’s. Their programming speeds are terrible, they don’t support the new tinyAVR 1-Series devices, and they have absolutely no debug capability.</p><p>Having said that, both the megaAVR and tinyAVR have the best toolchain available for 8-bit MCU development. The part supports a full, end-to-end Makefile-based GCC toolchain.</p><p>If you love printf() debugging, would never touch a proprietary toolchain, and hate IDEs, megaAVR and old tinyAVR parts are definitely for you. The older ones are still available in DIP packages, and as you probably know, there are a ton of low-cost programmers available across the world. The online community is massive, and as clunky as I find Atmel START to be, I have to applaud its support for Makefile-based project generation.</p><p>Consequently, the megaAVR remains the most open-source 8-bit microcontroller on the market — by a long shot.</p><p>But I’d really like to see Microchip provide a PicKit-priced debugger with UPDI support — and allow off-board debugging the way their PIC Curiosity Boards do.</p><p>I also hope these open-source projects can add UPDI support to their tools, so that hobbyists and indie developers can start integrating the tinyAVR into their projects — it’s a much better part, and if you’re an AVR user with access to Atmel Studio, you really ought to buy an Xplained Mini board and take it for a spin.</p><h4>STM32F0: A low-cost, no-nonsense part with arguably the best Arm development ecosystem tested</h4><p><a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/st-stm32f0/">The STM32F0</a> was the lowest-power Arm microcontroller in the round-up, and also one of the easiest to use. STM32CubeMX doesn’t generate the most compact code on Arm (that honor belongs to Cypress PSoC Creator and Infineon DAVE), but it has a snappy interface, and the generated code is easy enough to manipulate for your own goals.</p><p>I love the nearly-stock Eclipse-based environment that System Workbench for STM32 provides, and the ST-Link and excellent Discovery/Nucleo boards seals the deal for me.</p><p>Most pros have used ST parts in their work, but for all these reasons, any hobbyist looking at moving to Arm should probably pick up a dev board from this ecosystem, too. ST has a huge market footprint, so there’s tons of resources online — aimed at both hobbyists and professionals.</p><h4>SAM D10: Killer performance &amp; peripherals, but with runtime library hiccups</h4><p>The Microchip/Atmel <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/atmel-microchip-sam-d10/">SAM D10</a> (and the broader D11/D20/D21 ecosystem) has good value (considering their analog portfolio includes a DAC, and they have good timing options), and the SAM D10 was the most efficient part tested when running at full speed.</p><p>Professionals will like the easy-to-use, well-documented header files, and hobbyists will appreciate the 1.27mm-pitch SOIC package options and GCC compilers that come with the Arm ecosystem. But before I grab this part for a project, Microchip really needs to fix the extremely slow, bloated peripheral library, and update their code-gen tool to do proper error-checking of clock and peripheral configurations.</p><p>As it is, whenever I use Atmel START on the D10, I want to STOP almost immediately. And there are no current, stand-alone peripheral drivers that Microchip has released for this part, so unless you want to do register programming from scratch, you’ll be relying on third-party, open-source projects — like Alex Taradov’s <a href="https://github.com/ataradov/mcu-starter-projects">code examples</a>.</p><h4>Infineon XMC1100: Interesting peripheral perks make this Cortex-M0 stand out</h4><p>The most interesting Arm chip was, without a doubt, the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/infineon-xmc1100/">Infineon XMC1100</a> — and I think professionals who may be wary of getting out of the ST/NXP/Atmel Arm ecosystem need to take a second look at these XMC1000 (and XMC4000) parts.</p><p>The timer options are amazingly flexible, and you can squeeze fantastic performance out of the USIC module.</p><p>I’m going to go out on a limb and recommend that serious hobbyists who are building motor / lighting control projects look into these parts, too. DAVE makes setting up these complex peripherals painless, and the 38-pin TSSOP chips will be substantially easier to solder than the 0.5mm QFNs and QFPs you usually end up with in these pin counts.</p><p>Like many of the parts reviewed here, the biggest problem for hobbyists and indie developers is the tiny online communities and lack of GitHub repos with open-source projects that use these chips. My advice — be bold, and post in the forums. Infineon employees monitor and usually respond within a day or so.</p><h4>PIC16: Tons of peripherals with a slower, power-efficient core</h4><p>When you compare the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/microchip-pic16-five-digit-enhanced/">PIC16</a> with other 8-bit parts out there, it’s obviously a part built for low-power applications, and not processing power. And while the development ecosystem is workable, there are other parts more friendlier pathways — especially for smaller shops, hobbyists, and students who need extremely low-cost tools (and free software).</p><p>To add fuel to the PIC-vs-AVR debate, my testing found that a 32 MHz PIC16 is roughly equivalent to an AVR part running at 1.4 MHz (in terms of math performance), and 9 MHz (in terms of bit-shuffling performance).</p><p>Having said that, the DMX-512 receiver seems a perfect match for the PIC16, and that’s where it looks best in my testing: the PIC16 was the lowest-power 8-bit part in my testing.</p><p>It’s also full of timers and digital logic-oriented peripherals that make it suitable for funky special-purpose projects that require some crafty use of configurable logic and and the numerically-controlled oscillator — these peripherals help offload the (relatively slow) CPU, at the expense of requiring more developer familiarity with the device and these peripherals.</p><p>The usual Microchip gotchas apply: clunky IDE, expensive compilers, and expensive debuggers.</p><p>The usual Microchip advantages apply: huge online community, seemingly infinite product lifetime guarantees, and DIP, SOIC, QFP, and QFN package availability.</p><h4>PIC24: An expensive MSP430 wannabe that doesn’t hit the mark</h4><p>The <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/microchip-pic24/">PIC24</a> is nearly forgettable. In the biquad test, it’s marginally faster than the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/renesas-rl-78/">Renesas RL-78</a> but uses almost three times as much power. In the DMX-512 test, both the RL-78 and MSP430 beat it, too. It was also one of the least-endowed parts in the round-up (which really just means it’s expensive — higher-end PIC24 parts have no shortage …</p></div></div>

    <h2 id="just-for-fun">Just For Fun</h2>

<p>I finally managed to get a complete piglit run over the weekend, and, for my own amusement, I decided to check the timediffs against a reference run from the IRIS driver. Given that the Intel drivers are of extremely high quality (and are direct interfaces to the underlying hardware that I happen to be using), I tend to use ANV and IRIS as my references whenever I’m trying to debug things.</p>

<p>Both runs used the same base checkout from mesa, so all the core/gallium/nir parts were identical.</p>

<p>The results weren’t what I expected.</p>

<p>My expectation when I clicked into the timediffs page was that zink would be massively slower in a huge number of tests, likely to a staggering degree in some cases.</p>

<p>We were, but then also on occasion we weren’t.</p>

<p>As a final disclaimer before I dive into this, I feel like given the current state of people potentially rushing to conclusions I need to say that <strong>I’m not claiming zink is faster than a native GL driver</strong>, only that <strong>for some cases, our performance is oddly better than I expected</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p><img src="https://zmike.github.io/assets/piglit-misc-bench.png" alt="piglit-misc-bench.png"></p>

<p>The first thing to take note of here is that IRIS is massively better than zink in successful test completion, with a near-perfect 99.4% pass rate compared to zink’s measly 91%, and that’s across 2500 more tests too. This is important also since timediff only compares between passing tests.</p>

<p>With that said, somehow zink’s codepath is significantly faster when it comes to dealing with high numbers of varying outputs, and also, weirdly, a bunch of <code>dmat4</code> tests, even though they’re both using the same softfp64 path since my icelake hardware doesn’t support native 64bit operations.</p>

<p>I was skeptical about some of the numbers here, particularly the <code>ext_transform_feedback</code> <code>max-varying-arrays-of-arrays</code> cases, but manual tests were even weirder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>time MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink bin/ext_transform_feedback-max-varyings -auto -fbo

MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink  -auto -fbo  2.13s user 0.03s system 98% cpu 2.197 total
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>time MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris bin/ext_transform_feedback-max-varyings -auto -fbo

MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris  -auto -fbo  301.64s user 0.52s system 99% cpu 5:02.45 total
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>wat.</p>

<p>I don’t have a good explanation for this since I haven’t dug into it other than to speculate that ANV is just massively better at handling large numbers of varying outputs.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>By contrast, zink gets thrashed pretty decisively in <code>arb_map_buffer_alignment-map-invalidate-range</code>, and we’re about <strong>150x slower</strong>.</p>

<p>Yikes. Looks like that’s going to be a target for some work since potentially an application might hit that codepath.</p>

<h2 id="the-weird">The Weird</h2>
<p><img src="https://zmike.github.io/assets/piglit-fp64-bench.png" alt="piglit-fp64-bench.png"></p>

<p>Somehow, zink is noticeably slower in a bunch of other fp64 tests (and this isn’t the full list, only a little over half). It’s strange to me that zink can perform better in certain fp64 cases but then also worse in others, but I’m assuming this is just the result of different shader optimizations happening between the drivers, shifting them onto slightly less slow parts of the softfp64 codepath in certain cases.</p>

<p>Possibly something to look into.</p>

<p>Probably not in too much depth since softfp64 is some pretty crazy stuff.</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>
<p>Tests (and especially piglit ones) are not indicative of real world performance.</p>

<p>Web scraping is that activity where a party uses automated software to crawl the internet and copy data and other content, usually so that it can compile that together and make its own product offering.  This may be of concern to you because you are a company that does web scraping. Or you may be a web publisher and there are other parties that are scraping your content. Let’s examine some of the legal issues around web scraping.</p>



<h3>Breach of contract</h3>



<p>One of the questions that commonly arises around web scraping is whether the activity is a breach of contract. More specifically, the question is whether the use of automated software violates the terms of service of the website that is being scraped. You often see website terms of service prohibit the use of spider and other automated crawling software to access and use the site. Parties who own websites that are being scraped will often look to see whether the scraping of their site is a breach of contract. </p>



<h3>Copyright infringement</h3>



<p>Another common question arising when analyzing web scraping is lawful whether scraping constitutes copyright infringement. This is a difficult argument to make if all that is being scraped is data, because mere facts usually are not subject to copyright protection. But if there is other content being scraped, such as images or specific compilations of data, the question of copyright infringement becomes a bit easier to answer in that unauthorized copying is an likely an infringement.</p>



<h3>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> is another topic that often comes up in discussions about web scraping. This is a federal law that makes it unlawful for a person to access a protected computer without authorization, or in excess of a specific authorization. So the question becomes whether that access by the automated web scraper violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. There are some important things that have to be proven for a plaintiff to succeed under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and one of those is loss or damage that results from the unauthorized access. It is a very fact intensive inquiry that has to be made,  but the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is one thing that parties should think about in the context of web scraping. </p>



<h3>Trade secrets</h3>



<p>The question of trade secrets is another good one to raise in the context of web scraping. A trade secret is any information that a company has that gives that company a commercial advantage in the marketplace because it is secret. The information also has to be the subject of protective efforts — the company has to try to keep the information secret. For example, if information on a website is put there in a way that is behind certain protective barrier,s and the party doing the scraping circumvents those barriers, it could be that there is a misappropriation of trade secrets, particularly if that information is used for some competitive purpose. </p>



<h3>Let’s talk</h3>



<p>Web scraping legal issues can be complex. Scraping presents certain legal risks to the ones doing it, and the law provides certain powerful remedies when web scraping runs afoul of the rules.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Joe and I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/stopachka/status/1295411936625074178" target="_blank">kicked off a re-read of SICP</a>. I can say that it is <em>the</em> most interesting textbook I have gone through. Imagine, you begin with just 4 or 5 constructs, and you end up building algebraic equation solvers, circuit simulators, and even logic programming languages. Because you start off with such few constructs, the added benefit is that you begin to see the fundamentally simple, shared essence in programming. </p><p>I wanted to give you one example that surprised me in the book. We tend to think that <strong>classes belong in a</strong> <strong>fundamentally different category</strong> <strong>from functions.</strong> </p><p>But are they so different? </p><p>For example, let’s say we have a class like this:</p><pre><code>class Person { 
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.fName = firstName; 
    this.lName = lastName;
  }
  getFullName() { 
    return this.fName + ' ' + this.lName;
  }
  setFirstName(firstName) {
    this.fName = firstName;
  }
}</code></pre><p>Well, if we think about it, this is really just a higher order function. a <code>Person</code> higher order function accepts arguments (constructor), and returns a list of functions that can manipulate those arguments (methods). We could write <code>Person</code> like this: </p><pre><code> function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  let fName = firstName; 
  let lName = lastName;

  function getFullName() { 
    return fName + ' ' + lName;
  }
  
  function setFirstName(firstName) { 
    fName = firstName
  }

  return function(method) { 
    switch (method) { 
      case 'getFullName': 
        return getFullName;
      case 'setFirstName': 
        return setFirstName;  
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>Now, </p><pre><code>const person = new Person("Ben", "Bitdiddle")
person.getFullName()</code></pre><p>becomes</p><pre><code>const person = Person("Ben", "Bitdiddle")
person('getFullName')()</code></pre><p>Here, instead of invoking a method, we are “passing” a message. This is why by the way, many classic OO folks talk about object orientation really being about message passing.  </p><p>Yup, really. Classes are just higher order functions, which accept arguments (constructor) and return a list of functions that can manipulate those arguments (methods). </p><p>When you previously thought two concepts were different, but they turn out to be the same, you’re ripe to discover new ideas: you can find the deeper abstractions between them, apply ideas from across those seemingly different categories, and move between concepts more fluidly. So, not only are epiphanies like this fun, but they’re much more useful than you’d think. </p><p>If you liked this, there are a <em>ton</em> of similar epiphanies in the textbook. To experience it best, I suggest picking a partner and working through the book together.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Alex Reichert, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>When it comes to building apps, no-code is having its moment. Typeform is a shining example of how no-code is well suited for simple use cases, and here at JourneyApps we use it extensively. However, therein lies the problem: No-code’s sweet spot is simple use cases. This limitation of no-code tools has been well analyzed. [<a href="https://journeyapps.com/blog/low-code-road-to-software-enlightenment-part-1/">1</a>][<a href="https://www.alexhudson.com/2020/01/13/the-no-code-delusion/">2</a>]</p>

<p>If you want to build more sophisticated custom software, you essentially have two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use a no-code/low-code tool and jump through nasty hoops to implement the sophisticated parts of your app — which most often means writing actual code that needs to conform to the constraints of the tool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use pro-code tools such as Swift/Objective-C, or frameworks like Xamarin/MAUI, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://journeyapps.com/assets/images/blog/2020-09-08-no-code-vs-pro-code-a-new-hope/1.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><em>Image: building anything beyond basic logic with a visual programming language ends up looking like this</em></p>

<h3 id="a-big-problem-that-needs-solving">A Big Problem That Needs Solving</h3>

<p>Both of the above approaches (using pro-code, or using a low-code platform’s pro-code extensibility) are time-consuming, although for different reasons. Both also require senior developer talent, while senior developers are as scarce as hen’s teeth.</p>

<p>The result is that many companies are highly constrained while executing on ambitious software and digital initiatives.</p>

<p>These are the companies that we serve. Enterprise developers have been building custom apps using code on JourneyApps since 2009.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 2019 we wanted to up the ante. We wanted to offer a new app development paradigm for companies with a large app backlog, especially where a big chunk of that backlog consisted of ambitious B2E and B2B apps.</p>

<p>We set two high level goals for ourselves: help companies write great software much more productively (especially those whose core focus is not software), and let them do this using modern software technologies and best practices, without the typical barriers.</p>

<h3 id="key-tenets-of-what-we-set-out-to-build">Key Tenets of What We Set Out to Build</h3>

<p>We decided that the best thing we could do was to build a next-generation IDE (as a complement to our full-stack app platform) that has the <strong>power and flexibility of pro-code</strong> at its core, but also has the high <strong>development velocity and easy adoption of no-code/low-code platforms</strong>.</p>

<p>From the start, we decided that some things are non-negotiable:</p>

<h4 id="1-coding-should-be-easy">1. Coding should be easy</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a new app shouldn’t require any configuration or setup.</li>
  <li>Developers should be able to start coding immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-coding-should-have-a-fast-feedback-loop">2. Coding should have a fast feedback loop</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will have a first-class IDE with real-time error checking, keyboard shortcuts, IntelliSense, etc.</li>
  <li>Developers should have access to a real debugger.</li>
  <li>We will have live, stateful hot reload on an actual device in development mode — not a time-consuming compile &amp; deploy process.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-coding-in-the-ide-should-be-fun-and-relevant">3. Coding in the IDE should be fun and relevant</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will not use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a>: We will support open-source programming languages – preferably those with gradual typing.</li>
  <li>We will not use convoluted proprietary visual interfaces.</li>
  <li>We will not use a proprietary “app store”. Developers must be able to import open source packages.</li>
  <li>The IDE should be easily accessible to junior developers.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-coding-should-be-as-efficient-as-possible">4. Coding should be as efficient as possible</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will provide developers with powerful functionality that can be used with minimal lines of code, and customized as required. This will include things like bi-directional relational offline data sync, dozens of UI components including Excel-like data grids, full audit trails, a cross-platform BLE engine, to name just a few.</li>
  <li>We will offer full git support with either hosted git, or external git providers (e.g. GitHub)</li>
  <li>We will support unit testing.</li>
  <li>We will support multiple environments, with easy portability of changes as new versions of software are moved from one environment to the next.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-there-should-always-be-an-escape-hatch">5. There should always be an escape hatch</h4>

<ul>
  <li>There will be APIs for everything.</li>
  <li>We will allow developers to easily mix in fully custom HTML in their UIs, and allow those custom HTML components to communicate bidirectionally with the rest of the frontend stack, when required.</li>
  <li>There will be a Node.js environment in our cloud backend where developers can build any custom backend functionality, without any configuration or setup.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6-the-platform-should-be-secure-by-design">6. The platform should be secure by design</h4>

<h3 id="a-foundational-decision-building-a-web-ide">A Foundational Decision: Building a Web IDE</h3>

<p>We were taking the time to figure out a new approach to app development from first principles, so we had to make big design decisions with significant trade-offs. One major early decision was whether to build a web-based IDE or an installable desktop IDE.</p>

<p>The obvious question is: “Why an IDE on the web?”. We strongly believe that the recent developments across browser technology, transpiled languages and new approaches to software development (such as declarative UI) have made it possible to not only reach a desktop-grade level of quality in a web IDE, but also capitalize on the inherent benefits of the web paradigm.</p>

<p>Using this approach, we would have an IDE that is evergreen, cross-platform, cross-device, backed by modern UI and most importantly, ready for the future. Oh, and there would be nothing to install. Perhaps the biggest win, however, would be our ability to innovate quickly due to the open nature of web technologies and how quickly they evolve.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss other key design decisions in separate posts.</p>

<h3 id="unveiling-the-solution">Unveiling the Solution</h3>

<p>Today, we’re incredibly proud to announce <a href="https://journeyapps.com/platform/oxide/">OXIDE</a>. It’s the fruit of a lot of hard work by the JourneyApps team over the past year.</p>

<p>OXIDE helps both junior and senior developers build sophisticated cross-platform apps using JavaScript or TypeScript, complemented by visual tools. Apps can run natively on mobile and desktop operating systems, or in the browser as PWAs. Under the hood, OXIDE uses CRDTs [<a href="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/are-crdts-suitable-for-shared-editing/">3</a>] to enable live co-editing in teams, and it is deeply integrated with both GitHub and npm. In OXIDE, developers can switch between visual editing and coding for UI layout and schema design. Developers also have access to a first-class code debugging tool.</p>

<p>OXIDE is a fundamental pillar of the broader JourneyApps platform. Therefore, all apps inherit other flagship JourneyApps technologies out of the box — technologies that have seen around 10 years of R&amp;D and battle-hardening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All apps ship with an enterprise-grade BaaS, and it’s easy to integrate with other data sources (in part because the platform is not based on a DSL).</li>
  <li>All apps are offline-first: Data is automatically synced to user devices, and loaded from the local database on each view. Querying data is fast. This avoids complicated state management and/or query cache systems. (What happens when data volumes scale? The platform provides highly configurable <a href="https://docs.journeyapps.com/reference/container/introduction-to-sync-rules">selective syncing.</a>)</li>
  <li>Each app is automatically provisioned with a Node.js serverless compute environment so that developers of all skill levels can add server-side logic and functionality.</li>
  <li>Developers have access to a rich built-in UI component set that is designed to work with data, with very little development overhead. No tweaking of styles or adding event listeners and state management to each component — this is handled for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, JourneyApps takes the complexity out of the development cycle. We take care of the hard problems of enterprise software development (hosting, offline data sync, mobile app builds, backend APIs, deployment tooling, audit trails, and more) so that developers can focus on core app requirements and maximize the rate of innovation at their companies.</p>

<p>Working in OXIDE looks like this:</p>

<p>Since the IETF’s CFRG decided to recommend OPAQUE as a next-generation <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/21/authenticated-key-exchanges/">Password Authenticated Key Exchange</a>, there has been a lot of buzz in the cryptography community about committing authenticated encryption (known to the more academically inclined as Random Key Robustness), because OPAQUE requires <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/2W9LoeeiRzAiTWVnDsyxvjYPPmo/">an RKR-secure AE scheme</a>.</p>



<p>Random Key Robustness is a property that some symmetric encryption modes have, where it’s not feasible to decrypt a valid (ciphertext, tag) pair into two different plaintexts if both recipients are using different keys.</p>



<p>To illustrate this visually:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1348" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/robustness/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png" data-orig-size="750,550" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="robustness" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png" alt="An example of random key robustness: encrypting two different images, with two different keys, can produce an identical stream of bits (ciphertext + tag)."><figcaption>RKR-secure ciphers don’t let people produce the same ciphertext+tag from two different plaintexts, with two different keys. You might be able to create an identical ciphertext, but the authentication tag will differ. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK">Swizz</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the wake of the CFRG discussion, it became immediately clear that <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM doesn’t meet this requirement</a>.</p>



<p>What wasn’t immediately clear is <a href="https://keymaterial.net/2020/09/07/invisible-salamanders-in-aes-gcm-siv/">that AES-GCM-SIV also falls short</a>. But don’t take my word for it, Sophie Schmieg worked out the math in the linked post, which I highly recommend reading.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that AES-GCM or AES-GCM-SIV are doomed, or should be deprecated. You probably don’t even care about Random Key Robustness in most of the places you’d use either algorithm! But if you are doing something where RKR actually matters, you probably care a lot. And it certainly violates the principle of least astonishment.</p>



<p>ChaCha20-Poly1305 won’t save you here either, since this is a property that message authentication codes based on cryptographic hash functions (e.g. HMAC) provide, but polynomial MACs (GMAC, Poly1305, etc.) do not.</p>



<p>So, if every standardized and widely-supported AEAD construction fails to provide RKR security, what’s a software engineer to do?<em> <a href="https://vnhacker.blogspot.com/2020/08/so-you-want-to-roll-your-own-crypto.html">Roll their own crypto</a>?!</em></p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="61" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/glitch-ecb/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png" data-orig-size="224,224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="glitch-ecb" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png" alt=""><figcaption>Don’t actually do that. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK">Swizz</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you’re always on a well-tread path with a well-defined, standard threat model (i.e. client-server application accessible via TLS 1.3, possibly storing hashed passwords server-side), then rolling your own crypto isn’t just dangerous; it’s wholly unnecessary.</p>



<h2 id="coping-with-nonstandard-threat-models">Coping with Non-Standard Threat Models</h2>



<p>Systems that require Random Key Robustness do not fall within the standard threat model of AEAD cipher constructions.</p>



<p>However, RKR is far from the only scenario in which application developers might find themselves without a clear solution. Another example that comes up a lot:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I need to encrypt data in a relational database, but still somehow use it in SELECT queries.”</p><cite>— Far too many damn developers who haven’t heard of <a href="https://ciphersweet.paragonie.com/">CipherSweet</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The first thing that you should do is clearly document your requirements and what attacks your system must protect against. Any undefined attack vector in your model should be assumed to be a vulnerability in your design. (This gets into <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">Unknown Unknowns</a> territory quickly.)</p>



<p>And then you should have a cryptographer review your design, and then have a cryptography engineer build it for you.</p>



<p><strong><em>But where’s the fun in that?</em></strong></p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Instead of copping out with sane and reasonable advice, let’s actually walk through the process. At the end of this post, I’ll share a toy example I cooked up for this blog post.</p>



<h2 id="designing-new-cryptography">Designing New Cryptography</h2>



<h3 id="understand-the-problem">First, Understand the Problem</h3>



<p>Why don’t AES-GCM, etc. provide Random Key Robustness? Because they’re built with universal hash functions rather than cryptographic hash functions.</p>



<p>Cryptographic hash functions have different properties (i.e. preimage resistance and collision resistance) that make it significantly difficult to calculate two different authentication tags under two different keys. Attacking HMAC-SHA-256 in this way is about <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">as expensive as brute forcing a 128-bit AES key</a>. (Good luck with that!)</p>



<p>However, cryptographic hash functions are much slower than polynomial MACs, and using them in a construction like HMAC approximately doubles the slowness.</p>



<p>You might be tempted to just hash they key and the message together to save on CPU cycles, but that’s actually <a href="https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2012/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hash-length-extension-attacks">not safe for the hash functions nearly everybody uses</a> (due to length extension attacks).</p>



<p>It logically follows that, <strong>if we had an AEAD cipher construction based on a hash function, we could have RKR security</strong>.</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="prior-art">Look At Prior Art</h3>



<p>Before the days of AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, there were a lot of ad hoc constructions used everywhere based on <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-aes-cbc">AES-CBC and HMAC</a>. (In that era, everyone used HMAC-SHA1, but don’t do that.)</p>



<p>However, there are a number of problems with ad hoc CBC+HMAC that we don’t want to reintroduce in modern systems:</p>



<ol><li>If you forget to include the initialization vector in the HMAC tag, you give attackers free reign over the first 16 bytes of the decrypted plaintext without having to break the MAC.</li><li>The order of operations (Encrypt-then-MAC, MAC-then-Encrypt, Encrypt and MAC) matters tremendously.</li><li>CBC+HMAC is usually implemented in application-layer code, but the security of such a construction depends heavily on the availability and utilization of <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/#string-comparison">constant-time functions</a>.</li><li>There is no standard format for CBC+HMAC, nor the order of operations for what gets fed into the MAC.<ul><li>IV + ciphertext? Ciphertext + IV?</li></ul><ul><li>Append the MAC, or prepend it?</li></ul></li><li>CBC+HMAC is only an AE mode, there is no room for additional authenticated data. If you try to naively shove extra data into the HMAC, <em>now you have to worry about canonicalization attacks</em>!</li><li>CBC mode requires padding (usually PKCS #7 padding), whereas cipher modes based on CTR do not.</li></ol>



<p>This is among the long list of reasons why cryptographers have spent the past decade (or longer) pushing developers towards AEAD modes.</p>



<p>Boring cryptography is good cryptography!</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Make sure you clearly understand the risks of the components other constructions have used.</p>



<h3 id="sketch-first-draft">Sketch Out A First Draft</h3>



<p>By now, it should be clear that if we have an Encrypt-then-MAC construction, where the MAC is based on a cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA-256), we may be able to attain RKR security.</p>



<p>With that in mind, our sketch will probably look something like this:</p>



<ul><li>Encrypt(K1, M, N) -&gt; C<ul><li>Where Encrypt() is AES-CTR or equivalent</li></ul></li><li>Auth(K2, C, A) -&gt; T<ul><li>Where Auth() wraps HMAC-SHA2 or equivalent</li><li>How we feed C and A into the underlying MAC is important</li></ul></li><li>???? -&gt; K1, K2</li></ul>



<p>We still have to define some way of splitting a key (K) into two distinct keys (K1, K2). You never want to use a cryptographic key for more than one purpose, after all.</p>



<h3>Key-Splitting and Robustness</h3>



<p>Your encryption key and authentication key should be different, but they should also derived from the same input key! This is mainly to protect implementors from having independent keys and accidentally creating a forgery vulnerability.</p>



<p>There are several different ways you can split keys:</p>



<ol><li>Just use SHA-512(k), then cut it in half. Use one half for encryption, the other for authentication.</li><li>Use HMAC-SHA256(k, c1) and HMAC-SHA256(k, c2), where c1 and c2 are distinct (yet arbitrary) constants.</li><li>Use HKDF. This works with any secure cryptographic hash function, and was specifically designed for situations like this. HKDF also supports salting, which can be used to randomize our derived keys.</li></ol>



<p>We can really pick any of these three and be safe, but I’d advise against the first option. HKDF uses HMAC under-the-hood, so either of the latter options is fine.</p>



<h3 id="speed">Can We Make it Faster?</h3>



<p>What if, instead of HMAC-SHA256, we used <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>?</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1362" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/blake3/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blake3.png" data-orig-size="1251,913" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="blake3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blake3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blake3.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blake3.png" alt=""><figcaption>BLAKE3’s performance compared with other hash functions.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>BLAKE3’s advertised 6.8 GiB/s can be even faster than <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/60269">Poly1305 or GHASH</a> (and BLAKE3’s speed really shines through with long messages, due to its extreme parallelism through Merkle trees).</p>



<h3 id="chacha-vs-aes">In Favor of ChaCha over AES</h3>



<p>It’s no secret that <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">I’m not a fan of AES</a>. It’s not the mathematical properties of AES that bother me, it’s the 128-bit block size and the fact that software implementations have to decide between being fast or being secure.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="116" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatok_stickerpack-facepaw/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/soatok_stickerpack-facepaw.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Facepaw!" data-image-description="<p>Facepaw!</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>ChaCha’s 256-bit security level is easier to justify: The underlying PRF state is 512 bits (which implies an approximately 256-bit security level) and the keys are always 256 bits.</p>



<p><s>Furthermore, if you’re building ChaCha and BLAKE3 in the same codebase, you could reuse some components (i.e. the compression function, G). This is very desirable if you’re trying to ship a small amount of code (e.g. embedded systems).</s> EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/veorq">One of the BLAKE3 authors</a> informed me that I’m mistaken about this: “[N]ope, not exactly the same logic (rotations in different direction)”.</p>



<h3 id="other-desirable-properties">Other Desirable Security Properties</h3>



<h4 id="nonces">Nonce Nonsense</h4>



<p>One of the biggest problems with standard AEAD modes is that they explode gloriously when you reuse a nonce. There are two ways out of this peril:</p>



<ol><li>Use a nonce misuse resistant AEAD construction (AES-GCM-SIV, etc.).<ul><li>For prior art on nonce-misuse resistant cipher modes based on ChaCha, check out <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/067">DAENCE</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Use large nonces (e.g. XChaCha20 uses 192-bit nonces) and generate them randomly, so the probability of nonce reuse becomes negligible.</li></ol>



<p>Since we’re already planning on using a hash function to derive subkeys (one for encryption, one for authentication), it makes sense to also accept a longer nonce than our stream cipher demands. The excess bytes can be passed to our KDF without significant risk or additional overhead.</p>



<p>Since the IETF’s ChaCha20 variant expects a 96-bit nonce, designing our construction to support 256-bit nonces means we can pass the first 160 bits of the nonce to the KDF and the latter 96 bits to the stream cipher. You can expect a single KDF collision after 2^80 encryptions, but it will almost certainly occur with a different nonce.</p>

quite probably you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX">ActiveX</a> controls. Most
frequently this involved bulky popups on pages with these controls having to display something
more complex than a few blocks of text.</p>

<p>Or, remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Java applets</a>? They became
available in 1995, and later they weren’t limited to just Windows and Internet Explorer. I remember
I had to use Java applets on macOS as recently as 2013, which chronologically is closer to the
present time than the 90s are. (Feeling so old anyway! 👴)</p>

<p>Seems like ActiveX and Java applets were necessities mostly in the enterprise world, but
Macromedia Flash (later known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a>)
was certainly much more widely known to consumers. It was a requirement in the early days of streaming
video (even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7926001/youtube-drops-flash-for-html5-video-default">YouTube required
Flash</a>
to work back then!), but also a major driver in browser gaming in late 2000s and early 2010s.
We certainly could blame Flash for making our browser windows look like this:</p>

<p>While ActiveX has seemingly failed to reach a significant adoption, Microsoft made yet another
attempt with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Silverlight</a>:</p>
<p>

<p>In the meantime, Google was working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client">its own thing for
Chrome</a>:</p>

<p>It would be fair to say that these attempts failed to establish wide adoption, especially
after both consumers and businesses started shifting to mobile. Here’s how all these forays ended
according to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft dropped ActiveX support from the Windows Store edition of Internet Explorer 10 in
Windows 8. In 2015 Microsoft released Microsoft Edge, the replacement for Internet Explorer with
no support for ActiveX, this marked the end of the technology in Microsoft’s web browser
development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in 2013, major web browsers began to phase out support for the underlying technology
applets used to run, with applets becoming completely unable to be run by 2015–2017. Java applets
were deprecated since Java 9 in 2017 and removed from Java SE 11 (18.9), released in September
2018.</p>

and will cease support, distribution, and security updates for Flash Player.</p>

<h2>But JavaScript solved all these problems, didn’t it?</h2>
<p>Most of these browser add-ons were introduced before modern JavaScript and HTML5 became available,
so one could argue you no longer need browser add-ons at all. Well, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/27/web-without-javascript">some
purists</a> even say browsers
should have never supported JavaScript or any scripting whatsoever in the first place. Nevertheless,
there are enough use cases for browser scripting and browser apps in general that are hard to avoid.
When looking at the history of browser plugins in general, it’s hard not to notice a few themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributing productivity apps via browsers is convenient in a lot of cases.</li>
<li>Browser gaming made a lot of sense, especially for casual games.</li>
<li>In both of these scenarios browsers had to display something more complex than text and a few
static images.</li>
</ul>

    </p>
<p><small>The modern casual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense game genre</a>
arguably was reborn due to the popularity of Adobe Flash and browser gaming, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Element_TD">Flash Element
TD</a> being a classic example.</small></p>
<p>Even though native apps were (and in many situations still are) objectively better for users, early
browser apps were attempting to build their own ad-hoc app stores before the App Store existed.
You didn’t have to buy a CD with an application and install it and manage it on your disk. You
didn’t have to install updates manually and migrate your data. There was no need to uninstall apps,
you just close a corresponding browser tab and forget about it.</p>
<p>And when browser scripting capabilities became advanced enough, some people started seeing the
allure of making a browser version of their app the only version they provided. Browsers are
cross-platform, aren’t they? Just wrap your JavaScript app code in a browser-like container (say
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)">Electron</a>) and distribute that instead
of your native app. </p>
<p>But eventually not only the JavaScript APIs became more complex, the language itself could no longer
accommodate what developers wanted. Not everyone liked JavaScript syntax (remember
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a>?) or semantics (I couldn’t help but
notice that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript</a> has grown in popularity in recent
years). But it’s hard to transpile an arbitrary programming language to JavaScript, the latter was
not built with that goal in mind.</p>
<p>Corollary, the JavaScript interpreter itself has both memory and performance overhead. Having a
garbage collector built in makes it even harder to transpile languages with different memory models
to JavaScript. The allure of having only one language to write all your apps for all platforms is
still there, but why do you have to be confined to JavaScript itself, even as a target language?</p>
<h2>How WebAssembly actually started</h2>
<p>With the death of browser plugins, at least we can praise the interoperability efforts of browser
vendors. Some lowest common denominator of JavaScript is supported in all browsers, and there is a
clear incentive for the vendors to keep up. With the demand to go beyond JavaScript, there were
initial attempts to support low level programming with asm.js in 2013:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of this performance gain over normal JavaScript [with asm.js was] due to 100% type consistency
and virtually no garbage collection (memory is manually managed in a large typed array).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js">“asm.js”</a> article on Wikipedia.</small></p>
<p>Syntactically this still looked pretty much like JavaScript, but when you have a lot of low level code,
the resulting file can get big pretty quickly, and the size of your code is pretty important when your
users download it frequently. As you weren’t supposed to write asm.js code manually most of the time,
and it was designed primarily as compilation target, it made sense to invent a binary format for it.
That’s basically how WebAssembly started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly was first announced in 2015, and the first demonstration was executing Unity’s Angry
Bots in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. The precursor technologies were asm.js from
Mozilla and Google Native Client, and the initial implementation was based on the feature set of
asm.js.</p>

<h2>What WebAssembly got right</h2>
<p>Now you’re no longer restricted to JavaScript as a target language for browser apps. As soon as
<a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> got WebAssembly backend more or less ready, it allowed compilers built
on top of LLVM (for C, C++, Rust, Swift and many more) to adopt it without rewriting everything from
scratch. This unlocked the browser environment to a huge amount of pre-existing software that can
also run close to native speed if optimized well.</p>
<p>Not only can you run fun little projects such as <a href="https://sandspiel.club/">Sandspiel</a> and
<a href="https://orb.farm/">orb.farm</a> in your browser tab, but complex games such as <a href="https://www.continuation-labs.com/projects/d3wasm/">Doom
3</a> (at least its demo version) are available too.
Both <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/08/15/webassembly-is-here/">Unity</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/unrealengine/status/932624595722559490">Unreal
Engine</a> announced their support for
WebAssembly, and while we may not see AAA games running in browsers on their initial release date,
this still gives enough confidence in the maturity of the platform.</p>

<p><small>According to its creator, <a href="https://orb.farm/">orb.farm</a> is “a virtual ecosystem where different
species of creature can live, grow and die as part of a self-contained food chain”.</small></p>
<p>It’s obviously not limited to games, as we can see Apple folks compiling their <a href="https://twitter.com/lrz/status/1250453967957561344">C++ and Objective-C
code from iWork</a> to Wasm<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, or
<a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> using it in their browser extension getting substantial
performance improvements as a result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With our move to WebAssembly, page filling and analysis now runs at least twice as fast as before,
and those websites with a large number of fields are up to 13x faster in Chrome and up to 39x
faster in Firefox! It’s blazing fast. 🔥</p>
</blockquote>

article on <a href="https://blog.1password.com/">the 1Password blog</a>.</small></p>
<h2>Wasm is a general purpose virtual machine</h2>
<p>Not only you get performance improvements with WebAssembly compared to JavaScript, as it was
designed to run arbitrary code in your browser, it’s one of the most widely available secure sandbox
environments. And as a general purpose virtual machine, Wasm is not limited only to browsers.
<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> uses it for edge computing on their CDN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re excited by the possibilities that WebAssembly opens up. Perhaps, by integrating with
Cloudflare Spectrum, we could allow existing C/C++ server code to handle arbitrary TCP and UDP
protocols on the edge, like a sort of massively-distributed inetd. Perhaps game servers could
reduce latency by running on Cloudflare, as close to the player as possible. Maybe, with the help
of some GPUs and OpenGL bindings, you could do 3D rendering and real-time streaming directly from
the edge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/webassembly-on-cloudflare-workers/">“WebAssembly on Cloudflare
Workers”</a> on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/">the Cloudflare
blog</a>.</small></p>
<p>With people realizing the wide applicability of the Wasm tech stack, it was no surprise when
<a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> (stands for WebAssembly System Interface) appeared. Where WebAssembly
itself is a “bare metal” platform, it does not supply any primitives such as memory allocation or
filesystem access, which WASI does provide. As Solomon Hykes, creator of Docker, <a href="https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1111004913222324225">puts
it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn’t have needed to created Docker. That’s how important it
is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system …</p></blockquote></div></div>

The set up is fairly straight forward: model an A/B test as sampling from two beta distributions, sample from each distribution a lot, then compare the results.</p><p>This simulation approach often first appears as a clever little trick to solve a more complex math problem, but in fact is a primative form of Monte-Carlo Integration and turns out to one of the only ways to really solve this problem. By exploring this topic deeper in this post we'll see some of the myths that many people have about analytic solutions as well as demonstrating why Monte-carlo methods are so essential to Bayesian statistics.</p></div><h2>Background: A conversation about election results</h2><div><p>An interesting conversation happened on Twitter recently.

So it is not inconsistent, nor suprising for someone to believe a candidate has 71% chance of success and they still lose. Even when looking at typical p-values, we wait for 95% percent certainty before making claims (and many feel this is a pretty weak belief). But for some reason whenever election polls come up, it seems even very statistically minded people suddenly think that 51% chance is a high probability.</p><p>I retweeted Nate Silver's forecast, mentioned my annoyance and provided an example of another case with a similar probability of winning:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. <br><br>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:<br><br>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials<br><br>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href=\&quot;https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao\&quot;>https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p>\u2014 Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;Will Kurt&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_6372"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. </p><p>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:</p><p>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials</p><p>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href="https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao">https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p></div>— Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href="https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

What we are really doing here is equalivant to using a Monte-Carlo simulation to integrate over the distribution of the difference between two Beta distributed random variables. After the next two sections it will be more clear that what's happening here is a surprisingly sophisticated operation that is, in my opinion, the easiest method of solving this problem as well as not truly a brute force solution.</p></div><h2><br>Analytic versus Easy</h2><div><p>When we see computational solutions to mathematical problems our first instinct is typically to feel that we are avoiding solving the problem <em>analytically.</em> An analytical solution is one that uses mathematical analysis to find a closed form solution.</p><p>A strivial example, suppose I wanted to find the value that minimized \(f(x) = (x+3)^2\)</p><p>In R I could brute force this by looking over a range of answers like this:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_13626"><div><pre><span>f</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>-</span> <span>function</span>(<span>x</span>){

It's also a bit messy because if we had iterated by an incredment that didn't include -3 exactly (say by 0.031) we would not get the exact answer.</p><p>If we know some basic calculus we know that our minimum has to be where the derivative is at 0. We can very easily work out that</p><p>$$f'(x) = 2(x+3)$$<br>And that</p><p>$$2(x + 3) = 0 $$</p><p>When</p><p>$$ x = -3 $$</p><p>Knowning basic calculus this later solution becomes much easier. </p><p>But even with the calculus is part is hard, often solving it once makes future solutions much easier. Take for example if you wanted to find the maximum likelihood for a normal distribution with a mean of \(\mu\) and standard deviation of \(\sigma\)</p><p>To solve this we start with our PDF for the normal distribution \(\varphi\):</p><p>$$\varphi(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$</p><p>Now computing the derivative of this is not necessarily "easy" but it's certainly something we can do. All we really care about is when</p><p>$$\varphi'(x) = 0$$</p><p>Which we can find out happens when (computing the deriviative of course is left as an exercise for the reader):</p><p>$$\frac{\mu-x}{\sigma}$$</p></div><div><p>This allows us to reallize the amazing fact that for any normal distribution we come across, we know that the maximum likelihood estimate is the sample is when \(x = \mu\)!</p><p>Even though our calculus might take us a bit of work, once this is done the problem of doing maximum likelihood estimation for any Normal distribution truly does become easy!</p></div><h3><br>Proposing an Analytic solution to our problem</h3><div><p>Let's revisit our original problem this time attempting to find an analytic solution. This is a very interesting case because arguably this is the simplest Bayesian hypothesis test you can imagine.</p><p>Recall that we have two random variable representing our beliefs in each test. These are distributed according the the posterior which we described earlier.</p><p>$$A \sim \text{Beta}(2+1, 13+1)$$<br>$$B \sim \text{Beta}(3+1,11+1)$$</p><p>Here is where I skipped some steps in reasoning. What we want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B &gt;A)$$</p></div><div><p>Which is not expressed in a particularly useful mathematical way. A better way to solve this is to consider this as the sum (or difference in this case) of two random variables. What we really want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B - A &gt; 0)$$</p><p>In order to solve this problem we can think of a new random variable \(X\) which is going to be the difference between B and A:</p><p>$$X = B - A$$</p><p>Finally we'll suppose we have a probability density function for \(X\) we'll call \(\text{pdf}_X\). If we know \(\text{pdf}_X\) our solution is pretty close, we just need to integrate between 0 and the max domain of this distribution:</p><p>$$P(B &gt; A) = P(B - A &gt; 0) = \int_{x=0}^{\text{max}}\text{pdf}_{X}(x)$$</p><p>Already this is starting to look a bit complicated, but there's one big problem ahead. Unlike Normally distributed random variables, we have no equivalent of the Normal sum theorem (we'll cover this in a bit) for Beta distributed random variables. </p><p>What does \(\text{pdf}_X\) look like? For starters we know it's not a Beta distribution itself. We can see this because we know the domain (or support) of this distribution is not \([0,1]\). Because they are Beta distributed, A and B can both take on values from 0 to 1, which means the maximum result of this difference is 1 but the minimum is -1. So whatever this distribution is, its domain is \([-1,1]\) meaning it cannot be a Beta distribution.</p><p>We can use various rules about sum of random variables to determine the mean and variance of this distribution, but without knowing the exact form of this distribution we are unable to solve the integral analytically. </p><p>Here we can see that even in this profoundly simple problem the analytical solution is frustratingly …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></section></div></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>
<h2>Accompanying Video</h2>
<p>This is an important topic. To ensure that we can cover those who like to read/ skim and those who like to get information via audio, we have an accompanying video:</p>

<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>

<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>

<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

        <p>A story on Hacker News recently argued that webpage speeds haven't improved, even as internet speeds have gone up.</p>
<p>This article explains why that conclusion can't be drawn from the original data.</p>
<p>We'll also look at how devices and the web have changed over the past 10 years, and what those changes have meant for web performance.</p>

<h2 id="interpreting-the-http-archive-data">Interpreting the HTTP Archive data</h2>
<p>This chart from the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/">Nielsen Norman Group article</a> suggested that increasing mobile network bandwidth hasn't resulted in faster page load times.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart.png" alt="Chart showing increasing bandwidth along increasing page load times"></p>
<p>However, <strong>the connection speed used by HTTP Archive has not actually increased over time.</strong></p>
<p>Instead it went down in 2013, <a href="https://httparchive.org/faq#what-changes-have-been-made-to-the-test-environment-that-might-affect-the-data">switching from wifi to an emulated 3G connection</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart-annotated.png" alt="Annotation for page loads time showing when methodology changed"></p>
<p>The onLoad metric has increased 55% since 2013, from 12.7s to 19.7s. If you bought a phone in 2013 and have been on a 3G connection ever since, then the web has become slower for you.</p>
<p>Before looking at how devices and the web have changed over the last 10 years, here are a few notes on how to think about this data.</p>
<h3 id="why-look-at-on-load">Why look at onLoad?</h3>
<p>The <code>load</code> event is emitted by the page when all page resources like scripts or images have been downloaded.</p>
<p>If the top of a page renders quickly, but the page also loads 20 images further down, then the onLoad metric will suggest that the page is slow.</p>
<p>A different page might not initially render anything useful at all, and only start loading additional resources and rendering content long after the onLoad event. Yet this page will appear fast.</p>
<p>As a result, onLoad doesn't do a good job measuring whether a user experiences the page as fast.</p>
<p>So why do we even look at this metric? <strong>Because it's been around for a long time</strong>, and HTTP Archive has been tracking it since 2010. Newer metrics like <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> or Time to Interactive were only added to HTTP Archive in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="should-we-expect-increasing-bandwidth-to-result-in-faster-page-load-times">Should we expect increasing bandwidth to result in faster page load times?</h3>
<p>Increasing bandwidth will only make a page load faster if bandwidth is the bottleneck at some point. It won't help if you're on a Gigabit connection with a 1s network roundtrip time.</p>
<p>However, the 1.6Mbps 3G connection emulated by HTTP Archive is very slow, so we should expect significant performance improvements as bandwidth improves. The average website downloads 1.7MB of data in 2020, which will take at least 9s to download on the HTTP Archive connection.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-http-archive-caveats">Some more HTTP Archive caveats</h3>
<p>I'll talk a lot about "the average website" in this article. It's worth noting that HTTP Archive only collects data on homepages, not pages deeper down in the site. The corpus of tested domains has also grown over time.</p>
<p>The tests weren't always run on the same device. Initially a physical iPhone 4 was used, today the tests are run on an emulated Android device.</p>
<p>We'll look at median metric values in this article. If most websites are fast but one in five websites freeze your phone for 20s we won't be able to pick this up.</p>
<h3 id="performance-on-desktop">Performance on desktop</h3>
<p>This article will focus on mobile performance in the US. However, if you're looking at the desktop data from the original article, it's worth noting that the test bandwidth was increased and latency was reduced in 2013.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/desktop-performance.png" alt="Chart showing desktop connection speeds and when emulated connection speed changed"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-mobile-networks-and-devices-changed-over-the-last-10-years">How have mobile networks and devices changed over the last 10 years?</h2>
<p>Let's look at 4 factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>network bandwidth</li>
<li>network latency</li>
<li>processor speeds</li>
<li>browser performance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-network-bandwidth-in-the-us">Mobile network bandwidth in the US</h3>
<p>This chart shows average mobile bandwidth in the US by year, according to different sources. It increased from 1 Mbps to around 30 Mbps.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-bandwidth.png" alt="Mobile bandwidth in the US by year"></p>
<p>(I've not been very careful when collecting this data. For example, I didn't consistently distinguish when data was collected from when it was published. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifZ_ngADpT3YzezNQLpXKCsr74-BvaBJUkYm6PGpv1g/edit?usp=sharing">You can find my sources here</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="mobile-network-latency-in-the-us">Mobile network latency in the US</h3>
<p>This was harder to find data on, but the results indicate that latency dropped from around 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-latency.png" alt="Mobile latency in the US by year, going down from 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020"></p>
<h3 id="mobile-device-cpu-speeds">Mobile device CPU speeds</h3>
<p>I've not been able to find data on average mobile device speeds in the US. But <a href="https://infrequently.org/">Alex Russel</a> and <a href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> have published a <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1233275220275818498">chart showing GeekBench 4 scores alongside the release years of different phones</a>.</p>
<p>Even budget phones have become 4x faster, with iPhones now being up to 20x more powerful.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/mobile-cpu-benchmark.jpeg" alt="Mobile CPU performance over time"></p>
<h3 id="how-have-browsers-changed">How have browsers changed?</h3>
<p>A lot of work has been done on browsers over the last 10 years. JavaScript has become a larger part of the web, so many improvements have focussed here.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/10-years">this chart from the V8 blog</a>, page CPU usage for gone down by a factor of 4.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/v8-performance.png" alt="V8 Speedometer 1 benchmark results 2013 to 2018"></p>
<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Browser networking has also improved, for example with the introduction of HTTP/2 in 2015. 64% of requests are now served over HTTP/2.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/http2.png" alt="HTTP/2 adoption over time"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-websites-changed">How have websites changed?</h2>
<p>Let's look at some data from HTTP Archive to see how websites have changed.</p>
<h3 id="page-weight">Page weight</h3>
<p><a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight">Mobile page weight</a> increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020. This is primarily driven by an increase in images and JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Other resources also increased a lot –&nbsp;I suspect these are mostly videos.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/page-weight.png" alt="Page weight by resource type over time"></p>
<p>The chart starts in 2013 as HTTP Archive changed its methodology in October 2012. Before page weight was undercounted, as the test stopped when the page load event was triggered, even if more data was still being loaded.</p>
<h3 id="java-script-execution-time">JavaScript execution time</h3>
<p>JavaScript would be the most likely culprit if pages are getting slower despite faster mobile networks. Unfortunately, HTTP Archive only started collecting this data in late 2017, and it seems to have been mostly stable since then.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/javascript-execution-time.png" alt="HTTP Archive JavaScript execution time chart"></p>
<p>The drop in mid-2018 can probably be attributed to a URL corpus change.</p>
<p>Note that the absolute run duration (0.5s) is less than what you'd normally see in a tool like Lighthouse. These tools normally slow down JavaScript execution to emulate a mobile device, but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/methodology#lighthouse">this was broken for the HTTP Archive tests</a>. So while this number might be realistic for mid-range phones, a common assumption is that budget phones are around 4x slower.</p>
<h2 id="answering-whether-the-web-has-become-slower">Answering whether the web has become slower</h2>
<p>Has the web become slower? Well, it depends on what your device, network connection, and most-used websites are.</p>
<p>We'd need to weigh real-world performance data to get a distribution that shows how different users experienced the web over time. And should the experience of someone opening thousands of pages a day count as much as someone who only visits Facebook once a week?</p>
<p>I don't have detailed per-user data, but we can take a look at the question in a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real-user data from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome UX Report (CrUX)</a></li>
<li>Naive modelling based on how websites and devices have changed</li>
</ol>
<p>I also tried downloading old page versions from archive.org and testing them with Lighthouse, but wasn't able to get meaningful results in the time I had available. For example, often some images are missing from the page archive.</p>
<h2 id="data-from-the-chrome-user-experience-report">Data from the Chrome User Experience Report</h2>
<p>The big limitation of CrUX data is that it's only been collected since late 2017. But we can still use it to see if the web has become slower in the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike HTTP Archive, CrUX looks at the whole domain instead of just homepages.</p>
<p>The data we'll look at is the 75th percentile, meaning pages load at least this fast for 75% of users.</p>
<p>(I'm taking the average across websites rather than the median, which is not great.)</p>
<h3 id="us-page-load-times">US page load times</h3>
<p>CrUX data for the US does not show page performance getting worse.</p>
<p>The onLoad metric shows a slight improvement, maybe due to an increase in bandwidth. Or maybe more activity is now happening after the initial page load.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-us.png" alt="Page load speeds in the US"></p>
<p>The paint metrics seem fairly stable. Largest Contentful Paint is a new metric that has only been collected since mid-2019.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-the-world">The rest of the world</h3>
<p>The downward trend in the US onLoad metric is matched by the global data. There are however signifianct differences in page load times across countries, with onLoad timings in India being almost twice those in South Korea.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-global.png" alt="Page load speeds globally, in the US, UK, Korea, and India"></p>
<p>We can use CrUX data to put HTTP Archive data into perspective. In January 2020 HTTP Archive reported a median (50% percentile) load time of 18.7s, based on its synthetic data.</p>
<p>In contrast, CrUX suggests a load time of just 5.8s –&nbsp;and this is the 75th percentile.</p>
<p>(Note that the Global values here just take an average and are not weighed by population.)</p>
<h2 id="modelling-page-load-times">Modelling page load times</h2>
<p>We can create a theoretical model of how changes in devices, networks, and websites might affect overall performance.</p>
<p>This won't be a great model, but hopefully it will still provide some insight.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-page-download-time">Theoretical page download time</h3>
<p>Page weight has increased over time, but so has bandwidth. Round-trip latency has also gone down.</p>
<p>Downloading a file the size of the median mobile website would have taken 1.7s in 2013. If your connection hasn't improved since then downloading this much data would now take 4.4s. But with an average connection today it would only take 0.9s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/minimum-page-download-time.png" alt="TCP download time"></p>
<p>In practice, a website wouldn't consist of just a single request, and other factors like CPU processing or server latency would also affect how quickly the page loads. The onLoad times reported by HTTP Archive are 2-3 times this lower bound.</p>
<p>But we can still use this as an indicator that reduced latency and increased bandwidth have helped make websites load faster overall.</p>
<p>(I'm starting in 2013 rather than 2011, as the HTTP Archive page weight metric has only been measured consistently since then.)</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>I'm not quite sure how to think about this, but I'll make some guesses anyway.</p>
<p>Someone who used a Galaxy S4 in 2013 and now uses a Galaxy S10 will have seen their CPU processing power go up by a factor of 5. Let's assume that browsers have become 4x more efficient since then. If we naively multiply these numbers we get an overall 20x improvement.</p>
<p>Since 2013, JavaScript page weight has increased 3.7x from 107KB to 392KB. Maybe minification and compression have improved a bit …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

        <article>
          <section><p>Operating systems and file systems have traditionally been developed
hand in hand. They impose mutual constraints on each other. Today we
have two major leaders in file system semantics: Windows and <span>POSIX</span>.
They are very close to each other when compared to the full set of
possibilities. Interesting things happened before POSIX monopolized
file system&nbsp;semantics.</p>

<p>When you use a file system through a library instead of going through
the operating system there are some extra possibilities. You are no
longer required to obey the host operating system’s semantics for
filenames. You get to decide if you use <code>/</code> or <code>\</code> to separate
directory components (or something else altogether). Maybe you don’t
even use strings for filenames. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/weinholt/fs-fatfs">fs-fatfs</a> library uses
a list of strings, so it’s up to the caller to define a directory
separator for themselves. While working on that library, I was driven
to write down some ideas that I’ve previously run across and found&nbsp;inspirational.</p>

<p>The very first hierarchical file system was developed for Multics. It
is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.multicians.org/fjcc4.html">A General-Purpose File System For Secondary Storage</a> (1965)
by Robert C. Daley and Peter G. Neumann. There are several things that I find
astounding about this&nbsp;paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were apparently no hierarchical file systems before Multics.
The references do no cite any previous work on this and I haven’t
found&nbsp;any.</li>
<li>Privacy in computing was a big consideration even back&nbsp;then.</li>
<li>Modern hierarchical file system are essentially unchanged from 1965,
but some features disappeared along the&nbsp;way.</li>
<li>There’s a <em>very</em> interesting backup system described in this&nbsp;paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper describes these concepts that we still use&nbsp;today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files.</li>
<li>Directories.</li>
<li>Root&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Working&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Tree name, i.e. the name of a file or directory in the tree
structure. Akin to&nbsp;realpath(3).</li>
<li>Path name, which is like a tree name, but it is conceptually
different because components can be links. The paper used <code>":"</code>
instead of <code>"/"</code> to separate&nbsp;directories.</li>
<li>Relative paths. They used an initial <code>":"</code> in place of <code>"./"</code> (or
empty) and <code>"*"</code> in place of <code>".."</code>. Instead of <code>"cd .."</code> you used
<code>"CHANGEDIRECTORY :*"</code>.</li>
<li>Symbolic&nbsp;links.</li>
<li>Access control using access control lists (showed up relatively
recently in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>).</li>
<li>Read, execute and write modes on files and directories. Execute
on a directory means permission to search it, just as in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>.</li>
<li>Segments and segment numbers (file descriptions and file
descriptors, respectively, if I’m not&nbsp;mistaken).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is said that Unix took inspiration from Multics and simplified
things. What was lost? Whoever implemented the file system for Unix
stopped reading the paper somewhere around subsection 2.3. There are
at least these features we’re&nbsp;missing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Access control lists can define a <span>TRAP</span> for a user. Users can refuse
to use TRAPs and instead get an error. Otherwise TRAPs call a named
function at the time of the access. They can be used to implement
smart files that can e.g. monitor file usage or apply password-based
file&nbsp;locks.</p>
<p>(Someone will undoubtedly insert eBPF into the Linux <span>VFS</span> soon and we
will have invented TRAPs&nbsp;again).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multics fully separated the append mode and the write mode and made
it available to users. You could actually have files and
<em>directories</em> that were writable but not appendable, or appendable
but not writable (or&nbsp;both).</p>
<p>(Append-only <em>files</em> exist on Linux through file attributes settable
by the super user or processes with <code>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</code>. This is
very weak sauce. Immutable directories exist, but not append-only
directories. And of course there is no way to have a writable file
or directory that can’t&nbsp;grow).</p>
</li>
<li>Directory entries that point to secondary storage. <em>This is a game
changer for file system management.</em> More on this&nbsp;below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiple-level-storage-and-backups">Multiple-level storage and&nbsp;backups</h2>
<p>Files in the Multics file system could have directory entries that
point to a secondary storage medium. At the time the secondary media
were tapes, but today they could be mechanical hard drives, <span>USB</span> drives
or network servers. But what is the point of having a file that isn’t
there? It’s really quite clever and it only gets more clever the more
you look at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>When a Multics system was running out of disk space it could remove
unused files from the primary medium, but keep the directory entries.</strong>
If you then tried to open such a file it would ask you to wait while
the file is being made available. It would issue instructions to the
operator (perhaps later a tape robot) to have them retrieve the
required tapes for restoring the file. Very useful when disks were
small and tapes were&nbsp;plentiful.</p>
<p>But it gets even better when you consider backups. Today if you need
to restore a Linux system from backups you do it this way: find the
oldest full backup and restore it, then restore each incremental
backup, going from oldest to newest. This means that the system can’t
be used until you’ve completely restored it from the backups. With
today’s disk sizes that could take a very, very long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Multics backups are done differently. To restore a completely hosed
system you first restore the system files, which will allow you to
boot. Then you restore the <em>latest</em> incremental backup. After this the
file system will contain the most current directory entries. <strong>Just
restore one incremental backup tape and all the files are already in
their right places. This is <em>much</em> faster than waiting for everything
to be&nbsp;restored!</strong></p>
<p>Why is only the latest incremental backup required to get everything
back in its place and working? The clever part is that the files might
not yet be on the disk. In fact, most files will probably be on
another backup medium. But the most recently used files have been
restored, so you can most likely do useful work already, and all other
files have their directory entries. If you try to open a file that
hasn’t been restored then you’re asked to wait and the operator is
told which tape to put in to get the file&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>Is something like this offered on <em>any</em> <span>POSIX</span>-compatible file&nbsp;system?</p>

<p>The Xerox Alto was also a system of many firsts. It is most famous for
having the first windowing <span>GUI</span>, which inspired Apple’s design, which
then inspired Microsoft’s design. Of course it had a hierarchical file
system with version numbers, and even a network file&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>I would like to highlight the interesting disk structure of the Alto
file system, which is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/an-open-operating-system-for-a-single-user-machine/">An Open Operating System for a Single-User Machine</a> (1979)
by Butler Lampson and Robert F.&nbsp;Sproull.</p>
<p>The designers of the system were concerned about data loss caused by
hardware issues and buggy software. They came up with a feature to
protect the user’s data against loss of any block on the disk. (Unless
the user data was in that lost block, of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>All blocks on the disk have a label that contains these&nbsp;fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>A file&nbsp;identifier</li>
<li>A version&nbsp;number</li>
<li>A page number (block&nbsp;index)</li>
<li>A&nbsp;length</li>
<li>A next link (pointer to the next block in the&nbsp;file)</li>
<li>A previous&nbsp;link</li>
</ul>
<p>The label means that each block is self-identifying. By my count this
type of disk had an additional 14 bytes of label per each 512 byte&nbsp;block.</p>
<p><strong>If the disk structure is damaged then a special program called the
<em>scavenger</em> will iterate over all blocks and recover the structure.</strong>
Contrast this to a file system like ext4 where a damaged structure can
mean that huge swathes of data are rendered&nbsp;inaccessible.</p>
<p><strong>The scavenger was also used to upgrade the disk structure.</strong> Imagine
converting in-place between ext4, btrfs or <span>ZFS</span> by just running a
scavenger for the new disk structure. It would e.g. regard the
existing ext4 metadata as nonsense and build a new disk structure
based on btrfs by using the labels. (It will not work with these
specific file systems, but it demonstrates the&nbsp;principle).</p>
<p>Why don’t we have this today? Nobody wants to build a <span>POSIX</span> file
system that uses labels because the disks we’re using have 512-byte or
4096-byte blocks and no room for a label. A label would have a very
small overhead for each block, but even a very small overhead like
this is not acceptable to file system designers. More seriously, it
would mess up mmap(2). There are disks with slightly larger blocks
meant to store a label, but they are more expensive and not very
common. So we’re left with fragile file system structures and the sage
advice that you’re supposed to have backups anyway (for which, see
previous&nbsp;section).</p>
<p>The best modern alternative is something like Btrfs or <span>ZFS</span>. Blocks are
checksummed and those checksums are stored next to the pointers in the
disk structure. A modern version of the Alto file system should
certainly have checksums, but not using labels gives weaker
protections than what the Alto file system provided. If you want to
see how relevant the Alto file system design is today, just read what
using ZFS protects against, but then remember that it doesn’t use&nbsp;labels.</p>

<p>Hydra is another historical operating system with innovations in the
file system. It is described in the
paper
<a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/os/Qual/papers/hydra.pdf"><span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System</a> (1974)
by W. Wulf, E. Cohen, W. Corwin, A. Jones, R. Levin, C. Pierson, and
F. Pollack at Carnegie-Mellon&nbsp;University.</p>
<p>Hydra does away with the idea of ownership and a hierarchy of ever
more privileged components. It uses a fundamentally different concept
of protection and security than what <span>POSIX</span> is based&nbsp;on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technologists like hierarchical structures – they are elegant; but
experience from the real world shows they are not viable security
structures. The problem, then, which <span>HYDRA</span> attempts to face
squarely, is to maintain order in a nonhierarchical&nbsp;environment.”</p>
<p>– <span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System&nbsp;(1974)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Resources that need protection, such as files, are called <em>objects</em>.
You can apply an <em>operation</em> to an object, such as reading or writing.
But to do so you need a reference to that object, which is called a
<em>capability</em>. You can even know a file’s identity, but without the
reference you can’t do&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>This is similar, but not identical, to a safe programming …</p></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Benjamin Disraeli, speaking in the House of Commons in 1872, said of then Prime Minister William Gladstone’s Cabinet: ‘Behold, a range of extinct volcanoes; not a flame flickers upon a single pallid crest.’ ‘Extinct volcanoes’ would be far too generous a phrase to describe the current crop of Western leaders – if political regimes could be said to decay from the head downwards, then we are in some trouble. The political scientist Wilfred Pareto said that leaders can be divided into two types – lions who are distinguished by their machismo and foxes who are distinguished by their intelligence. In world politics, the lions are on the rampage because the foxes have abandoned the public weal.</p>



<p>In America, the proportion of people who say that they trust government has fallen from about three-quarters in the early 1960s to less than a third today. Across the rest of the West, opinion is moving in the same direction if not quite as sharply.&nbsp;Governance has emerged as a central feature of the Covid-19 crisis: we have learnt that good government can make all the difference between living and dying. One problem with poor government is that it is self-sustaining. The lower government falls in public esteem the more likely it is that able people will shun it. And the more able people shun it the more government becomes a butt of jokes, even the object of outright contempt.</p>



<p>The problem of good government and leadership is nothing new. In the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and early 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;centuries, England’s political system was known as ‘Old Corruption’ because it was so self-serving. An entrenched elite treated the state as a source of jobs and benefits. The state was so disconnected from the forces of industry and commerce that were transforming society that many liberals wanted to reduce government to a night-watchman.&nbsp;These tensions are never far away from the contemporary scene. Modern politicians routinely take up lucrative jobs in the private sector when they leave office – often working for the industries that they once regulated. Indeed,&nbsp;‘reciprocal nepotism’ is now so commonplace on Capitol Hill, with members of Congress giving jobs to the children of friends in return for their friends giving jobs to their children, that Melanie Sloan, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, comments: ‘Members of Congress basically are profit centres for their entire families’.</p>



<p>How did the Victorians shake themselves out of this cycle of decline? A cohort of reforming politicians and educators realised that a successful commercial society required a successful modern state. They suggested a solution: a collective immersion in the wisdom of Plato. They set about revitalising the patronage-ridden civil service and educational world by opening opportunities and jobs to competition.<strong> </strong>They treated Plato’s&nbsp;<em>Republic</em>  as a near deified talisman against&nbsp;the twin evils of self-indulgence and short-termism. In the present day, this spirit requires us to set down self-help guides and leadership manuals in favour of the same text that inspired the Victorians. Not only does Plato provide a comprehensive explanation of why a republic needs a leadership class, he also provides a guide to producing one.</p>



<p>The great philosopher’s starting point is that government&nbsp;<em>matters</em>. A republic is rather like a ship at sea, he says. Whether the ship can survive the ever-changing hazards that confront us – storms, pirates, jagged rocks – depends on the quality of the ship’s leadership. If the ship is well run, then at least it has a chance; if it is badly run, then it will flounder and everybody aboard will drown. What does being ‘well-run’ mean? Plato asks a simple question: should we give the job of steering the ship safely to the members of the crew at large, when they can’t agree on where they’re headed and most of them don’t know the rudiments of navigation? Or should we give it to a captain who has spent his entire life studying&nbsp;‘the seasons of the year, the sky, the stars, the winds and other professional subjects’?</p>



<p>The metaphor of the ship is a way of driving home Plato’s wider point about the importance of ‘guardians’. Plato argues that a successful republic is run by a class of people whose job it is to think about the long-term success of the polis. What threats are there on the horizon? What trade-offs do we need to make in order to ensure success? How might we be scuppered by known unknowns and unknown unknowns? Despite being an aristocrat, Plato argued that potential guardians – or men of gold as he described them – might occur in every class of society – and indeed might be women as well as men. If they are to escape decay, successful societies have to re-allocate leadership positions in each generation. The second job is to train the guardians through a prolonged education that involves not just academic education but also character-training designed to ensure that guardians put the public good above private interests. Morality is arguably even more important than intellect because the leaders possess so much power over everybody’s lives: if they are corrupt they will not only lead the country in the wrong direction – from the light to the darkness in Plato’s view – but will also set a model of corruption that the rest of society will only too happily follow.</p>



<p>If a society run by educated guardians is the best sort of society, in Plato’s view, a society run by the masses is the worst. Plato conceded that democracy is in many ways the most attractive form of society,&nbsp;because it combines the maximum of opportunity for the regular citizen with the maximum of freedom. But these attractions are purely superficial – democracy is like a ‘coat of many colours’, he says, that looks good when you see it in the market but turns out to be threadbare after you’ve worn it a couple of times. Voters invariably favour the short-term over the long-term and the exciting over the wise. And they are usually drawn towards bad leaders – demagogues who can weave wonderful fantasies about the state’s future but are really nothing more than charlatans, lying their way to power or buying votes with other people’s money. Plato was particularly scathing about aristocrat-demagogues who enjoy the advantage of the best education that money can buy but nevertheless prefer to pander to the mob rather than to guide it to the light.</p>



<p>Democracy’s fetishisation of freedom inevitably gives way to anarchy. Fathers pander to their sons, teachers to their pupils, humans to animals, and ‘the minds of the citizens become so sensitive that the least vestige of restraint is resented as intolerable’. Anarchy produces class struggle, as the poor attack the rich and the rich retaliate; class struggle produces war and disorder. When all this becomes intolerable the masses will turn to a dictator who can restore order.</p>



<p>If tyrants are the unavoidable consequence of democracy, they are also the antithesis of philosopher kings. They regard power as an end in itself rather than a means to an end, and they are governed by their passions rather than their reason. Thus the paradox at the heart of tyranny: even though tyrants have absolute power over other people, they have no power over themselves. Slaves to their own passions – ‘ill-governed’ in their own souls as Plato puts it – they use their positions to inflict those passions on the entire population. A tyranny is a psycho-drama in which everyone is caught up in the tyrant’s raging ego.</p>



<p>Many of Plato’s suggestions for producing successful guardians strike us today as at the minimum bizarre.&nbsp;He believed that the guardians should be banned from getting married or owning private property in order to focus their minds on the common good. He was so keen on producing the best guardians that he advocated eugenic breeding programmes (guardians would be compensated for not getting marred by being allowed to participate in regular orgies with women selected for their brains and beauty). But even if he was far-fetched in his solutions, he was right in the problems that he identified. Guardians will cease to be guardians if they put themselves and their families among the public good, degrading public offices and turning the people against them.</p>



<p>William Gladstone, the greatest liberal reformer of the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, believed that, if the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century was the age of the rule of prerogative, and the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century one of rule by patronage, the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century should be ruled by virtue, and Plato was to be the new age’s guiding force.</p>



<p>Gladstone was so fluent in Classical Greek that, in 1858, he gave a speech to the inhabitants of the Ionian Islands (a British protectorate) in the language. Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby and the greatest school reformer of his age, adopted many of Plato’s signature ideas: that education was as much about shaping character as shaping intellect; that group loyalty should trump individual self-expression; and that physical education was as important as book learning. The two most influential civil servants of the age, Charles Trevelyan and Cyril Northcote, abolished patronage in the civil service and introduced open competition in order specifically to promote the rule of a Platonic ‘natural aristocracy’.</p>



<p>Benjamin Jowett, the master of Balliol from 1870 until his death in 1893, devoted his life to two great projects: producing a definitive edition of Plato&nbsp;and turning his college into a production line for Platonic guardians. Though he failed at his first task – his edition of&nbsp;<em>The Republic</em>&nbsp;was only completed after his death by his friend and biographer Lewis Campbell – he succeeded spectacularly at the second. Balliol became the leading educational institution in the empire.&nbsp;Jowett’s pupils included Lord Curzon, a future viceroy of India, Lord Grey, a future foreign secretary, Herbert Asquith, a future prime minister, Cosmo Gordon Lang, a future archbishop of Canterbury and Charles Gore, a future …</p></div></div></div>

				<p>Axial operates a confidential online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of privately held small and medium sized businesses. The platform is 100% software enabled and includes tools and recommendation engines to empower both buyers and sellers to discover, connect and transact with one another. By expanding the reach of both buyers and sellers and eliminating hundreds of hours of manual time spent pursuing an offline transaction process allows deals with the most merit to rise to the top. The platform goes beyond matching the correct individuals and focuses on facilitating success at many levels. A key example of this is the platform's ability to facilitate real human to human interactions with communication on the platform itself.</p><blockquote><em>“Axial at its core is a specialized matching engine and communication platform.”</em></blockquote><p>The ability for the platform to connect people on a deeper level is what has made it a successful medium for completed deals and a major contributor to democratizing capital markets. As Zach Werheim, Director of Engineering at Axial, puts it, “one big goal is to be able to help people where they need it — for those who, otherwise, would never be able to get it."</p><p>Zach is a prominent software engineer and tech leader who has led a number of engineering teams. He, along with the rest of the Axial team, were quick to recognize the rapidly evolving market conditions in the way people communicate. The mindset of their users was changing quickly, and it was critical to provide them with industry best practices and features.</p><p>The Axial platform has served their customers for over 10 years. In that time they’ve endeavored to maintain best practices while evolving with emerging technologies. Their philosophy of pushing innovation results in a couple of issues arising that the team must address.</p><p><em><strong>1. Ensuring institutional knowledge isn’t lost over time.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>2. Making it easy to adopt the newest best technologies.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>3. Making their tooling accessible to their developers.</strong></em></p><p>Applications being built and improved over the course of a decade are always at risk of institutional knowledge being lost. It is paramount that developer and operations workflows and processes are common knowledge and not siloed. Additionally, over the course of the last decade, there are a new set of tools and processes which represent best practices. A core facet of engineering at Axial is to adopt the latest best practices to empower their development team to perform at their highest.</p><blockquote><br><em>Zach was on a mission to make it easier for their development team to adopt optimal tooling without silos and individual points of failure. This would empower their dev team to make the best technology choices while ensuring that the tool knowledge was collaborative and distributed. The solution was creating their own workflows meshed with the optimal tools for their day-to-day operations.</em><br></blockquote><p>After evaluating multiple tools with limited success, the team came across <a href="https://cto.ai/platform">The Ops Platform by CTO.ai</a>. The Ops Platform allowed them to start building solutions immediately by creating and automating developer workflows. These workflows were sharable with the entire team and could plug into any specific developer tooling that was necessary. They did this via Slack workflows and the CTO.ai SlackOps capability. Axial built 3 initial Ops to empower their engineering teams right away: The Dev Op, The Vault Op, and The Cluster Op.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="1-the-dev-op">1. The Dev Op</h3><p>The engineering team leverages VMs which run in AWS, which also run most of their services for development. Their Dev Command controls the state of their DevBox for AWS cost savings. When the development team isn’t active, it can easily be turned off or turn on, on demand. The team also implemented an automatic shut off. Because it’s built as an Op, the team can run these suites of commands directly from Slack and avoid having to interface with the AWS Console or other specific services.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WJ21lVtgdBCuga-WYA2xJc8h3LQUojaozdTE7cuiVgfVYtDC80LbgJRN0D1_gMul3ekbXDjS3zMwLXszGVPEGzwMOWVcRYSO6nXbTRbYIfw90_7zeRCAnBtiEZhIjThFDvNPGC3A"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br>

The <em>Dev </em>Op specifically helped save on their AWS bill by making it easy for the team to activate development services only when necessary. Across the 5 DevBoxes, Zach is able to save over 12 hours of uptime per day, which equates to a savings of over $5,900 annually. The Ops Platform made it simple to build—not only to save money, but also to streamline development for the rest of the engineering team and save developer hours.</p><blockquote><em>“Without CTO.ai, we would have to adopt the bare minimum tooling. Anything new would have to be written in a language our team was familiar with and we’d be running scripts manually. Having this technology available is going to make it easier to develop dev operations around new systems. It’s definitely going to be a big advantage for us going forward”</em></blockquote><div><p>Zach plans to continue to build key Ops to empower the rest of his team. Specifically, a production release pipeline. In addition, there are a lot of fragmented utility scripts their team uses to run various operations. These scripts currently sit in a folder and eventually become outdated as infrastructure changes. “Opifying” these would allow them to be version controlled and give the entire team more visibility. Zach has also thought about ways to empower other departments of the organization with Ops. One of their next plans for Ops is to build an “extremely simple and impossible to screw up” SlackOp to empower their marketing department to perform an operation they would usually need the assistance of engineering for. This Op would be trackable, so the engineering team would have visibility into what is being run, but the marketing team would be unblocked to continue their tasks. </p><p>Adopting Ops has allowed Axial to immediately reduce their cloud spend, enable easier adoption of new technologies, and even open the door to empowering non-engineers to run operations. Ultimately, this allows the engineering team to focus on their core competency in the pursuit of their own market innovation instead of spending time and resources on infrastructure and tooling.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><em>Contact us to understand how much time and money workflows can save your team:</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--[if lte IE 8]>

				<div><p><span>In the winter of 1938, deep into the Depression,&nbsp;eight-year-old Verne was put on a train and sent 2,000 miles east, to the Ontario School for the Blind. It was when Verne was in the school’s hospital for six weeks with scarlet fever that he first heard the sound of a piano being tuned – the intervals being stretched and shortened. It was a pinging sound, not quite musical, and hardly melodic.</span></p>
<p><span>Once he had recovered,Verne sought out the school’s tuning shop. As it happened, he had a near perfect ear, and he studied the craft of piano tuning with rigor and determination.</span></p>
<p><span>Years later, Verne often took to quoting his tuning teacher, J. D. Ansell, whose favorite aphorism was “The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.” To give Verne experience, Ansell started taking his young protégé into town to tune pianos in private homes. Verne was allowed to keep the money – $2.50 per piano, and sometimes, when he got lucky, $3.00 – which he put toward some basic tools: a tuning wrench, a tuning fork, needle-nose pliers, gauges for measuring the diameter of piano wire, and rubber wedges for muting strings.</span></p>
<p><span>After graduating from high school at age 19, Verne knew his best chance at a job was to find work as a chipper in one of the many piano factories in Toronto (in the early 20th century the city directory listed no fewer than sixteen piano manufacturers). The chippers were the first tuners to work on a newly strung piano, so incomplete in construction that it still had no keys. Those initial tunings are done, first with a pitch fork, then by ear, by plucking the strings with a small chip of wood.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne started out as an apprentice chipper in the factory of the Winter Company, one of piano manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span>He had a fishing tackle box that he had converted to a tuner’s toolbox. Over the years Verne collected dozens of tools. Some he bought from old-timers, and others he adapted from other trades. He had surgical forceps and dental explorers, which made dandy hooks, opticians’ screwdrivers for adjusting harpsichords, barber scissors for trimming felt, and shoemaker pegs for plugging holes. From the welding trade he took soapstone, a dry lubricant for the buckskin that can squeak in the action of older pianos.</span></p>
<p><span>After being laid off, Verne decided to go door-to-door, tuning pianos. He was systematic, choosing a sequence of different neighborhoods around Toronto that he could reach by street car. Verne soon grew bolder and began cold-calling at sergeants’ messes,&nbsp;asylums, and prisons. He would walk a mile and a half in a snowstorm to tune a piano, and charge $3 for a tuning. He was lucky to get one tuning a day. “That’s how things were,” he recalled years later. “I was glad to get the work. During that time you did what you could.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 1952, at the age of 21, Verne was hired as a fine-tuner in the Heintzman factory, then the largest piano manufacturer in Canada.&nbsp;Verne’s tuning always stood out, even when he was tuning pianos for the first time. To trained ears, the quality of Verne’s tuning was always superior.</span></p>
<p><span>In 1961, he moved to the T. Eaton Co., to take over as the concert tuner. Verne liked to think he could take a piano beyond mere sound, into realms of color. And he liked to think he was giving people a glimpse of that color every time he tuned a piano. Muriel Mussen, who ran the concert department, sat in a small office off the showroom floor,&nbsp;and&nbsp;came to recognize Verne’s spare style of tuning whenever she heard it. Unlike many tuners, who banged a key as hard as they could, he kept it gentle, careful not to hit the key any harder than he had to. Halfway into a piano, Verne would often hear Miss Mussen call out, “I know it’s you tuning out there, Verne.”</span></p>
<p><span>One afternoon about a year after Verne started at Eaton’s,&nbsp;Miss Mussen sent him across town to Glenn Gould’s apartment to tune Gould’s old Chickering. All Gould wanted, he told Verne, was for the tuner to do what had been done hundreds of times before: get the piano into playable condition, if only for the time being. But Verne refused, telling Gould that the tuning pins were so loose they needed to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne’s stubborn insistence on doing things his way had endeared him to Gould, and the encounter galvanized what was to become a decades-long association between a pianist and his technician.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne tuned for many famous musicians over the years, including Duke Ellington, Arthur Rubinstein, Rudolf Serkin, Victor Borge, and Liberace. But it was the business he got from Gould that eventually enabled him to quit Eaton’s employ and sustain his family for two decades.</span></p>
<p><span>Each tolerated the other’s idiosyncracies, which were in ample evidence in both men. Gould’s quirks, of course, were legion and legendary. One of their earliest conversations was about Verne’s physical limitations. “I can’t see very well, but I get the job done,” Verne told Gould. And Gould replied that of this he had no doubt. Nothing further on the topic was ever said.</span></p>

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease. </p><p id="viewer-9g65f">Even if we can prove some causation, we then need to assume that correcting the Vitamin D deficiency will prevent the disease. This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem. </p><h3 id="viewer-399rj"><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-4p68a">Fortunately we have studies that can help figure this out. Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT).</strong> An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos.

Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. </p><p id="viewer-f6k24"><strong>The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death. </strong>These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies. </p><p id="viewer-3cooc"><strong>Even in studies of bone health, Vitamin D has been disappointing.</strong> We already know that Vitamin D is essential in calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.</p><h3 id="viewer-ct6r5"><strong>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ek5t0">Large randomized controlled trials are currently the best way to evaluate a treatment, but they are difficult to do. If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis. </p><p id="viewer-ab05u">Meta-analyses have exploded in popularity over the last few decades.<span> If done well, a meta-analysis of a group of trials can reveal insights that cannot be seen in the individual trials. Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).</span></p><p id="viewer-9nlvf"><span>In addition, <strong>publication bias</strong> may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies. </span></p><div id="viewer-9ul9t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_373,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a6n1n"> <em>Where negative studies go to die. </em></p><p id="viewer-a6bj6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosenthal_(psychologist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Robert Rosenthal </u></em></a><em>called publication bias "the file drawer problem" because important negative studies often end up here.

One of the major challenges in performing these analyses is deciding which studies to include or exclude. Ideally only high-quality, well-designed, well-executed studies will be included. Researchers do not always agree on which studies to include, and differences in inclusion criteria have led to similar meta-analyses producing opposite results. </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115934" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>This has occurred</u></a> <span>in studies of Vitamin D and fracture risk in older adults, with some meta-analyses showing zero benefit to Vitamin D and others showing a decreased risk of fracture, even though they included many of the same studies. </span></p><p id="viewer-donuf"><span>In addition to being high quality, the included studies should all try to answer the same clinical question. Many meta-analyses can only be done by combining trials that differ in important details, like the age of participants, treatment dosages, or definition of endpoints. Combining these may be feasible, but the clinical relevance may change when disparate groups are lumped together. For example, suppose we want to know if Vitamin D prevents asthma attacks in children. If a meta-analysis shows a small benefit to Vitamin D when all ages are combined, but the individual small studies in children did not show a benefit, what do I advise a 10 year old with asthma?</span></p><p id="viewer-9le66">Despite these challenges, meta-analyses of RCTs can provide meaningful insights. Unfortunately, most high-quality meta-analyses show similar results to our individual randomized controlled trials: <strong>Vitamin D does not appear to prevent disease in healthy adults.</strong> </p><p id="viewer-9hssp">But there are a few promising areas identified in meta-analyses.

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

<figcaption>Becoming and Unbecoming. Macintosh Operating System 10.14.6, Preview.App 10.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist manually constructed the image in the <em>Portable PixMap</em> (PPM) format using the <em>Sublime</em> text editor, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>P3

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert ii.ppm ii.gif
</code></pre>

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<pre><code>P3

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i iii.ppm iii.gif
</code></pre>

<figure>

<figcaption>Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

<figcaption>The Cobbler. Sublime Text 3.2.2, as 10.0.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Camera Obscura. oK, iKe, Safari 12.1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<pre><code>w:h:5

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<!-- For the record, this GIF was created in the Windows version of Krita 4.30. Thanks, Michal! -->

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<figcaption>Composition in Blue and Blue. Gnuplot 5.2, Sublime Text 3.2.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

Before you can install them, you will need a Postgres database. How do you pick the right Postgres for your application? There are a bewildering variety of possible ways to acquire a database running on a Postgres instance, but the biggest choice is “build or buy”: whether to install a Postgres version on your own or to purchase it as a service.</p><p>lakeFS is yet another Postgres application, so it requires a Postgres database. At Treeverse we decided for now to buy Postgres as a service. I’ll explain the factors why we decided, and how you might decide to whether or not to follow us.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#got-a-postgres"></a>Got a Postgres?</h2><p>If your organization already runs Postgres instances, they may well be the best choice: there can be extensive in-house experience and expertise already present. And you probably don’t need this guide.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expensive-as-a-service"></a>Expensive as a Service?</h2><p>The most common objection to buying a database as a service is sheer price: a DB instance from your cloud provider can cost more than&nbsp;<em>twice</em>&nbsp;the cost of the virtual machine instance that it runs on. Obviously you pay extra to get much more than just the virtualized resources: you get expertise, much of the ops, easier backup and clustering, sometimes even some features.</p><p>For pricing I believe we should prefer to&nbsp;<em>buy</em>&nbsp;what is not a core part of our business. Pricing can actually make this decision easy. If the cost of buying Postgres as a service is a significant expenditure, then necessarily it is a core part of business — and clearly we need to develop the requisite in-house capability to support it. Otherwise cost is not a driving factor in the decision.</p><p>Even if you decide Postgres is a core capability for your organization, you may wish buy Postgres as a service for an initial ramp-up period, planning to move away later. While migrating database installations generally requires some downtime, this too is often a good choice.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#choices"></a>Choices</h2><p>Every cloud provider provides managed Postgres as a service:</p><ul><li>AWS provide RDS as well as clustered Postgres-compatible Aurora;</li><li>Azure provide Azure Database for PostgreSQL;</li><li>GCP provide Postgres on Cloud SQL</li></ul><p>Similarly, some hosting providers also have a Postgres as a service offering. If you are already using a hosting provider that offers Postgres — Heroku is one example — this can be a convenient choice.</p><p>Postgres maintain a page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/professional_hosting/">PostgreSQL: Hosting Providers</a>&nbsp;that list a wide range of options for purchasing hosted solutions along with support. Additionally, many hosted application platforms offer Postgres.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expertise-and-ops"></a>Expertise and Ops</h2><p>Developing in-house expertise is often desirable, and not only as a means to save costs. For instance, by allowing rapid resolution of issues without having to go outside the organization, expertise reduces risk.</p><p>On the flip side, managing your in-house database carries an ops burden, which will include monitoring, backup, clustering, and versioning. The last can be particularly troubling: occasionally you&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;need to upgrade Postgres on a running system.</p><p>A middle ground between buying a service and building it yourself is to contract the setup but manage ops in-house. I believe that unless you do database-related development, databases are generally a poor fit for this middle ground alternative. Contracting only the setup means you will take longer to build expertise in the database. Meanwhile you already start carrying the ops burden of the database.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions-and-extensions"></a>Versions and Extensions</h2><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions"></a>Versions</h3><p>Buying from a large service provider appears to limit available versions. Currently, for example, the latest supported Postgres version is 12.4; the major release Postgres 12 was on 2019-10-03. Service providers have been slow to provide version 12:</p><ul><li>AWS RDS started supporting Postgres version 12 on 2020-03-31, and supports Postgres versions 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10, and 11; however Aurora clusters do not support version 12 yet;</li><li>Azure still supports only versions 9.5, 9.6, 10.11, and 11.6;</li><li>GCP started providing Postgres version 12 on 2020-05-21;</li><li>ElephantSQL supports Postgres version 12, but the free tier provides version 11.9.</li></ul><p>At the same time service providers can upgrade Postgres (and underlying OS) versions more transparently. This can be particularly useful for receiving patch releases. So low availability of newer Postgres versions is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a significant detriment. Of course, certain applications may require an absolutely latest version of Postgres, which may make it impossible to buy Postgres service.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#extensions"></a>Extensions</h3><p>Numerous extensions are available for Postgres. Service providers provide the most popular of these. But they cannot provide all of them, and typically it is not possible to install new extensions that require compilation.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#applicability-to-lakefs"></a>Applicability to lakeFS</h3><p>To allow users flexibility, lakeFS requires only Postgres 11. So availability of versions and extensions does not influence choice of provider for a database intended to run only lakeFS.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#provisioning"></a>Provisioning</h2><p>Creating a new database instance with a service provider requires plenty of time. For example, on AWS RDS creating a small empty database instance can take 10 minutes. This is very reasonable for one-time setup of long-lived production and even staging environments.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#fast-setup-of-small-databases"></a>Fast setup of small databases</h3><p>For short-lived environments or for testing, it can take too long to set up a hosted database. Luckily Postgres is an isolated component and one installation may easily be replaced with another installation. If the database is small and the generated data is not particularly valuable then there are good alternatives with quick setup times. These include creating a new database on an existing Postgres database instance or even — when database instance performance is not critical — running a database instance inside a container. If you have permission to create a new database, both of these alternatives have equivalent setup times that are typically less than a second.</p><p>Using an existing database instance allows you to take advantage of existing setup and ops on that database instance. For example, it will be easy to backup your new database if the database already has backups, and clustering exists at the instance level. By the same token, an existing database instance will offer significantly lower isolation than a container.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>An example of creating new databases inside an existing database instance is the ElephantSQL free tier: you are allocated a database inside an existing instance and can see that other databases exist inside that instance. It uses Postgres roles to prevent data leakage (a side effect is that some operations are impossible, for instance any application that requires multiple roles).</p><p>An example of running a database instance inside a container is when running tests. Every test can create its own blank container running Postgres. This is probably the best solution for component testing: it offers complete isolation between tests, the database container is small, and it scales directly with the number of running tests.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#what-did-we-pick"></a>What did we pick?</h2><p>All our lakeFS instances currently use plain or Aurora Postgres on RDS:</p><ul><li>Our database usage is currently not high enough to justify the cost savings of running our own instances..</li><li>We build lakeFS, and supporting Postgres as a service is important to the product. So by design, lakeFS does not require latest-version features or esoteric extensions.</li><li>Our core business is currently to develop rather than to operate lakeFS; this is essentially the “ramp-up” time above.</li></ul><p>For isolation and speed of setup, our unit and component testing use a containerized Postgres instance.</p><figure><img src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="407" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w"><figcaption>Picking a database, like picking an elephant, can be hard but need not be intimidating</figcaption></figure></div><!-- .entry-content .clear --></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

					<p>The LinkedIn Ads network is likely awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic that make the platform’s value extremely dubious, according to a new study from global digital agency RMG that the company shared exclusively with me.</p>

For the test, RMG promoted a webinar by targeting c-certain c-suite executives at large companies in the United States based on their job titles. The ad encouraged them to click to sign up for for event for free.</p>
<p>The first issue the agency found was the projected versus actual cost per click. LinkedIn estimated a $25 average CPC. The actual campaign CPC was nearly $45.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of forecasting if you project one cost and then the actual cost ends up being 200% the projection?” Gellis asks in the video.</p>
<p>But the real issue was the source of the clicks themselves. LinkedIn’s ad platform reported 11 clicks. RMG’s logs showed ten clicks. <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStory</a>, the digital experience analytics platform that RMG uses, stated that eight people registered for the webinar. However, the true number of registrations was zero.</p>
<p>“Zero people signed up for the webinar from that specific campaign,” Gellis told me in an interview. “That’s kind of the punch line and why I believe this is newsworthy. Nobody signed up. In fact, nobody even exhibited what I believe is real user behavior on the site after clicking the ad. That is also true of all the other ads we ran on LinkedIn. We had a total of 0 people ever “sign up” on any ad we ran during our testing on LinkedIn — regardless of the ad format or messaging.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rmgmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RMG</a> suspects bot activity or misattributed misclicks had been the cause because visitors would bounce away from the webinar’s landing page before it even had a chance to render — in other words, they would click the LinkedIn advertisement and then leave the website in less than 1.3 seconds. In addition, FullStory reported mouse movements that were nothing like what an actual human would do.</p>
<p>“As far as we’re concerned, the LinkedIn ad network basically has fraudulent clicks and/or misclicks that don’t get attributed to the users that are being passed through as leads in campaigns,” Gellis says in the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the simple size in RMG’s one-day test was extremely small. The target audience size was 16,000. The number of impressions would be between 680 and 2,000. The cost was $250. But Gellis told me that the results match a prior, larger test.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png" alt="linkedin ads" width="660" height="197" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 660 197'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png"></p>
<p>During a $3,000 campaign in March, LinkedIn reported 256 clicks with an average CPC of $11. The company received zero leads from all of the clicks.</p>
<p>“You’ll see the call to action is ‘Request Demo,'” Gellis said. “So, arguably, a user who sees this ad and clicks legitimately on it will be looking to get a demo of the analytics tool we were marketing. If the ads were giving us behavior like this on a $3,000-per-month budget, it’s unlikely they would have performed any better with additional budget.”</p>
<p>RMG charges that LinkedIn’s advertising is on a closed network and does not follow the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-measurement-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards for digital advertising</a>. (The IAB did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>
<p>After reviewing RMG’s findings, a LinkedIn spokesperson sent me the following company statement.</p>
<p>“LinkedIn is a members-first organization and our&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFsmfrYAHwHhV6tM-nG54kogFWEw">Ads program</a></u>&nbsp;is designed to ensure that only high-quality, relevant ads are served to our members. We prohibit the use of bots or other automated fraudulent methods to access our services, as they are in violation of the&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErEgCF6J2mC2B2u6Rnd32Ialafiw">User Agreement.</a></u>&nbsp;Additionally, LinkedIn is a&nbsp;member of the IAB&nbsp;and works closely with the organization and its members to help develop standards for the digital advertising industry.”</p>
<p>But when summarizing his findings in the video, Gellis is skeptical of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>“As far as we can tell, LinkedIn is basically a money pit,” he says. “You’re not going to get the performance that you would expect out of the network.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Computer vision is an incredibly fast growing field, and recent developments have made it possible to quickly start experimenting with almost no previous experience. In this post we’ll show you how to set up a practical computer vision analytic system using the $99 Nvidia Jetson Nano Developers Kit, running OpenDataCam. With OpenDataCam we can recognise, track and count people and a variety of vehicles from a USB webcam feed. We will send the collected data to InfluxDB for visualization and analysis, and set up the Jetson Nano for remote operation and management using a cellular modem and a Hologram SIM.<br></p><p>The video below shows a recording of a live field test I did outside a filling station, counting vehicles and pedestrians travelling in different directions.<br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/bjrMs8JFYdo">https://youtu.be/bjrMs8</a><br></p><p>To get started, you will need the following hardware:</p><ul role="list"><li>Jetson Nano Developers kit</li><li>5V 4A Power Supply with barrel connector</li><li>Micro SD Card, class 10 or better, 64 GB recommended</li><li>Wi-Fi adaptor (<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15449">Edimax N150</a> or <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15841">Intel 8265.NGWMG M.2 card</a> recommended) or Ethernet cable</li><li>USB Webcam</li><li>4G Modem - USB or Raspberry Pi Hat (Tested with D-Link DWM-222)</li><li>Hologram SIM Card</li><li>HDMI monitor</li><li>USB Mouse and Keyboard</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f2c5dacd16d7c48f0c455f9_20200724_143026.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><h2>How to set up the Nvidia Jetson Nano<br></h2><p>The Nvidia Jetson Nano is a powerful little single board computer with a GPU for running neural networks to do things like image classification, object detection or speech processing. It’s size and low cost means that it’s perfect for edge computing applications like retail analytics or various industrial uses. Combined with a cellular modem and USB webcam, it allows for quick and easy remote deployments, with the only field requirement being a power supply.<br></p><p>The Jetson Nano has no shortage of documentation and online resources, with Nvidia really having put effort into making machine learning approachable for almost anyone. It’s possible to get a basic object demo running in <a href="https://news.developer.nvidia.com/realtime-object-detection-in-10-lines-of-python-on-jetson-nano/">10 lines of python code</a>.</p><ol role="list"><li>Download the latest <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads">SD card image</a> for the Jetson Nano</li><li>Flash the image to the SD Card from your computer. On a Windows PC I prefer <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">BalenaEtcher</a>. If you haven’t done this before, complete instructions are on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#write">Nvidia website</a>.</li><li>If you're using the barrel socket power supply, place a jumper on the J48 pins, just behind the barrel socket. This deactivates the micro USB port as a power supply.</li><li>Insert the micro SD card into the slot on the Nano</li><li>Plug in the power supply, mouse, keyboard, and Wi-Fi adaptor or network cable<br></li></ol><p>The Jetson should now start up, and direct you through the system and network configuration, and login credentials set up. On the user setup page select the “Log in automatically” to allow all services to start without user intervention.<br></p><p>Once done, you should see the desktop. Open a terminal window and do the following:</p><p>Check for updates, and update all packages. This might take a while.</p><p><code>
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>Install the Nano text editor and curl</p><p><code>
sudo apt install nano curl
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>For deployment a cellular connection is really convenient, but for testing and initial setup and ethernet or WiFi connection is quicker to set up. If you are using a Wi-Fi adaptor for testing, disable Wi-Fi power management to improve connection stability.</p><p><code>
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>It will open a file with the following file</p><p><code>
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 3
</code></p><p>Disable Wi-Fi power saving by changing <strong>3</strong> to <strong>2</strong>.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>Get the IP address of your Jetson Nano by running</p><p><code>
ifconfig
</code></p><p>Restart the Jetson before continuing. Any command line operation from this point forward can be done either directly on the Nano with the keyboard, mouse and monitor, or you can use SSH from any computer on the same network.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you have a running Nano, it’s time to jump into the computer vision software.<br></p><h2>How to Install OpenDataCam</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam">OpenDataCam</a> is an open source tool for computer vision analytics, that can track and count objects in almost any video feed. It is probably the easiest to use and setup tool that I have seen for this purpose. It is licensed under the permissive MIT license, which allows for use in commercial products.</p><p>‍<br>OpenDataCam runs on the Docker platform, and requires access to CUDA, Nvidia’s tool for running parallel processing tasks on GPUs. First we need to make sure CUDA is defined in the PATH on the Nano, by editing the <em>.bashrc</em> file</p><p><code>
sudo nano .bashrc
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Add the following two lines to the end of the file, then save and close it.</p><p><code>
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
</code></p><p>Increase swap partition size of the Jetson to 6 GB to improve performance and reliability</p><p><code>
git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile
cd installSwapfile
chmod 777 installSwapfile.sh
./installSwapfile.sh
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Install Docker-compose and dependencies</p><p><code>
sudo apt install -y python3-pip libssl-dev libffi-dev python-openssl
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
</code></p><p>Allow docker to run on startup</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable docker
</code></p><p>Install OpenDataCam. You will be asked for your sudo password during this process, and it may take a while.</p><p><code>
mkdir ~/opendatacam
cd ~/opendatacam
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/v3.0.1/docker/install-opendatacam.sh
chmod 777 install-opendatacam.sh
./install-opendatacam.sh --platform nano
</code></p><h2>How to configure OpenDataCam</h2><p>Once the installation is complete, open Chromium and go to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network. Once OpenDataCam has started, you will see the following video feed. It is a demo file included in OpenDataCam and demonstrates its object detection capabilities. We’ll use this as an example to get familiar with the interface before changing the video feed for our specific use case.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889973b49b0b09f6e922_UFzR3FTem-uv1i--ef_6ImhdEpBDpt2KfhSRH-nKZV0pb-fzcXfRg8O0PQY3TbOj2PztqHk-4w3Vd2TxSfclRoaW-4s2Y4LzfuUgjATLtWqQF4bczSNDX8J6xo4QGwdqlm1tRpqq.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Click on the “Pathfinder” button in the upper left corner, and you will see the “tracks” generated by each car as it’s identified and tracked.<br></p><p>To count the vehicles, click the “Counter” button to add counting lines as shown below. These lines act as checkpoints, counting objects that pass over them. In the example below, I’ve added lines for oncoming, leaving, and crossing traffic. You can also toggle the direction of travel for objects to be counted, by clicking on the arrow in the centre of the line. To start counting, click the “Start recording” button.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298899354fcf9d9df68f0d_GLWKyNi1Xs8Jq7lWGDHkCKCNnvh9syNBk2Lk-1gC1OEQEvHgJEs21VJ8oPYtk1Wc-nbns8Kj_GdcqaA25lKE2UaPU82ZRAQzUcFRCuBuUh23XW0RZsZaK3c3CIqIKH6-UhMRzuhd.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>To increase the reliability of the counters, it is important to place them in areas with high detection confidence. By clicking the hamburger menu in the upper right-hand corner, you can activate the tracker accuracy heatmap, which will highlight the areas with the <strong>lowest</strong> detection confidence levels.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f2988983b96a20a4ae37c21_D6BXJhyf_Dj-V7Ee6Xfa5q2Np7CTB_E5WITOkrOwuLSi73JBZjK2gWLf5Iz36E1Bn71D6-om6ao_-lE2HugxczT_NT_y0ojc_2DHNJGRQnvQ3adJOsHddTUM8LhB3z7tXt8GVYzL.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889972d197251894544b_BuLB_wQ_upuv3Vg3rZMNuyXJmQ0GNx0UyaJB5cmIJ-uJbQEcKPVdKE56PmnNvJBW_ft_Dl2oio5QcaScWLRZoK506Yx-L4BfFnNc8uAo4cmMGXlW1jBLDMBAA_D5DD02V-ZifngK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This means that you should avoid these areas when placing counting lines. It might also be a good idea to move the camera to a different perspective, or even improve the detection model using <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/training-yolo-for-object-detection-in-pytorch-with-your-custom-dataset-the-simple-way-1aa6f56cf7d9">transfer learning</a>.<br></p><p>If you have a sample video file that you want to test, you can simply drag and drop it into the OpenDataCam window and it will start playing the new file.<br></p><p>To use a webcam or IP camera stream, you need to <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">edit the config.json</a> file in ~/opendatacam/ to specify the desired video source. Complete details are available on the <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">OpenDataCam Github page</a>, including all the other settings you can change. For now will stick to the demo file while we link all the different parts of the project together, and I will describe the final setup I did for deployment at the end of the post.</p><p>To load and updated config file, restart the Docker container</p><p><code>
sudo docker-compose restart
</code></p><h2>How to Install Node-RED for Cloud Data Collection and Analysis</h2><p>I want to collect traffic data in set intervals and store it for analysis. InfluxDB is a database solution built specifically for time series data, which is exactly what we get from OpenDataCam. It also has some built-in visualisation tools. You can install and run InfluxDB locally on the Jetson, but in a production environment we will likely have multiple sources of data, so sending it to the cloud for analysis makes more sense.<br></p><p>OpenDataCam provides a simple but effective <a href="https://opendatacam.github.io/opendatacam/apidoc/">API </a>for interacting with it and extracting data, but we need to create a simple app to do this. I’ll be using Node-RED, flow-based GUI wrapper for Node.js, which also allows us to see at a glance how data flows through the app, and quickly make changes</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298898cf4cb2839161f831_wUmPP-WAF2sNZpv2qt-pTAv6j4twJzsVmUR3MPQSDpX9roRV8JLq8PxcGqSejBnJc7z-RTxFWb7XIFEDAJNGIBgcPjBmHh4DDmMNuapQ3jL2agcDopb5UghwI4yRnsSB_TFLrEIp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The above screenshot gives you a good idea of how the flow works. First it checks the status of OpenDataCam (ODC), and starts it if it is not running yet, and if no recording is active, it starts one. If a recording is running, it retrieves the recording and then stop it, and immediately starts a new recording. The data from the completed recording is retrieved, and sent to InfluxDB.<br></p><p>This process is repeated at intervals set in the blue <em>timestamp</em> inject node. The dark green nodes provide output for debugging purposes.<br></p><p>To install Node-RED, open a terminal on your Jetson, and run:</p><p><code>
bash (curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
</code></p><p>Install additional nodes for easy interaction with InfluxDB</p><p><code>
cd ~/.node-red &amp;&amp; npm install node-red-contrib-stackhero-influxdb-v2
</code></p><p>We want to let Node-RED start automatically when the Jetson starts</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
</code></p><p>Start Node-RED as a background service</p><p><code>
node-red-start
</code></p><p>Open the Node-RED UI by going to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network.</p><p>To import the flow, click the menu icon in the upper right corner, and select <em>Import</em>.</p><p>Copy the flow code from this <a href="https://github.com/CuriousMongoose/opendatacam-nodered-influxdb/blob/master/nodered-flow.json">GitHub repo</a>, paste it into the import window, and click <em>Import</em>. The flow will now show in your Node-RED editor. Before we can deploy it, we need to set up InfluxDB to receive data, and get its authentication details.</p><h2>How to configure InfluxDB Cloud</h2><p>Now we need to set up a InfluxDB instance to receive the data. First go to the <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/">InfluxDB Cloud page</a>, register for a free account, and create an instance on the cloud platform of your choice. I used AWS.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889817f6f13ef9861283_iy66hKVJonggHuEE97zGCmEVwrBnvAR0HzJKug2-sTenFZKkAqmzCzpErKJZ_FLEBe6JGaS8v3kr9Kg05pUCwDJKJtK-cwoFw27Jr4ULD90M90_tiYSn5X5kffZhbMXp1udSCsFR.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Once the instance is created and you are logged in, go to the <em>Buckets</em> tab on the <em>Dat…</em></p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Secrets in version control systems (VCS) like git is the current state of the world <strong>despite widely being recognized as a bad practice</strong>. Once source code enters a git repository, it can organically spread into multiple locations. This includes any secrets that may be included within. But why then are secrets in git repositories so common? </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>This is the second in a series of articles about secrets within source code and will look specifically at why secrets within git repositories is such a plague, why it is so dangerous and how to prevent it. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="1"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-end-up-in-git">Why secrets end up in git</h2><p>A seasoned developer may be scratching their heads wondering why anyone may put secrets inside a git repository. <strong>But the fact is, secrets inside git repositories is the current state of the world. </strong></p><p><a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secret-sprawl/">Last article</a> we talked about how it is common to choose the path of least resistance when it comes to accessing and distributing secrets. <strong>Git acts as the central point of truth for a project</strong>, so it makes sense, at least from a convenience point of view, that secrets are stored inside a private git repository to make distribution and access easy. </p><blockquote>But storing secrets like this is playing with fire, it only takes a very small incident to get burnt. </blockquote><p>In addition to intentionally storing secrets in git, <strong>when secrets are not managed properly, it is very easy to lose track of them</strong>. Secrets may be hardcoded into source code, stored as text file, shared over Slack or buried inside a debug application log. In addition, developers can be in large distributed teams with access to a plethora of secrets while being faced with reduced release cycles and an ever growing number of technologies to master. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="2"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-in-git-is-dangerous">Why secrets in git is dangerous</h2><p>Source code, we have to remember, is very leaky. Code is copied and transferred everywhere. Git is designed in a way that allows, even promotes, code to be freely distributed. </p><p>Projects can be cloned onto multiple machines, forked into new projects, &nbsp;distributed to customers, made public so on and so forth. <strong>Each time it’s duplicated on git, the entire history of that project is also duplicated.</strong></p><p>Why storing secrets in public repositories is bad will be obvious. They are freely available to everyone on the internet and it is very easy to monitor public repositories, GitHub has a public API to fetch all public commits for example. <br></p><p><strong>But what about private git repositories?</strong><br></p><p>Private repositories don’t publish your source code to the internet openly, but it doesn’t have adequate protection to store such sensitive information either. <strong>Imagine if there was a plain text file with all your credit card numbers within it, you hopefully wouldn’t put this into the companies git repository, secrets are just as sensitive. </strong></p><p><strong>A few things to consider when storing secrets in private repositories:</strong></p><ul><li>Everyone in the organization with access to the repo has access to the secrets within (one compromised account can provide an attacker access to a trove of secrets).</li><li>Repositories can be cloned onto multiple machines or forked into new projects.</li><li>Private repositories can be made public which can have secrets buried in the git history.</li></ul><p>Another important consideration is that <em><strong>code removed from a git repository is never actually gone.</strong></em></p><p>Git keeps track of all changes that are made. Code that is removed - or more technically correct: code that is committed over - still exists within the git history.</p><p>Interestingly enough, code is removed from a project at near equal volume that is added. This means that the code within repositories are much deeper than the first layer and secrets could be buried deep within the git history under a mass of commits that have been long forgotten. </p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iPPNU4jrj_CRg3G1zdZ8dFranXUHL7uDUvUk3c3IoLgp-Ub4iNPrpxe8JGjXBl1ntarRIy1Izu5FByy8OFzOOQr8gQA5OCnnvaG_p20IOPQQmaDpHX2LyLJ6IRI0laPFlIs-Ez0O" alt="git history added files and deleted files"><figcaption>git contributions graph</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency"><em>https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency</em></a><em> </em><br></p><blockquote>Comment: The contributions graph that you see above from HashiCorp Vault repository is a typical view of a project's history. The regularity you find in project contribution graphs is both surprising and interesting (check out some projects graphs, it seems to be a rule of nature). <br></blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="3"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="real-world-examples-recent-data-breaches">Real world examples: recent data breaches</h2><p>Secrets being leaked into public places happens with surprising regularity.</p><p>If you perform a search on GitHub for the commit message <em>‘removed aws key’</em>, you will find thousands of results. And that's just within public repositories.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5WbkGwTV2zn3HJ-qtHQu8nJFOkjyd5zSdh2CRAemcZLaxw7N7KILSMhpjmdCKyxpwAjVokYUWKooWKJ4CYdK3_GmAgieNFx-5I7qDTXUcNCTsfwemi9Qum9-4qkKd5IV0bqEhqkZ" alt="Removed AWS keys search on GitHub"><figcaption>GitHub commit remove credential</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/search?q=removed+aws+key&amp;type=Commits">https://github.com/search?q=removed+aws+key&amp;type=Commits</a></p><p>GitGuardian detects over 3,000 leaked secrets each day within public GitHub alone, there are thousands of examples for this but below are a couple recent or noteworthy examples.</p><p><em>Publicly disclosed examples of recent data breaches through leaked credentials.</em></p><blockquote><strong>Starbucks Data Breach - January 2020 </strong><br><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/716292">JumpCloud API key found in GitHub repository</a></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Equifax Data Breach - April 2020</strong><br><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/694931">leaked secrets in personal GitHub account granted access to sensitive data for equifax customers</a></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Uber Data Breach - October 2016</strong><br><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/federal_register_notices/2018/04/152_3054_uber_revised_consent_analysis_pub_frn.pdf">Poor password hygiene allowed intruders to access Uber’s Amazon S3 Datastore using an AWS access key posted in a private GitHub repository.</a></blockquote><p>If this seems like an issue for only large companies to worry about, it’s not. Attackers are constantly exploiting personal services through secret keys too. In one example, <strong>bad actors scanned GitHub for AWS keys and used them to mine cryptocurrency, leaving <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots/">developers with thousands of dollars in debt</a></strong>.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[RESEARCH IN PROGRESS] We "forgot" to hide AWS keys in the code of a public repo on <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a> .

</figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="4"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="detecting-secrets-in-reviews-or-not-">Detecting secrets in reviews (or not)</h2><p>One great advantage of git is to be able to quickly and clearly see changes made and compare previous and proposed code states. It’s therefore common to believe that if secrets are leaked in source code, they of course will be detected within a code review or in a pull request.</p><blockquote>Code reviews are great for detecting logic flaws, maintaining good coding practices and keeping code quality high. But they are not adequate protection for detecting secrets. </blockquote><p>This is because reviews generally only consider the net difference between the current and proposed state. Not the entire history of a branch. Branches are commonly cleaned before being merged into the master branch, temporary code is added then deleted, unnecessary files added then removed.. But now these files, which are high risk candidates for containing secrets, are not visible to the reviewer (unless they want to go through the entire history of a branch). <br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XZOq-SU3EwpmQM6YEo52h7jk1vUM99PL-IJSs5wbRfioPpiAqIl8Ss2zm6MhZPWGLQ8bv_52YMcMB-qPGhb98e0b52cYMNJQYJB8-FXTE1URxxa9g5_2gpwmqT2iqySjDYXhrfCe" alt="Looking for secrets in git history"><figcaption>Git code review diagram</figcaption></figure><p>Let's walk through the example above. While this is over simplified it tells a familiar story. </p><p><br>Commit B a file named main.py is added. A new branch is created to add a new function to main.py in commit C, this feature uses an API key so to save time for testing this is hardcoded. Once the feature is working the hardcoded API key is replaced with an env variable and the file is cleaned. Finally a pull request is made and accepted because the reviewer looks at the net difference between commit B and D, ignoring commit C. Now undetected secrets are buried in the git history of the project.</p><p>While this scenario is very basic, add in hundreds of commits and files between master and a development branch and you can see how easy it is to miss secrets in code reviews. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow.

</figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="5"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="using-automated-detection-to-find-secrets-in-git">Using automated detection to find secrets in git</h2><p>Taking in consideration all we have just discussed about secrets inside git, it is clear that this is a problem that will persist and one we cannot solve with human code reviews. While automation is not always the answer, detecting secrets, in particular secrets inside git, automated secrets detection is a clear solution to this widespread problem. </p><p>Unfortunately detecting secrets in git is not quite as easy as it first seems because of the probabilistic nature of secrets. This makes it hard to distinguish between a true secret and other random-looking strings like database IDs or other hashes.</p><p>The good news however, is that <a href="https://dashboard.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian</a> has built powerful tools for developers to detect secrets in git. A great dashboard with native GitHub and GitLab integrations, a CLI tool called <a href="https://github.com/GitGuardian/gg-shield">GG-Shield</a> or you can even build custom your own git secrets scanner using the <a href="https://api.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian API</a>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2><p>Let’s have a quick review of what we have gone through. Git repositories are very common places to find secrets and they remain the perfect incubator for secrets to sprawl into multiple locations. Git keeps a track of a project's history which can be deep making finding secrets difficult. Because of the workflow git creates, it is common for any secrets to be missed during manual checking procedures and automated secrets detection should be introduced into the SDLC.</p><p>Curious of how secrets detection works? Next episode in the secrets in source code series we are going to dive into the mechanics of secrets detection including why probabilistic algorithms are so tricky and the secret sauce behind making them work.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->

<hr>
<p>When linking to a page for the <strong>purpose of reference</strong>, it seems better to me to <em><strong>link to the <a href="https://archive.org/">archive</a> of a given page</strong></em>, rather than to the original site itself.</p>
<p>This ensures that after some years have gone by, <strong>my article is guaranteed to be consistent</strong>. Due the  changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:</p>
<ul>
<li>404 /  Not Found (most common)</li>
<li>Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content</li>
<li>Content that, due to a rise in popularity, is now shielded, demanding the user to make an account to read the entire article.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>Take defensive measures. To future-proof your content, rather than reference the general web, its far more reliable to link to an archive.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example:</h2>
<p>The Epoch Times wrote an article on Smartphones data-mining their users. This is the archived article here:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214015500/https://www.theepochtimes.com/smartphone-app-users-are-data-mined-even-when-not-using-the-apps_2787202.html">The Archive Version (fully readable)</a></p>
<h3 id="article-content-before">Article Content Before</h3>
<p>You can see its perfectly “normal” readable useful  content.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-before.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<h3 id="article-content-after">Article Content After</h3>
<p>Now it’s spam from a site suffering financial need.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-after.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<p>So in Feb 14 2019 your users would have seen the content you intended. However in Sep 07 2020, your users are being asked to support independent Journalism instead.</p>
<h2 id="if-an-archive-record-doesnt-exist-make-one">If an Archive Record Doesn't Exist, Make One</h2>
<p>Its worth the extra moment, in referencing a site, to make an archive of the page you wish to reference, if one does not exist. After that, immediately use the link from the archive.org entry, rather than the blog, news, info, or forum site you wish to refer to.</p>
<h2 id="in-unstable-times-take-measures-for-stability">In Unstable Times, Take Measures for Stability</h2>
<p>The web is a fast changing place. Even more during the Covid pandemic and suffering financial markets. Since times are financially harder, websites are disappearing, heaping up advertising, demanding user response, and things like this.</p>
<p>To avoid your content losing quality due to these things, linking to a solid, unchanging static copy of the page is far more reliable.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>URL query parameters and how laxness creates de facto requirements on the web</h2>

	<p><small>September  7, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the ways that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> (the code behind <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>) is unusual is that it strictly validates the query parameters
it receives on URLs, including on HTTP <code>GET</code> requests for ordinary
pages. If a HTTP request has unexpected and unsupported query
parameters, such a <code>GET</code> request will normally fail. When I made
this decision it seemed the cautious and conservative approach, but
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CautionIsAMistakeToday">this caution has turned out to be a mistake on the modern web</a>. In practice, all sorts of sites will
generate versions of your URLs with all sorts of extra query
parameters tacked on, give them to people, and expect them to work.
If your website refuses to play along, (some) people won't get to
see your content. <strong>On today's web, you need to accept (and then
ignore) arbitrary query parameters on your URLs</strong>.</p>

<p>(Today's new query parameter is 's=NN', for various values of NN
like '04' and '09'. I'm not sure what's generating these URLs, but
it may be Slack.)</p>

<p>You might wonder how we got here, and that is a story of lax behavior
(or, if you prefer, being liberal in what you accept). In the
beginning, both Apache (for static web pages) and early web
applications often ignored extra query parameters on URLs, at least
on <code>GET</code> requests. I suspect that other early web servers also
imitated Apache here, but I have less exposure to their behavior
than Apache's. My guess is that this behavior wasn't deliberate,
it was just the simplest way to implement both Apache and early
web applications; you paid attention to what you cared about and
didn't bother to explicitly check that nothing else was supplied.</p>

<p>When people noticed that this behavior was commonplace and widespread,
they began using it. I believe that one of the early uses was for
embedding 'where this link was shared' information for your own web
analytics (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AnalyticsVsSecurity">cf</a>), either based on your logs
or using JavaScript embedded in the page. In the way of things,
once this was common enough other people began helpfully tagging
the links that were shared through them for you, which is why I
began to see various 'utm_*' query parameters on inbound
requests to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> even though I never
published such URLs.
Web developers don't leave attractive nuisances alone for long, so
soon enough people were sticking on extra query parameters to your
URLs that were mostly for them and not so much for you. Facebook
may have been one of the early pioneers here with their 'fbclid'
parameter, but other websites have hopped on this particular train
since then (as I saw recently with these 's=NN' parameters).</p>

<p>At this point, the practice of other websites and services adding
random query parameters to your URLs that pass through them is so
wide spread and common that accepting random query parameters is
pretty much a practical requirement for any web content serving
software that wants to see wide use and not be irritating to the
people operating it. If, like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a>, you stick to your guns and
refuse to accept some or all of them, you will drop some amount of
your incoming requests from real people, disappointing would be
readers.</p>

<p>This practical requirement for URL handling is not documented in
any specification, and it's probably not in most 'best practices'
documentation. People writing new web serving systems that are
tempted to be strict and safe and cautious get to learn about it
the hard way.</p>

<p>In general, any laxness in actual implementations of a system can
create a similar spiral of de facto requirements. Something that
is permitted and is useful to people will be used, and then supporting
that becomes a requirement. This is especially the case in a
distributed system like the web, where any attempt to tighten the
rules would only be initially supported by a minority of websites.
These websites would be 'outvoted' by the vast majority of websites
that allow the lax behavior and support it, because that's what
happens when the vast majority work and the minority don't.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>On Seamus Heaney</em>, by RF Foster, Princeton University Press (Writers on Writers series), 228 pp, £14.99, ISBN: 978-0691174372</p> <p>Karl Miller always disclaimed credit for being the first person – first in the UK anyway – to spot the merit in Seamus Heaney’s early work. Others had got there before him, he said. But, in 1964, and in defiance of opposition from colleagues at the <em>New Statesman</em>, where he was literary editor, Miller published three Heaney poems, including “Death of a Naturalist” and “Digging”. The poems were subsequently read and admired by Charles Monteith of Faber (coincidentally, a fellow Ulsterman), who wrote to Heaney inviting him to submit a manuscript. <em>Death of a Naturalist</em> duly appeared, and hindsight shows its publication to be a momentous event in literary history. From this point on, you might say, Heaney never looked back.</p> <p>But of course looking back was precisely what had brought him into the limelight, and looking back remained central to his literary impetus. However, as time went on, the process was negotiated with increasing virtuosity, density, and transformative power. “Remember everything and keep your head.” This line, attributed to the ghost of William Carleton in Section Two of the “Station Island” sequence, is advice the poet always abided by, with his new-minted “themes of locality and memory” and his rural minutiae, down to the ox-eye daisies and dandelions in the middle of the road to school, or the milk poured for cats in a rank puddle-place in a stone kitchen floor. The “scraggy farm and moss” aspect of Heaney’s Co Derry childhood is recreated with an intensity and assurance as far removed as possible from the picturesque or facile associations of country – and in particular, Northern Irish country – verse. If “bogs, bulls and buckets” persist in the Heaney lexicon (as one faintly sarcastic reviewer of <em>Wintering Out</em> had it), they are tied up with the observer’s complex motivations and visionary brevity of style.</p> <p>Indeed there was nothing about Seamus Heaney’s early life, or his wonderfully throughother boyhood environment, to indicate the route his astonishing career would follow. “By the 1990s,” writes RF Foster in his astute new study, Heaney’s “work and reputation were positioned at the centre of the English canon, while operating emphatically from a base in Ireland (North and South).” How Heaney arrived at this position is a story of steady progress, of an unparalleled gift for illumination and evocation, of a way of being orthodox and utterly independent at the same time. (“At once complete insider and odd man out” in Paul Muldoon’s words.) The independence in is the output, the orthodoxy in the list of honours, awards and academic posts which piled up over the years and culminated in the Nobel laureateship in 1995. It should be said that nothing about his immense celebrity went to the poet’s head: he remained calm and down-to-earth in the midst of all the brouhaha and kept a steadfast demeanour – though at what cost to his psychological wellbeing one can only surmise.</p> <p>It was not, of course, a matter of uninterrupted acclaim. There were stumbling blocks as well as stepping stones along the way, and some of these had a distinctly local character. It was felt in some Northern Irish circles – and especially while his career was taking off – that Heaney needed constant reminding not to get above himself. If he’d been singled out – well, it was a lucky chance: others existed who were equally deserving of fame. There were subtle, and not-so-subtle, put-downs. Even his future friend and admirer Brian Friel, Foster notes, took a somewhat acerbic line about Heaney’s “easy manipulation [at the time] of a new audience in England”. But Foster’s most searing criticism is directed at the poet and founder of <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em> James Simmons, whom he accuses of harbouring a “festering jealousy” and of being “lazily obtuse” in his assessments of the Heaney <em>oeuvre</em>. Foster really does not like Simmons, and nor is the <em>HU</em>’s brand of bare-faced irreverence greatly to his taste.</p> <p>He has a point – though perhaps he misses Simmons’s occasional elan and fluency in his own poetry – and he is right to draw attention to the various misreadings, including Simmons’s, of Heaney’s pivotal collection <em>North</em> (his fourth). Hailed internationally as “a vital achievement” and enshrining its author as “the best Irish poet since W.B. Yeats” (Robert Lowell’s phrase), the book encountered a certain disparagement, not to say outright hostility, in Heaney’s home territory. Some of this had a political dimension. On the strength of one or two poems (in particular the desolating and striking “Punishment”), some Irish critics chose to attribute to him an excessive solidarity with the Catholic North and republican grievances (just to even things out, he was later taken to task for eschewing a supportive role in relation to republicanism). In fact, of course, Heaney is far from condoning violence or dissociating himself from any of his inherited allegiances. He did, as a poet, want to stand apart from both sides, he said, while acknowledging the inescapable, and inspirational, circumstances of his early life and times. Terence Brown, reviewing <em>Stepping Stones</em> in 2008 (the remarkable series of questions posed by Dennis O’Driscoll and answered comprehensively by Heaney), sums up the ways in which poetry – any poetry ‑ is a product of “life situations … cultural contexts … intellectual preoccupations and involvement with public issues”. </p> <p>Cultural contexts and public issues. These, during Heaney’s lifetime, were emphatically bound up with the thirty-year conflict known as the Troubles; and part of the poet’s driving force involved a quest – as he famously put it – “for images and symbols adequate to our predicament” (echoing Yeats’s “befitting emblems of adversity”). Not obvious images and symbols, indeed, but those which would carry the utmost resonance and work their effect at different levels. Some he found in an enlarged idea of “Northernness”, taking in iron-age excavations and a pared-down Viking connection. When he was questioned by O’Driscoll, many years later, Heaney stood by the poems in <em>North</em>, which he judged to be appropriately “odd and hard and contrary”.</p> <p>It wasn’t only in Irish literary circles that the odd swipe was directed at Heaney and his poetry. Among prominent anti-Heaneyites Foster names Ian Hamilton of <em>The New Review</em>, for example, along with A Alvarez, who scrutinised <em>Field Work</em> for “verbal affectations” (he found a few), and blamed the poet for cultivating an overdone “charm and rhetoric”. And he didn’t stop there, going on to mock Heaney’s “fine way with the language” – a phrase suggesting a showiness and slickness of which the poet was incapable. Actually, the Alvarez appraisal (in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>), and others in the same mode, suggest nothing more than a wilful declaration of independence from the laudatory chorus. Some critics were exasperated by what they considered the undue elevation of Heaney – the “Heaney Phenomenon”, as they dubbed it, investing the phrase with a sardonic intonation.</p> <p>This is what Foster is referring to when he mentions “the half-suppressed current of begrudging comment”. But the expression of misgivings died away as Heaney’s place in the canon of contemporary literature became unassailable. Those who had spotted something strong and original and compelling in his work from the start – who had simply noticed “how good Heaney’s poems were” (Karl Miller) – could congratulate themselves on their discernment. For Michael Longley – for example – reviewing <em>Death of a Naturalist</em> in 1966, Heaney’s childhood landscapes had already acquired “the validity of myth”, while the collection as a whole announced the inauguration of “a true poet of considerable importance”. Heaney was not the only one, of course: there was Longley himself, and Derek Mahon; and, in the eyes of the poetry-reading public, the three newcomers on the scene were soon to coalesce into a poetic triumvirate, before its separate components went their separate, and superlative, ways. Things, in the cultural sphere, were astir in mid-1960s Belfast, after the doldrums of the previous decade; and the Heaney household, up until 1972, was a particular centre of ebullience and expansiveness.</p> <p><em>On Seamus Heaney</em> treats the poet’s life and work with thoroughness and dispassion. The story of what happened to Heaney is deftly retold by RF Foster, and retold in a way that makes sense of the poet’s prodigious journey, from Bellaghy to Belfast to Berkeley, and onwards and upwards thereafter to a kind of poetic apotheosis. The year Heaney spent (with his family) as a visiting professor at Berkeley in California was crucial to his development in all sorts of ways – “Something changed, all right,” he told Dennis O’Driscoll – and it’s likely that the experience deepened his dissatisfaction with goings-on in Belfast, once he had returned to the city. At any rate, within a year or so, Heaney had taken himself, with his wife and children, out of the North and into a cottage in Co Wicklow. The cottage at Glanmore was rented from the Canadian academic and Synge scholar Anne Saddlemyer, and – although the Heaneys bought it later – it represented a staging post on the way to Dublin, eventual international renown, and endless demands on the poet’s time and stamina.</p> <p>There were many distractions – but through it all, the poetry continued to work its spellbinding effect. It is wonderfully idiosyncratic in its rhythms and allusions and cross-currents. We have the celebrated sequences, the Bog Poems, the Glanmore Sonnets, the Station Island encounters with significant revenants. And the farm at Mossbawn in Co Derry, the childhood abundant in grace and exhilaration and plentiful food for thought, the sectarian dimension and neighbourly accommodations worked out expediently, the ultimate wreckage of the North, with – for the poet – …</p></div></div>

              <article>
                  

<p>Each year, I try to set a few personal goals that stretch me in some way.</p>

<p>In 2017, for example, I <a href="https://forrestbrazeal.com/2017/12/03/how-to-read-100-books-in-a-year-and-still-have-a-life/">read one hundred books</a>, which turned out to be more a test of endurance than skill.</p>

<p>This year, I decided to see if I could write a fictional short story and get it published somewhere. Though I do a fair amount of technical writing in the course of my work, I’d never seriously attempted to write and sell a short story before, or even taken a creative writing class.</p>

<p>This meant I had no knowledge of the market, no connections, and generally no idea what I was doing.</p>

<p>So, a challenge!</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>I decided to focus on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction">speculative fiction genre</a>, partly because it seemed more accessible and mostly because unlike literary journals, the best speculative fiction magazines still pay their authors.</p>

<p>My goals, in descending order of likelihood, were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get something published somewhere, even if unpaid</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published and get paid something for it, even a token amount</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published at <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#short">Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) professional rates</a> (currently 6 cents a word)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least 1000 words published at SFWA-qualifying markets (the standard for <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#associate">SFWA associate member status</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least three stories published, totaling more than 10,000 words, at SFWA-qualifying professional markets (<a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#active">SFWA Active Member status</a>, my self-imposed standard for a legit “professional” science fiction writer)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="results-through-nov-8">Results (through Nov. 8)</h2>

<p>After many form rejections on several terrible stories, I sold my <a href="https://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/biotech/forrest-brazeal/memory-foam">first story</a> on March 23rd, 2018, to Daily Science Fiction (an SWFA pro market). At 1010 words, this sale actually crossed the first four goals off my list at once.</p>

<p>However, I continued to write and improve over the spring and summer of 2018, selling several more stories along the way, eventually totaling more than 16,000 words of fiction. Some publications have long wait times, but by the time “Empathy Bee” <a href="http://www.diabolicalplots.com/the-diabolical-plots-year-five-fiction-lineup/">is published</a> in March 2019, I should have the wordcount needed for active SFWA membership status, my most insane stretch goal.</p>

<h3 id="by-the-numbers">By the numbers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Stories Written: 22</p></li>

<li><p>Total Wordcount: ~60,000, the length of a medium-sized novel</p></li>

<li><p>Total Submissions: 70</p></li>

<li><p>Stories Sold: 8</p></li>

<li><p>SFWA-qualifying professional sales: 6</p></li>

<li><p>Rejections: 50 (15 personal)</p></li>

<li><p>Withdrawals: 2</p></li>

<li><p>Still Pending: 10</p></li>

<li><p>Other Results: <a href="https://www.writersofthefuture.com/writers-of-the-future-3rd-quarter-standings-for-year-35/">Honorable Mention, Writers of the Future</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>

<h3 id="have-no-ego">Have no ego</h3>

<p>It turns out writing short stories that sell is really, really hard. It’s hard to think of good ideas, it’s hard to write them down in a form that anyone would want to read, and it’s even harder when those readers are magazine editors who get literally hundreds of unsolicited submissions every month. Don’t attempt it if you have an easily bruised sense of self-worth, or you will be depressed a lot.</p>

<p>I’m grateful to have sold some stories this year, but my identity is not tied up in “being a writer”. It can’t be, because I have to…</p>

<h3 id="embrace-failure">Embrace failure</h3>

<p>I learned to view rejections as a badge of honor, which is a helpful mental trick to keep from going insane after a few dozen forms. As I told Jason Bougger in an <a href="http://www.themeofabsence.com/2018/11/author-interview-forrest-brazeal/">author interview</a> over at Theme of Absence, rejections are like the good soreness you feel after working out – it means you’re growing.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-feedback-loop-short">Keep your feedback loop short</h3>

<p>Early on, when I was getting form rejections from big magazines with no accompanying feedback, I got really frustrated because I knew my work was obviously not up to par – I just didn’t know why. A submission to a smaller publication, Abyss and Apex (who I later ended up selling a different story to!) brought back a personalized rejection with a helpful piece of advice: try signing up for the <a href="https://sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com/">Online Writing Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>At the time I had never heard of writers’ workshops and didn’t really understand why they would be helpful. But I paid a few dollars and signed up. The other writers there provided generous feedback on how to improve my work, and I learned just as much from critiquing their pieces. The OWW membership more than paid for itself when several readers pointed out an obvious plot hole in my story “Empathy Bee”, which subsequently sold in revised form to Diabolical Plots.</p>

<p>Later, once I had professional credits, I was able to join the wonderful <a href="http://www.codexwriters.com/">Codex</a> writers’ community, which has hugely expanded my horizons and understanding of the industry. The more I write, the less I trust myself to be a good judge of my work’s quality, and the more I seek out and appreciate feedback from others.</p>

<h3 id="write-smart-not-just-hard">Write smart, not just hard</h3>

<p>Some writers recommend keeping insane writing regimens, cranking out thousands of words a day, saying it’s the only way to improve. And I wrote a fair amount this year. But stepping back and getting feedback on my work was just as important.</p>

<p>I had a music teacher who used to ask: “Did you practice ten hours, or just the same hour ten times?” When I took time to evaluate my work and deliberately build on it, I improved faster than just by vomiting words indiscriminately onto the page.</p>

<h3 id="keep-reading-good-prose">Keep reading good prose</h3>

<p>No, I didn’t read a hundred books again this year. But I did try to keep my ear filled with good prose. For example, this summer I got on a southern realist kick: Flannery O’Connor, Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers. Studying how those writers crafted characters and situations helped me nail down a couple of southern-set stories that ended up selling. My science fiction writing improved more from reading good writers, period, than from reading science fiction.</p>

<h3 id="just-because-you-wrote-something-good-enough-to-get-published-somewhere-that-doesn-t-mean-the-next-thing-you-write-won-t-be-terrible">Just because you wrote something good enough to get published somewhere, that doesn’t mean the next thing you write won’t be terrible</h3>

<p>This sounds stupid in hindsight, but for a long time I had it in my head that once I sold a story, I’d have figured out what it took to get published, and I wouldn’t have any trouble after that. Instead, I still get tons of rejections, and often my writing seems just as lifeless and terrible to me as it did before I sold my first story.</p>

<p>The good news is that with practice, the overall trend appears to be upward. At least, when I look back at my work from the beginning of the year, I can’t believe how bad it is. So I must be improving, right?</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Like many people who start out in the short fiction game, I would love to publish a novel. So I think that might be a 2019 goal. But I’m sure I’ll continue to write short stories, too. There’s real satisfaction in creating something that you can hold in your head all at once, knowing how it will turn out and why it’s effective.</p>

I'm your host Lukas Biewald. Jeremy Howard created the Fast.ai course, which is maybe the most popular course to learn machine learning and there are a lot out there. He's also the author of the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fast.ai and PyTorch and in that process, he made the Fast.ai library which lots of people use independently to write deep learning. Before that, he was the CEO and co-founder of Enlitic, an exciting startup that applies deep learning to health care applications. And before that, he was the president of Kaggle, one of the most exciting earliest machine learning companies. I'm super excited to talk to him. So Jeremy, it's nice to talk to you. And in preparing the questions, I realized that every time I've talked to you there have been a few gems that I've remembered that I would never think to ask about. Like one time you told me about how you learned Chinese and another time you gave me Dad parenting advice, very specific advice and it's been actually super helpful. </p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh great. Tell me what Dad parenting advice worked out?</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Well, what you told me was when you change diapers, use a blow dryer to change a really frustrating experience to a really joyful experience and it's like such good advice. I don't know how you.. I guess I can imagine how you thought of it, but it's...</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, yeah, I know they love the whooshing sound, they love the warmth. I'm kind of obsessed about Dad things. So I'm always happy to talk about Dad things. That is this podcast.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Can we start with that? Now that my daughter is eight months old. Do you have any suggestions for her?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh my goodness! Eight months old. You know, it's like the same with any kind of learning. It's all about consistency. So I think that the main thing we did right with Claire was just, you know, this delightful child now is we were just super consistent. Like if we said you can't have X unless you do Y, we would never give her X if she didn't do Y. If you want to take your scooter down to the bottom of the road, you have to carry it back up again. We read this great book that was saying if you're not consistent, it becomes like this thing, it's like a gambler. It's like sometimes you get the thing you want, so you just have to keep trying so that's my number one piece of advice. It's the same with teaching machine learning. We always tell people that tenacity is the most important thing for students. To stick with it, do it every day.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I guess just in the spirit of questions, I'm genuinely curious about, you know, you've built this amazing framework and teaching thing that I think is maybe the most popular and most appreciated framework. I was wondering if you could start by telling me the story of what inspired you to do that and what was the journey to making Fast.ai, the curriculum and Fast.ai, the ML framework.</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>So it was something that my wife Rachel and I started together. Rachel has a math PhD, super technical background, early data scientist and engineer, Uber. I don't. I have just scraped by a philosophy undergrad and have no technical background. But from both of our different directions, we both had this frustration that neural networks in 2012 were super important, clearly going to change the world, but super inaccessible and so we would go to meetups and try to figure out like how do we... Like I knew the basic idea, I'd coded neural networks 20 years ago, but how do you make them really good? There wasn't any open source software at the time for running on GPUs. You know, Dan Seresen's thing was available, but you had to pay for it. There was no source code and we just thought, oh, we've got to change this, because the history of technology leaps has been that it generally increases inequality because the people with resources can access the new technology and then that leads to societal upheaval and a lot of unhappiness. So we thought, well, we should just do what we can. So we thought how are we going to fix this? Basically the goal was, and still is, to be able to use deep learning without requiring any code so that, you know, because the vast majority of the world can't code, we kind of thought, well, to get there, we should, first of all, see what exists right now? Learn how to use it as best as we can ourselves, teach people how to best use it as we can and then make it better, which requires doing research and then turning that into software and then changing the course to teach the hopefully slightly easier version and repeat that again and again for a few years. And so we're kind of in that process.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>That's so interesting. Do you worry that the stuff you're teaching, you're sort of trying to make it obsolete, right? Because you're trying to build higher level abstractions? Like I think one of the things that people really appreciate your course is that it's really clear, in-depth explanations of how these things work. Do you think that that's eventually going to be not necessary or how do you think about that?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, to some extent. I mean, so if you look at the new book and the new course, chapter one starts with really, really foundational stuff around what is a machine learning algorithm? What do we mean to learn an algorithm? What's the difference between traditional programming and machine learning to solve the same problem? And those kinds of basic foundations I think will always be useful, even at the point you're not using any code. I feel like even right now, if somebody is using like PlatformAI or some kind of code-free framework, you still need to understand these basics of an algorithm can only learn based on the data you provide. It's generally not going to be able to extrapolate to patterns it's not seen yet, stuff like that. Um, but yeah, I mean, we have so far released two new courses every year, you know, a part one and part two every year because every year, it's totally out of date. And we always say to our students at the start of part one, Look, you know, none of the details you're learning are going to be of any use in a year or two's time. There's a time when we're doing Piano and then TensorFlow and Keras, and then playing PyTorch. We always say, look, don't worry too much about the software we're using because none of it's still any good, you know, it's goal changing rapidly, you know, faster than JavaScript frameworks, but the concepts are important and yeah, you can pick up a new library and I don't know by weekend, I …</p></div></div>
