			<h2>–ise or –ize?</h2>
			

                    <p>There is nothing like a good rant!&nbsp; It may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">improve </span>the world, and it may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">fix the issue that initiated the </span>rant, but it feels so <em>good </em>afterwards.</p>

                    <p>This rant is about the suggestion that the use of a
                    ‘z’ in words like nationalization is somehow
                    wrong, or American. It must be admitted that there are
                    words with a ‘z’ in them that are purely
                    American, like advertize, or maybe just wrong, like
                    surmize. Sometimes it is simply error — a word whose
                    spelling is not known, and whose correct spelling is not
                    sought, is arbitrarily given a ‘z’ in the
                    honest but mistaken belief it is correct. Sometimes words
                    with a z-form in American represent an older (perhaps
                    Elizabethan) form of English that made its way to the USA
                    before the language was standardized in England. More
                    likely, the American ‘z’ is one of Noah
                    Webster’s attempts to ‘standardize’ or
                    ‘improve’ American usage of English when he
                    produced his famous dictionary in 1828, in which his
                    decision to make deliberate and extensive revisions of
                    spelling was implemented — he has been described as a great
                    spelling reformer (I also had a go at reforming spelling
                    when I was at school but it wasn’t appreciated).
                    Webster evidently decided to use a ‘z’ wherever
                    he considered the pronunciation called for it. This was a 
					highly unusual example of a dictionary leading the written 
					language rather than attempting to reflect it.</p>

                    <p>This polemic is nothing to do with the Americans. If we
                    overlook the various words that the Americans deliberately
                    choose to spell differently, the majority of words that take a
                    ‘z’, or an ‘s’ that is pronounced
                    like a ‘z’, seem to fall very clearly into
                    those that must take an ‘s’ (like
                    <em>compromise</em>, where the derivation is
                    –misser), those that must take a ‘z’,
                    (like <em>prize</em>), and the rest, about which
                    controversy apparently rages (if only here).</p>

                    <p>I have been to a great deal of trouble to look into
                    this, looking not only at various text books and style manuals,
                    but also at a range of literature over the years to see
                    which spelling was preferred. I refer only to cases of the 
					third type given above where writers <span lang="en-gb">or 
					their publishers </span>have come to regard the 
					use of 's' as an acceptable alternative to the 'z' (we are 
					all agreed that misuse of the two other types would be an 
					error).</p>

                    <p>It seems to me that in books printed in England the use
                    of the ‘z’ overwhelmingly predominated until
                    the Second World War, though on a far smaller scale the
                    ‘s’ can be found used by some printing houses,
                    even in Victorian times. Textbooks set out the correctness
                    of using ‘z’, some of them setting out in
                    considerable detail the rationale for use of
                    ‘s’ or ‘z’ depending on origin.
                    After the Second World War the ‘s’ alternative
                    is more frequently offered as a possibility and some house
                    style manuals (though not Oxford’s) indicate a
                    preference for ‘s’ — not because of any
                    suggestion that ‘z’ is wrong, mark you, but
                    because ‘s’ had come to be tolerated and it avoided
                    having to remember which usage is which. Recent manuals and
                    dictionaries seem to have given up on the prescriptive use
                    of a ‘z’, though it is usually offered as an
                    alternative where correct.</p>

                    <p>It seems to me, summarizing, and using a ‘z’
                    correctly and non-Americanly, that:</p>
					

                    <p>For myself, I am very happy to keep using a
                    ‘z’ where it is appropriate, and I do try hard
                    to get it right but must admit to being inconsistent
                    sometimes. <span lang="en-gb">Using the ‘z’ form</span>, of course, invites people to pick me up on
                    it, whence I refer them to the Oxford English Dictionary
                    (the big one) and that generally ends the matter. On the 
					whole it is not a book to pick a fight with.</p>

                    <p>I suppose even after being presented with the facts
                    there will be people who will persist with the
                    ‘s’ option, and that’s up to them —
                    nothing more I can do. All I ask is that people determined
                    to use the ‘s’ do not regard those using the
                    ‘z’ as using Americanisms!!!</p>

                    <p>Many of the great publishing houses are happy with ‘
                    <em>-ize</em>’ etc endings, and large, influential
                    organizations such as London Transport invariably used the
                    ‘- <em>ize’ </em>form in posters and other public
                    communications, though their modern PC-originated material
                    leaves much to be desired.</p>

                    <p>I attach below <span lang="en-gb">(actually it is in the 
					next column) </span>various references that shed more light
                    on the matter. Note that some house style guidance which
                    has opted for the '- <em>ise</em>' form refers to
                    alleged controversy about the more correct spelling about
                    which 'the authorities differ'. House style guides
                    are not authorities of themselves, although they may rely
                    on them and refer to them. Of the ‘authorities’ I
                    have sought, they all indicate '- <em>ize</em>' as
                    etymologically correct and I have not yet found any
                    'authority' that explains how '-
                    <em>ise</em>' can be correct; if any reader knows of
                    one I'd be glad to hear of it and will be happy to
                    quote it below.</p>

                    <p>And do I feel better? Well as a matter of fact, I rather
                    think I do.</p>

                    <p>THE <em>-ize, not -ise,</em> ending
                    should be used where both spellings are in use. Generally,
                    <em>-ize</em> is a suffix applied to the stems of nouns
                    ending in <em>-ism, -ization, -izer,</em> -y, or to the
                    complete noun.</p>

                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <br>
                    agony − agonize
                    <br>
                    civilization − civilize
                    <br>
                    appetizer − appetize
                    <br>
                    criticism − criticize
                    <br>
                    canal&nbsp;− canalize
                    <br>
                    transistor&nbsp;− transistorize</p>

                    <p>The ending -ise is correct when the
                    noun has <em>–is ­</em>as part of the stem, e.g.
                    in the syllables <em>-vis­</em> (seeing), -cis-
                    (cutting), <em>-mis-</em> (putting), and is also used for
                    those nouns which do not terminate in <em>-ism,
                    -ization,</em> etc. Exceptions are
                    aggrandize­ment/aggrandize, recognition/recognize, and
                    others noted in <em>C.O.D.</em> as `assimilated to verbs in
                    -ize'. Reference should be made to <em>C.O.D.</em> and
                    Collins, <em>Authors' and Printers'
                    Dictionary,</em> if there is any doubt. Some of the more
                    common <em>-ise</em> words <em>follow:</em></p>

<![CDATA[Overriding C++ virtual functions at run time]]>

August 9, 2020 | https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-orge37fcf2">
<p> The C++ standard does not specify how virtual functions should be implemented. In practice, however, compilers generate a virtual function table and place a pointer to it as the first member of a class. Multiple inheritance complicates things, but let’s not jump into that rabbit hole for now. Instead, consider the following C++ class: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>class</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>virtual</span> ~<span>A</span>();
  <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>);
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Since the structure of the virtual function table is not standardized, compilers may use different layouts. The layout used by the GCC compiler is this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>A_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>; <span>// </span><span>Pointer to type information</span>
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>A</span>*); <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);    <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Virtual function pointers are laid out in declaration order. The <code>A_vtable</code> structure reveals another C++ secret: member functions are just obfuscated versions of normal functions that get <code>this</code> as the first argument. That’s it. If you know Python, D or Nim, this won’t surprise you a bit. </p>
<p> The fact that C++ has a dedicated syntax for member functions leads to numerous problems which I’m not going to detail here. Fixes have been proposed since at least 2004, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/705855444049399808">to no avail</a>. The <code>std::function</code> class however had to do it the right way, so we ended up with a language that has one syntax as a language feature and another as a standard library feature. </p>
<p> OK, enough whining. Back to our original track. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler actually generates</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A_func</span>(<span>A</span>* <span>this</span>, <span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p> Generated member function names are actually much more complicated due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C++">name mangling</a>. </p>
<p> There is one virtual table that is shared by all instances of <code>class A</code>, and the compiler will statically initialize it for you by placing the addresses of <code>A</code>‘s member functions and the generated type info into it. About like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>const</span> <span>A_vtable</span> <span>A_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;A_type_info,  <span>// </span><span>We'll skip this now</span>
  &amp;A_destructor, <span>// </span><span>Pointer to an ordinary function</span>
  &amp;A_func        <span>// </span><span>Ditto</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Now, whenever you create an instance of <code>class A</code>, you actually instantiate a structure like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>class_A</span>
{
  <span>A_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> The compiler will initialize the <code>vtable</code> pointer for you. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>A</span> <span>a</span>;

<span>// </span><span>What actually happens</span>
<span>class_A</span> <span>a</span>;
a.vtable = &amp;A_vtable_instance;
</pre>
</div>
<p> If you derive <code>B</code> from <code>A</code>, this is what happens (conceptually): </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>class</span> <span>B</span> : <span>public</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>override</span>;
  <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>func2</span>() <span>const</span>; <span>// </span><span>A new virtual function</span>
};

<span>int</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) {}

<span>void</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func2</span>() <span>const</span> {}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler generates</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>B_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>For a long time, business software was clunky. Consumer software continued to radically innovate on user experience, staying ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Palm to iPhone. Styluses to capacitive touch. Taxis to Ubers. Torrents to Netflix. MP3s to Spotify, etc. We’ve lived through this story of how innovation in consumer software radically improved our lives in the last decade.</p>
<p>At one point, business software had no choice but to stop being clunky and terrible to use, because nobody wanted to walk into work to use shitty software. And as teams got more power to pick the software they wanted, business software had no choice but to be simple enough for anyone to try and buy.</p>
<p>If a business application wasn’t easy to use, people just abandoned it and start trialing something else.&nbsp;Apps that had the best user experience started winning more often at work than the ones that didn’t.</p>
<p>Everyone called this trend ‘consumerization of business software/IT’. Dropbox, Google Drive, Docs and Sheets, etc led this era. But despite all efforts by business apps to keep things simple, consumer software continued to set the gold standard in user experience. Business software just followed the direction already set by consumer software products.</p>
<p>However, I think the scene is changing.</p>

<p>Look at Slack. Zoom. Typeform. They’ve gone above and beyond what we’d have expected of business software some years ago. They’re trendsetters in providing delightful user experiences, and they come out far ahead of similar consumer products in this space.</p>
<p>Can you think of another mainstream video calling software that’s as good as Zoom, for consumers? I can’t. About four weeks ago, my friends and I wanted to talk over WhatsApp but the app capped video call participants at 4. The quality of WhatsApp calls isn’t that great either (remember the “Reconnecting…” flashes?).</p>
<p><span> Zoom was top of mind for me because we use it at work every day. We switched to Zoom and everything worked just fine – there were no hiccups during the call, no onboarding problems, nothing at all. Seven people discovered Zoom that day, and all of them loved their first call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know several other folks who are defaulting to Zoom to stay in touch with their friends during this work-from-home season, despite WhatsApp, etc. being a tap away on their phones. That is saying <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> about how ahead of the pack Zoom is when it comes to group video/audio calling. Far ahead of consumer software in this space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I’m going to unpack what’s happening here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, <strong>a product that we use at work, nailed the calling experience.</strong> That’s a stark contrast from how sucky business software used to be, a decade ago.</li>
<li>Zoom enjoys <strong>fantastic brand recall</strong> – people spend hours on Zoom meetings every week (if not every day) so it’s on top of our minds when we’re thinking about calling our friends or family (ahead of consumer products that live in our phones.)</li>
<li>WhatsApp, <strong>a consumer product, didn’t impress us</strong> with the one job it was supposed to do (arbitrary limits be damned). Wasn’t consumer software supposed to be the gold standard in terms of user experience?</li>
<li>Seven of us <strong>switched to Zoom instantly</strong> and many of us went back to work to convince our closest teams to start using Zoom (network effects!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Business software like Zoom, etc. are so good that they’re winning against consumer software! If you said that to the person who had to deal with on-premise software and implementations ten or fifteen years ago, they’d certainly not believe it.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of products go from consumer to enterprise – Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. launched versions for work after they succeeded in the consumer space. But with us relying on work apps day in and day out and realizing that they’re so delightfully built, we are naturally taking them outside of our work lives and introducing them to our friends and family.</p>
<p>This is a massive opportunity that I think organizations are slowly realizing they need to chase – Microsoft, for instance, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/30/introducing-new-microsoft-365-personal-family-subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just launched</a> personal and family subscriptions for Office 365. Lots of people <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already use</a> Asana (and even Slack!) to organize their personal lives.</p>
<p>Even if revenue from consumers doesn’t significantly add to the bottom line for companies like Zoom etc., getting regular users to vouch about your product is definitely going to help take the brand mainstream (think about how well Skype is recognized even today, only because it was available for consumers for so long!).</p>
<p>That’s only going to lead to a cycle of more people discovering these products back at work – helping improve adoption for the business version.</p>
<p>And that’s something nobody will refuse wanting!</p>

It is also one of the poorest, with an annual&nbsp;per capita income of $870 US (<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD">at purchasing power parity</a>).</p>   <p>"When you are in Malawi and someone asks you, 'Where do you go to church?' and you say you don't pray, it's an awkward thing, like you're a weird person," says Teresa Chirwa, a journalist from Malawi who is spending an academic year at the University of Toronto.</p>   <p>The majority of Malawians belong to one of several Christian denominations (including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian and the African Independent Churches),&nbsp;while another 15 to 20 per cent are Muslim. Much of the population also practices traditional African religions.</p>   <p>In recent years, new Pentecostal churches have begun to take hold, and the younger generation has started making its own choices about which churches to attend&nbsp;— rather than following&nbsp; their parents' beliefs, said Chirwa.</p>   <p>"Kids are revolting," she said. "They are leaving the traditional churches and going to the new churches that are emerging."</p>   <p>The country now also has its&nbsp;first atheist organization, although so far, except for its leader, the names of all its members remain secret.</p>   <p>"They're being ridiculed by the society," said Chirwa. "They're being discriminated against for those beliefs."</p>  </div>  <p>Gregory Paul doesn't think it can. After constructing a "Successful Societies Scale" that compared 25 socioeconomic indicators against statistics on religious belief and practice in 17 developed nations, the Baltimore-based paleontologist concluded in a&nbsp;2009 study&nbsp;that "religion is most able to thrive in seriously dysfunctional societies."</p>  <p>Paul, who is a freelance researcher not affiliated with any institution, compiled data on everything from homicide rates and income inequality&nbsp;to infant mortality and teenage pregnancies and found that the societies that scored&nbsp;the best&nbsp;on socioeconomic indicators were also the most secular.</p>  <p>"The correlation between religiosity and successful societies is somewhere around 0.7. Zero&nbsp;is no correlation and&nbsp;one is a perfect correlation, so it's a really good correlation, and it's not just an accident," he told CBC News.</p>  <p>"There's no situation where you have a really highly religious nation that's highly successful socially."</p>  <p>Paul's intention in creating the scale was to&nbsp;challenge the idea that religion is universal and innate to the human condition, and to show that societies that don't believe in God are not doomed, as some religious conservatives would have people believe.</p>  <p>"Religion is highly variable, and therefore we need to ask why is it sometimes popular and why it isn't,"&nbsp;Paul said. "One thing we do know is that it's only popular in societies that&nbsp;… have enough rate of dysfunction that people are anxious about their daily lives, so they're looking to the gods for help in their daily lives.</p>  <p>"It's not fear of death that drives people to be religious, and it's not a God gene or a God module in the brain or some sort of connection with the gods; it's basically a psychological coping mechanism."</p>  <h3>Religion on decline in West</h3>  <p>Belief in God and participation in religious services have been on the decline in recent decades in most First World nations but have remained high in developing countries. Between 1947 and 2001, belief in God declined by 33.6 per cent in Sweden, 19.9 per cent in Australia and 7.2 per cent in Canada, according to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Articles/Articles%20published%20in%20journals_files/ppr2006%20norris.pdf">analysis</a>&nbsp;of social science surveys done by Harvard sociologist Pippa Norris and University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart.</p>  <p>Data for&nbsp;developing countries does not go back as far, but recent&nbsp;opinion polls&nbsp;suggest religiosity has remained high. The 10 most religious countries on the&nbsp;2012 WIN-Gallup International Religiosity and Atheism Index&nbsp;all had 85 per cent or more of respondents identifying as "a religious person," and all were countries with a per capita income&nbsp;of less than &nbsp;$14,100 US.</p>    <p>When Norris and Inglehart&nbsp;pooled 20 years of results from the World Values Survey, which regularly polls dozens of countries on social science questions, they found that in agrarian societies, 44 per cent of people said they attended church at least once a week compared to 25 per cent in industrial and 20 per cent in postindustrial societies. They also found that nations&nbsp;that scored&nbsp;low on the&nbsp;<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/">Human Development Index</a>, which measures health, education and living standards,&nbsp;tended to be those&nbsp;with the highest rates of participation in religious services and prayer.</p>  <div>   <h2>Religion, faith and belief</h2>   <p>This story launches a CBC News series looking at religion, faith and belief in our world.</p>  </div>  <p>More recent polls have found similar divisions between rich and poor nations. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx">2009 Gallup Inc. religion survey</a>, which sampled about 1,000 people in each of 114 countries, found that among nations with a per capita income of less than $2,000, 95 per cent of respondents, in the median, answered "Yes" to the question: "Is religion an important part of your daily life?"</p>  <p>In countries with per capita income of more than $25,000, 47 per cent of respondents answered "Yes." In Canada, 42 per cent of respondents said religion was important.</p>  <p>Bangladesh, Niger, Malawi and Yemen had some of the strongest&nbsp;positive responses (99 per cent) while Sweden (17 per cent), Denmark (19 per cent), Japan (24 per cent) and Estonia (16 per cent)&nbsp;— where religion was suppressed under the former Soviet regime&nbsp;— had some of the weakest.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>People walk past the Great Mosque in the ancient desert city of Agadez, Niger.

Wealthier states like Vermont and Maine were more comparable to Switzerland and Canada, the poll found.</p>  </div>  <p>"As lives gradually become more comfortable and secure, people in more affluent societies usually grow increasingly indifferent to religious values, more skeptical of supernatural beliefs and less willing to become actively engaged in religious institutions."</p>  <p>In poor countries, religious institutions often provide essential services such as education and health care, and the social networks that faith communities provide can be crucial in times of crisis.</p>    <p>"In the richer countries, people are less likely to face existential threats … so they have more opportunity for fulfillment outside of religion," Crabtree said.</p>  <p>But it's more than just an accumulation of wealth that makes a country more secular, sociologists say.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The United States is one of the wealthier societies, and yet, it's still quite religious," said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who has studied secularization in Scandinavian countries and wrote a book about it called <em>Society Without God</em>.</p>  <p>"I think it's when you have what we might call 'existential security'&nbsp;— so, wealth and prosperity are part of that, but by that we [also] mean the bulk of people in society have access to housing, health care, jobs. They live in a relatively stable, democratic society without much in the way of existential threats to their lives or their culture."</p>  <p>It's no accident, say some sociologists, that some of the world's least religious people live in nations …</p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>There is a number of online “alternative lifestyle” movements that have been gaining steam among millennials. They are appealing in their leanness: do more with less. At first, they seem cute and liberating. Scores of Instagram influencers and bloggers romanticize these lifestyles, and their subreddits are buzzing with zealots. Key examples below:</p> <p><strong>FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</strong>: live frugally now to save money as quickly as possible, then buy a place in a low cost-of-living area and live (mostly) off your savings.</p> <p><strong>Van Life</strong>: Buy a van, trick it out with a beautiful bed and a kitchen. Live lightly, travel the world, work remotely.</p> <p><strong>Tiny Houses</strong>: Nobody needs 5,000 square feet. Why not play with constraints, and build a full house with the square feet of a studio?</p> <p><strong>Remote Work</strong>: work your high-paying-job from a low-cost-of-living area, save up money, and save on commuting.</p> <p>While these lifestyles are marketed as all about freedom, they come with major restrictions: they are overwhelmingly for the single and childless. Having children is very expensive, so it’s hard to make that work with FIRE. On the other hand, van life and tiny houses are logistically prohibitive to having children. By going down these routes, their adherents will delay having kids, likely by years. That’s usually a bad trade.</p> <p>Not only do these lifestyles constrain, they also reflect a severe already-existing capital constraint. Broadly, <em>all</em> of these movements are reactions to poverty. Living in a van, tiny house, or remotely all stem from one factor: real estate in your preferred area (perhaps the place you call “home”) is too expensive. You can’t afford to buy or rent a real place there, so you move into an Instagrammable shed, or you move away altogether. These lifestyles are solutions to problems of poverty – but in making those solutions fashionable, they hide the ugly reality underneath.</p> <p>Ultimately, these movements romanticize and hide the true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials#In_the_United_States">generational poverty of millennials</a>. This is a generation of people who will never retire, who may never even buy real estate of their own. In terms of intergenerational wealth, these people are screwed. And I would like to see that point raised and addressed, instead of making do with solutions of desperation.</p> <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>Explorer is a power tool for GPT-3 experimentation with <strong>full history</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, and the community’s <strong>best-practices</strong> built-in. If you’re just getting started with GPT-3 or don’t want to build out your own boilerplate codebase, try the hosted version: <a href="https://gpt-3-explorer.vercel.app/">Explorer</a>. The source is available <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-ui-for-experimentation">A UI for experimentation</h2>

<p>To get good results from GPT-3, you need to experiment. (Despite what the cherry-picked examples on Twitter will have you believe!)</p>

<p>This fundamental insight led to Explorer’s first feature: saved history. They say the difference between tinkering and science is rigor and reproducibility. We codified that transition by making all our prompts and settings automatically saved and shareable. Annotations further allowed us to build and improve upon previous results.</p>

<p>Long term, we envision an environment that enables the development of higher level APIs on top of GPT-3. A system for designing pipelines of prompts, complex scripts, logic to retrieve external information — that can all be published for use in products and research.</p>

<p>Building complex applications requires you to work at a higher level of abstraction than machine code. <strong>How can we build an open source operating system for GPT-3 at the dawn of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>?</strong></p>

<h2 id="get-involved">Get involved!</h2>

<p>There’s a long road ahead and we’re thankful for all of your feedback and suggestions so far. We welcome code contributions to Explorer - pop over to <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">the repository</a> to learn how you can get it running locally!</p>

<p>Oh, and try it out <a href="https://gpt-3-explorer.vercel.app/">here</a> :)</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<h3 id="building-together">Building together</h3>

<p>The community is continually discovering incredible methods for unlocking GPT-3’s potential. Without the right set of tools, most practitioners struggle to find and implement these new techniques.</p>

<p>That’s where we see the need for an open source project where we can all rapidly experiment and codify what we’ve learned. Here are some of the community’s methods and best practices that we’re excited to incorporate as features in Explorer:</p>

<p><strong>Prompt chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This method skirts the token limit by “chaining” together prompts and their outputs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/chaining:chaining">Chaining</a> breaks down larger tasks into component sub-tasks, before composing them back together in a single prompt to get your final result.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context stuffing</strong></p>

<p>This is a method of iterative prompt improvement that involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Running an initial prompt</li>
  <li>Cherrypicking the best GPT-3 outputs,</li>
  <li>Appending them to the original prompt, to provide more examples for GPT-3 to use.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="the-roadmap">The Roadmap</h3>

<p>In the coming months, with your help, we plan to build these features (and more!). As the private beta comes to an end, let’s enable new GPT-3 users to hit the ground running with the cumulative, collective insights of the community.</p>

<p>As we receive feedback and contributions from the community, this roadmap will continue to change and be reprioritized. You can follow a live version of it <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer/projects/1">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing and importing prompts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“GitHub for Prompts”. Let’s make it easy to share and build on each others’ work!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt evaluation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>GPT’s performance is very, very sensitive to prompt design. So iterating on prompt design is our highest priority.</li>
  <li>With built-in tools for prompt evaluation, you can annotate, rank and sort results for the same task across different prompt designs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scripting &amp; chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable commands which can trigger scripts.</li>
  <li>These scripts can then: <em>i.</em> do computation, or <em>ii.</em> trigger API requests to do actions, get more information, call other prompts, etc.</li>
  <li>In particular, this scripting interface can chain prompts together.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Higher level API interface</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The OpenAI API is all about simplicity, it is a raw text-in, text-out interface, which is great to build on top of but does not make it easy to best take advantage of the tool.</li>
  <li>We envision a higher level API which you can use to develop higher-level reasoning and operations on top of the low level API. Turn any prompt, which itself can be a pipeline of other prompts, into an API.</li>
  <li>This enables a more broadly useful natural language interface for: chat, question answering, text transformations, multi-step labeling, and other pipelines of natural language operations</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <main id="main-content"> <section> <div>   <p>We’re excited to announce the first beta release and general availability of the <strong>Rome</strong> linter for JavaScript and TypeScript.</p> <p>This is the beginning of an entire suite of tools. Rome is not only linter, but also a compiler, bundler, test runner, and <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/#development-status">more</a>, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. We aim to unify the entire frontend development toolchain.</p> <p>Rome is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tool containing functionality that has traditionally been separate tools in the frontend ecosystem. We call this a toolchain. It is <strong>not</strong> a collection of existing tools, but completely custom, built <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/credits">largely</a> from scratch, contained entirely in a single package and codebase.</p> <p>Rome is designed to replace <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, and others.</p> <p>We have significant implementations already for most components, including compiling, bundling, and testing, all using the same core abstractions and internal libraries. Rome is even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)">self-hosted</a> and we use them to <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">build and develop Rome itself</a>! Once usage as a linter has stabilized, we will move onto the unreleased features to prepare and generalize them for public usage.</p> <p>Linting is an excellent low-risk way for us to mature and validate shared functionality like editor integration, configuration, parallelization, caching, parsing, and dependency analysis. It is not in the critical build path for development so is relatively straight forward and safe to adopt.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span> rome check

At the time I wasn’t trying to solve any particular problem, I was just building and experimenting with existing libraries and teaching myself new concepts. Over time though, as the project exploded in popularity, so did the scope and mission of the project.</p> <p>We renamed <strong>6to5</strong> to <strong>Babel</strong> to take on a new role as a general platform for doing static JavaScript transformation. This meant a plugin system and a new commitment to supporting future JavaScript standards and proposed features.</p> <p>We also planned on expanding Babel to be used as the base for other JavaScript language tooling by using shared public libraries. From the Babel blog post “<a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0">6.0.0 Released</a>” by <a href="https://twitter.com/buildsghost">Jamie Kyle</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>But we think we can go even further. Babel should be able to power minifiers, linters, formatters, syntax highlighters, code completion tools, type checkers, codemod tools, and every other tool to be using the same foundation to do their job better than ever before.</p> </blockquote> <figure> <img width="600" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/6to5-to-babel.png" alt="Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo"> <figcaption>Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo</figcaption> </figure> <p>In 2016, I left the project, and those plans never materialized. Over time, I learned the Babel would not have been able to successfully adapt to execute on this vision anyway. The solution to plugins was “expose all the internals” which is an extremely large API surface area to maintain and restricts your ability to make any changes.</p> <p>Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers.</p> <p>There would have been no way to provide backward compatibility, and with expectations already set, any significant changes to the project would have introduced an extremely high amount of ecosystem churn.</p> <p>In an ode to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a>, if all components of an object are replaced, is it the same object? There is far less confusion and friction to release something entirely new than drastically change something that’s already in widespread usage. I had since moved on from the project, and so any evolution would not have been possible, and would have required complete vision alignment.</p> <p>Even though I wasn’t involved in Babel, I still maintained a presence in the developer tooling ecosystem. I eventually went on to develop other tools like <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> and be involved in projects like <a href="https://prepack.io/">Prepack</a> and <a href="https://fbflipper.com/">Flipper</a>. This work continued to develop the ideas that would eventually become Rome and shaped my philosophy on developer experience. A focus on excellent errors, clean user interface, and minimal configuration.</p> <figure> <img width="500" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/introducing-rome-post-babel-logos.png" alt="The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper"> <figcaption>The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper</figcaption> </figure> <p>The original idea behind Babel had always stuck. What sort of capabilities would be possible if a tool did more than one thing? This sort of philosophy has always seemed alien in the JavaScript ecosystem where micropackages and arbitrary separation of concerns are the norms. These tools being independent has never provided the sort of user autonomy and efficiency that most skeptics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tools proclaim.</p> <p>Language tooling maintainers spend so much time working on the same things. Processing source code, whether it’s in a transpiler like Babel, linting it in ESLint, or bundling it in Webpack, is fundamentally the same problem with overlapping responsibilities and technical implementation.</p> <p>A linter in the JavaScript ecosystem is exactly the same as a compiler. They both consume code, then produce compiled code and errors. What the compiled code is varies. In the case of a linter, the compiled code is formatted source code with automatic fixes applied. The more powerful your compilation infrastructure, the more theoretically powerful your linter could be. These commonalities extend to pretty much anything that involves language processing. We can build more powerful tools using a shared base that is easily adaptable.</p> <p>I had always maintained private repos where I would experiment with ideas, but the original code that would become Rome was started at the beginning of 2017 while I was working for Facebook in my free time. I continued iterating and experimenting on the idea and building out all the different pieces, until 2019, when I was given the opportunity to work on and explore using it at Facebook full-time.</p> <p>I eventually left Facebook and the project became open source in February 2020 where I would continue it as an independent community-driven project.</p> <p>Rome is the spiritual successor of Babel. I’ve taken the lessons I learnt, and refined the mission. Rather than exposing a large public API for other tools to be built on, we are building them all in one place, with batteries included. I’m excited to be trying something new that the JavaScript and web ecosystem haven’t seen before.</p> <p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck">Sebastian McKenzie</a></p> </section>  </div> </section> </main> </div></div>]]>

                    <p>In this article, we will learn about India's Unified Payments Interface. A four-year-old payment scheme that has been accounting for 40-45% of digital payments across India. In December 2019, Google <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2019/November/20191113/OP-1670/OP-1670_110719_136981_396266957468_1.pdf">recommended</a> the Federal Reserve to follow the model of UPI for the design of FedNow.</p><p>It is going to be a 3 part series.</p><p><strong>Part 1 </strong>(this article): We will cover the background and basics. We will learn about the different participants and their roles in the UPI ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-transaction-lifecycle"><strong>Part 2:</strong></a> We take a deep-dive into UPI by tracing a UPI transaction from the beginning through the end.</p><p><strong><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-settlement">Part 3:</a></strong> We will look at settlements and understand how money exchanges hands.</p><hr><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>Since its inception in 2016, UPI has grown tremendously over the last 4 years. It has enabled a whole new set of individuals to transact digitally for the first time.</p><p>There were multiple attempts towards making India a cashless society. Earlier solutions were not simple to use and relied heavily on Netbanking facilities provided by the banks. The experience was not standard. Because of all these reasons, it was mostly used only by the tech-savvy population. India being a diverse country needed a system that has a plethora of payment apps that are optimised for different cohorts.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png" alt="" width="1468" height="1088" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1468w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Growth of UPI</figcaption></figure><p>The primary objective of UPI was to build an open payment system that is mobile-first, fast, and interoperable across different banks.</p><p>For a developing country like India, going mobile-first was almost a no brainer. Mobile Phones and Mobile Data were getting cheaper and the trend was clear.</p><p>Interoperability simply puts the user’s needs at the center. The users can opt for any payment app, link it with their bank account to engage in commerce with anyone across India.</p><p>Think about it, all of us want to use payment apps that we like, instead of being limited to a poorly designed app that’s provided by the bank where we keep our money. We should let banks do what they do best (which is managing money) and let tech companies handle building intuitive user interfaces for transacting money.</p><p>UPI was built on this principle to let private players innovate on top of public digital infrastructure.</p><h3 id="so-what-exactly-is-upi">So, What exactly is UPI?</h3><p>UPI is a payment markup language and a standard for interoperable payments in India.</p><p>To make the process of transacting money simple, UPI introduced the concept of human friendly unique IDs called UPI Virtual Payment Addresses (or VPAs). The VPAs are usually of the form <strong><em>&lt;unique_identifier&gt;</em></strong>@<strong><em>&lt;address_provider&gt;</em></strong>.</p><p>The UPI VPAs are similar to email addresses. They are interoperable. A gmail user can send an email to a yahoo user. </p><p>Some simple examples UPI VPAs are <strong><em>alice@ybl </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob@axis</em></strong>. Here, <strong><em>ybl</em></strong> and <strong><em>axis </em></strong>are two banks that provide virtual payment addresses. And, <strong><em>alice </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob </em></strong>are the unique identifiers in respective address providers.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1064" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/payment_markup.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Just like how domains get resolved to IP addresses, every VPA needs to be linked to a bank account. The UPI handles get resolved to bank accounts and IFSC during the payment (we will see how).</p><p>In short, a UPI Virtual Payment Address serves as the addressing layer for a bank account.</p><p>There are mainly two types of transactions in the UPI realm.</p><h4 id="direct-payment">Direct Payment</h4><p>The payer (the sender) initiates the transaction. Typical examples would be, you paying a shopkeeper at the checkout by scanning a QR code or you sending money to your friends and family.</p><h4 id="collect-request">Collect Request</h4><p>The payee (the receiver) initiates the transaction. A simple example is a scenario where your landlord creates a collect request asking you to pay the monthly rent.</p><hr><h2 id="the-ecosystem">The Ecosystem</h2><p>There are three types of participants in the UPI ecosystem.</p><h3 id="the-banks">The Banks</h3><p>Banks hold your money. UPI works directly with the bank accounts, unlike Paytm, Venmo, or CashApp. The bank account will be debited from or credited to whenever you send money or receive money.</p><p>The banks that hold your money are also called <em>Issuing Banks</em>.</p><p>Every bank uses a system called Core Banking System (CBS) to manage its user’s accounts. At the core, CBS is a simple <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud" rel="noopener">CRUD</a> system built around user accounts.</p><p>Debit and Credit are the two fundamental operations of core banking software.The debit is when you’re taking money out of your account. The amount involved is subtracted from your balance. On the other hand, when you’re getting paid, its a credit. The money is added to your account.</p><p>Banks also maintain another UPI specific database. We will discuss more on that later.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png" alt="" width="2328" height="1840" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png 2328w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-payment-apps">The Payment Apps</h3><p>Payment Apps are consumer-centric products that can be used to link a bank account and transact in the real world. Some major apps are Google Pay, PhonePe, BHIM, etc. Almost all the banks have their own versions of UPI Apps. There is a wide variety of options to chose from.</p><p>Payment Apps allow users to create handles to make everyday transactions easier. However, not everyone can start creating UPI handles. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates who can create UPI handles. Currently, only the member banks of the UPI ecosystem are allowed to do so.</p><p>That’s why all the payment apps will have to tie up with banks. These banks not only allow payment apps to create and manage UPI handles for their users, but they are also the interface to the UPI ecosystem.</p><p>These banks are called <em>Acquiring Banks</em>.</p><p>Google Pay has tied up with HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI. PhonePe has a tie-up with Yes Bank and ICICI Bank.</p><p>Banks provide separate APIs to allow payment apps to create and manage the UPI handles.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png" alt="" width="2540" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="npci">NPCI</h3><p>National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a non-profit set up by the Government of India to facilitate digital payments. They facilitate many payment schemes (like IMPS, BBPS, FASTag, etc.)</p><p>If we reflect back on the original objective of UPI, it was to build an interoperable system. An interoperable means anyone could download a payment app, link any bank (that they own), and transact with anyone else from any other bank.</p><p>One primitive way of building such an interoperable network would be to connect every payment app with every bank. As you’re probably guessing, that’s a very inefficient way of doing it, even if we assume something like that is possible. It practically not possible.</p><p>And, the only thing that’s constant in the software realm, is the fact that systems keep changing and breaking. Imagine the pain that everyone has to go through in reaching a consensus when configurations or infrastructures change. It would be chaos.</p><p>This approach is the same as building an Internet where your browser has to remember the IP address of every possible website on the planet, otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to access it.</p><p>Of course, the Internet is not built in this fashion. The job of resolving every web address into an IP address is taken out as a separate protocol called DNS. Our browsers trust the IP address resolved by the DNS servers used by our Internet Service Providers.</p><p>Introducing standardization and a trusted third party will result in a completely different architecture.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png" alt="" width="3000" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>That’s the route UPI creators took, they made NPCI as the trusted switch and they standardized the protocol. NPCI makes sure that data flow between banks and payment apps are routed to the correct and verified destinations.</p><p>The end result, the payment apps, and banks talk just to NPCI and can be assured by NPCI that they are really interacting with who they intend to.</p><p>To make this easy to understand, we made a GIF.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="851" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Apart from being the trusted router, NPCI also hosts non-financial meta APIs to serve everyone in the ecosystem.</p><p>Some examples of meta API are <em>listAccountProviders (returns all details of all banks), validateAddress (helps in validating VPAs), requestOtp (for 2FA), </em>etc.</p><p>NPCI has one more important role to play. It’s something to do with settlement. We will cover in the last part of the series.</p><hr><p>Before we wrap the first series, let's quickly visit authentication.</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>UPI uses 2-factor authentication. Commonly used factors are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Possession_factors" rel="noopener">possession factor</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Knowledge_factors" rel="noopener">knowledge factor</a>.</p><p>UPI being mobile-first, the possession factor (“what a user has”) is the user’s phone.

<p><a href="https://www.prepear.com/">Prepear</a> is a meal planner and grocery list app that helps people discover recipes and more. It’s a spin off from the founders of <em><a href="https://www.superhealthykids.com/">Super Healthy Kids</a></em> and right now they saying its logo is under legal attack from Apple.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>It’s funny what Instagram accounts you follow as a parent at some point. Yesterday, we noticed <em>Super Healthy Kids</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmcFEInZK7/">sharing a post</a> detailing their new legal woes with Apple.</p>
<p>According to the founders, Apple “has opposed the trademark application for our small business, Prepear, demanding that we change our obviously pear shaped logo, used to represent our brand in the recipe management and meal planning business.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">In a petition on Change.org</a>, Prepear goes on to say, “before attacking us, Apple has opposed dozens of other trademark applications filed by small businesses with fruit related logos. Many of those logos were changed or abandoned. Most small businesses cannot afford the tens of thousands of dollars it would cost to fight Apple.”</p>
<p>Prepear says they are a small company with only five staff and legal costs have already cost them “many thousands of dollars” plus laying off one team member, in their legal fight against the iPhone maker.</p>
<p>“It is a very terrifying experience to be legally attacked by one of the largest companies in the world, even when we have clearly done nothing wrong, and we understand why most companies just give in and change their logos,” adds Prepear in its plea for support.</p>
<p>Prepear says they “feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple’s aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.”</p>
<p>So far, just over 8,200 signatures have been signed out of a goal of 10,000 on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">change.org</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the two logos above, I can’t say the Prepear logo resembles the Apple logo at all. But of course, Apple feels different about that.</p>
<p>Prepear is a free app and available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prepear/id1248495163">download on iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prepear.android&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: You can check out Apple’s trademark opposition filed above (via <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/08/legal-action-against-company-with-pear-logo/">MacRumors</a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Update August 9</strong>: Prepear’s COO, Russ Monson, told <em>iPhone in Canada</em> in an email more insight in regards to the company’s filing of their trademark for the ‘pear’ logo.</p>
<p>Monson says Prepear filed their trademark for the logo back in January 2017 and eventually was told by the U.S. Trademark office “that it was not in conflict with any other registered trademarks and that they would publish it for opposition.” Everything seemed good to go.</p>
<p>That was until on the “on the last day of the window to oppose the trademark we received notice that Apple had filed for an extension of the window to oppose, and they subsequently filed for additional extensions which put our trademark in legal limbo for an extended period of time.”</p>
<p>According to Monson, Apple filed their actual opposition on the final day they were legally allowed. Subsequent extensions filed result in more legal fees for a company like Prepear to take on, which they said “seemed designed by their legal team to be made as long, difficult, and expensive as possible for us.”</p>
<p>Monson goes on to explain Prepear was “naive enough” to think they could discuss the matter with Apple rationally, as both logos look different. But that wasn’t the case and the opposition has reached the ‘discovery phase’, which the COO says will “be the most expensive part of this case for us.”</p>
<p>After Apple filed to proceed to discovery phase, that’s what Prepear decided to start their petition. “We believe that this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple’s position on this that Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than have the public see how they are clearly harming us for no apparent justifiable reason,” said Monson to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em></p>
<p>Prepear says they aren’t asking for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone maker to “stop attacking small businesses like ours in frivolous cases that seem designed to cause us to spend as much money and time thinking about the case instead of focusing on how to grow our business and ensure we survive the current economic crisis.”</p>
<p>Monson shared with<em> iPhone in Canada</em> some other oppositions Apple had previously filed against, in a similar fashion to what is happening them right now. These companies below gave up when Apple reached out, but Prepear says they are lucky to garner enough media attention “to expose this practice by Apple.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-992x1042.jpg" alt="" width="992" height="1042" srcset="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-992x1042.jpg 992w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-333x350.jpg 333w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-457x480.jpg 457w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-768x807.jpg 768w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-660x693.jpg 660w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-560x588.jpg 560w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit.jpg 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px"></a></p>
<p>Prepear says it will be handing its petition of signatures–which currently stands at nearly 19,000 signatures–to Apple soon and will be sharing updates on what happens. The company explains to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it hopes Apple will drop the case before it gets to more expensive discovery and trial phases.</p>

If you’ve used Snap Search, you’ll find lots of banners and vector images used throughout the app. However, it comes with a very obvious risk: loading large images can slow down your app, and increase the apk size. I have a <strong><em>total 321 files in the drawable folder</em></strong> for Snap Search, and the following method is my easy trick to reduce APK size on Android.</p> <p>For those who are in a hurry and just want to know it quickly, these are the steps I follow:</p><ul><li>Save your image as a .png file</li><li>Compress your image using <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a></li><li>Add the compressed image to your drawable folder</li><li>Right click on file, select ‘Convert o WebP’</li></ul><p>This whole process, on an average compresses the image by almost 80-90%. The images do NOT lose any quality at all, and your UI is still snappy and responsive to load and use.</p><p>Let’s check an example:</p><h2>Example to Reduce APK Size</h2><p>Here’s an example of an image in Snap Search, highlighting one of the premium features ( <a href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/">there are quite a few</a>

    <p>So far everything we’ve done with breakpoints involved us creating a breakpoint file and using this
to automate part of a track. Now we’ll take a look at how we can take an existing track and extract
some breakpoints from this. For this post, we’ll take a look at extracting the amplitudes from the
.wave files, as this is one of the most straightforward properties that we can extract.</p>
<p>There is nothing here that we’ve not seen in the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/tags/goaudio/">previous
posts</a>, but rather we are going to combine what we’ve
already learned to create a new tool to do this.</p>
<p>In a high level overview, we’ll have to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>iterate over our frames</li>
<li>record the given amplitude (frame value)</li>
<li>write to breakpoint file</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence this would be simple enough, but we’ll make two small modifications to this
algorithm. First of all, we don’t want to just generate a breakpoint for each frame, this would just
result in a list that is equal to our frame data. We’ll use less space by just taking a snapshot at
a certain interval, e.g every 10ms, and take advantage of
our linear interpolation that happens when looking up the value of a breakpoint at a certain time.</p>
<p>A small extention to our current breakpoint code is that we need to be able to ‘batch’ the samples
into slices of a given time.</p>
<p>If you want to get to the code, everything can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/cmd/extractbrk/main.go">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The BatchSamples function will take a <code>Wave</code> and <code>seconds float64</code> as input, as this gives us enough
data to batch the frames. Given a certain SampleRate, we know how many Samples per Second we are
seeing in the file. With this information, we can find the amount of Frames per Seconds. Although
frames per second is only equal to the samples per second for mono files, but adapting for
multi-channel audio is just a matter of multiplying the SampleSize by the amount of channels.</p>
<p>The SampleSize can thus be expressed as follows: <code>SampleSize = SampleRate * Channels * seconds</code></p>
<p>When we know our sample size, we can split the raw frames into slices of this size.</p>

<p>Once we can split our frames into batches, we can call <code>BatchSamples(wave,x)</code> to get the requested
batches of a given duration. Then, we can find the max amplitude over all of these and keep
track of this over all batches.</p>
<p>The setup code is the same as usual, where we parse an input file with
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a>. Except that now we’ll also send the frames to the
‘BatchSamples’ function. (Error handling ignored for brevity)</p>

them and collecting the max amplitude found in each. As we’ll need to write this to an output file
in the end, we’ll store this in a StringBuilder for now.</p>
<p>One more thing we have to keep track of is which time will be inserted in the <code>time:value</code> pair for
the breakpoint file. This time value will be a 15ms increment for each batch.</p>

<p>When we run this program <code>go run main.go -i input.wav -w 15 -o output.brk</code> we can generate a
breakpoint file. I’ve created a sample waveform (something I’ll write a future blogpost about) with
variable amplitude. You can listen to it <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/input.wav">here</a>.</p>
<p>The extracted breakpoint file can be seen <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/output.brk">here</a>.</p>
<p>Using audacity and your favourite plotting tool you can compare the waveform with what the
breakpoint extractor generated.</p>

Phone addiction or compulsive phone use goes along-side internet addiction and social media addiction. Psychologists also call it “problematic phone use.” For this post, we will consider them together. Cell-phones are habit-forming – once you go down that rabbit hole, you use more and more. Like drugs, one can get hooked to a phone or an activity on the phone that leads to addiction. There is abuse without control, changes in mood, excessive desire to use, withdrawals like irritability and anger when you can’t use the phone, low tolerance to avoid the phone, and the phone interferes with life in a negative way.</p><p>Strictly speaking, addiction is “the loss of control, the establishment of a dependent relationship, tolerance, the need for progressively more time and dedication, and severe interference with daily life (Echeburua et al., 2009).” Phones, internet-based activities, and any technology for that matter can become an addiction in the truest sense (even though many disagree). And sometimes, phone addicts need to be rehabilitated in a hospital.</p><p>People often get addicted to the phone because they want to <em>escape from reality</em>, <em>gain social karma</em>, <em>cope with stress caused by social anxiety and self-esteem</em>, <em>follow their greed for social validation</em>, <em>likes</em>, <em>and other types of rewards</em>, or <em>play rewarding games</em>. The constant flow of digital rewards and information can <em>pull</em> a person into addiction and day-to-day difficulties can <em>push</em> a person toward addiction.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1" alt="Phone addiction" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div><h3><span id="Indicators_of_problematic_phone_use">Indicators of problematic phone use</span></h3><p><strong>There is no cut-off point for phone use which everyone agrees to but here are some indicators</strong>.</p><ol><li>You spend continuous hours on the phone to play games, scroll through social media, open and close apps, text people to invite a chat, etc.</li><li>You frequently pick up the phone without any aim to check for notifications or see if something has changed in your social feeds.</li><li>Your online and offline behavior gets more integrated and you don’t know what you did in the digital reality or the material reality.</li><li>You get restless if your phone is dead or has low-battery, is out-of-coverage, or low on data/balance.</li><li>You treat your phone as a security blanket without which you get uncomfortable in social gatherings.</li><li>Your day-to-day activities take a backseat, relationships are strained, and you can’t focus and commit to the important things in your life.</li></ol><h3><span id="Common_examples_of_problematic_phone_use">Common examples of problematic phone use</span></h3><ol><li>Infinitely scrolling through Instagram.</li><li>Playing Call of Duty or PubG for hours and social activities contain little to no honest communication.</li><li>Excessive display of hurt, loneliness, attention-seeking behavior, hate, jealousy, and disapproval on social media.</li><li>Social needs are not met (sexual intimacy, close friendship, physical touch, etc.) and online alternatives are used to compensate for poor social health (Chatbots, echo-chambers, porn, social gaming, virtual reality social games like second life, camming relationships).</li><li>Inability to feel pleasure and excitement in the offline world but excessive emotions are tied to online rewards like gambling, likes, shares, followers, sexting, masturbation to porn, etc.</li><li><em>FOMO</em> (fear of missing out) and <em>Nomophobia</em> (no-mobile phobia) cause mental and physical discomfort.</li><li>You frequently experience <em>Ringxiety</em> or <em>Textaphrenia</em> or Phantom notifications – the feeling that you received a notification when you actually did not.</li></ol><h2><span id="Fast_facts_about_phone_and_internet_use">Fast facts about phone and internet use</span></h2><ol><li><a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to a 2019 report</a>, the average person spends about 3.5 hours on their phone in a day with the top 20% of people spending more than 4.5 hours a day. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The quarantine</a> has increased these numbers – many users report over 8 hours a day.</li><li>The 2019 report also says that 70% of all phone use lasts lesser than 2 minutes and 50% of all phone pick-ups occur within 3 minutes of the previous pick-up.</li><li><a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2019/01/digital-2019-global-internet-use-accelerates" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Another 2019 report</a> (2018 data) says at least 3.3 billion people use the internet and social media from their phones.</li><li><a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2019/Global-State-of-Mobile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Comscore’s 2019 Global state of mobile</a> report says 70% of all digital media engagement in the US happens from a smartphone.

That means poor attention, poor memory, poor reasoning skills, bad decision making, etc. One of the main reasons is the role of sleep. Addiction can disturb sleep and sleep worsens cognitive performance. However, self-regulation (personal control, commitment to healthy choices, tolerating negative emotions) can counter the negative effects of addiction and that can help you overcome it.</p><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740919311296" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">A dysfunctional family can push</a> children into addiction and one reason is social anxiety. A broken family or unhealthy parenting like neglect or excessive control can often hamper emotional growth. Children might fail to learn how to behave in social settings. There may be a fear of ridicule, disapproval, disappointment, etc. or simply a looming belief like “I am not good enough” or “I am a bad child” that creates pressure on children. These fears or thoughts transfer into the real-world and children cope with the social anxiety it causes by withdrawing into their phones – where the fantasy digital world rescues them from their real life. Fortunately, mindfulness – being aware of your actions and living in the moment as an observer – can reduce the negative impact of phone addiction.</p><p>Underlying mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and attachment issues can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215249/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">increase the risk</a> of phone addiction. And improving mental health can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4354213/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">counter addiction</a>.</p><h2><span id="9_Ways_to_overcome_phone_addiction">9 Ways to overcome phone addiction</span></h2><h3><span id="1_Schedule_a_time_for_un-monitored_phone_use">1.&nbsp;<strong>Schedule a time for un-monitored phone use</strong></span></h3><p>Grant yourself as much time as you want within a fixed daily limit at a specific hour of the day. As long as you can first demonstrate some output. Random notifications and random experiences are potent in pulling you to check your phone precisely because they are random. Unpredictable notifications and call-to-actions are hard to anticipate so the brain maximizes their potential reward (feeling great) by constantly creating the urge to pick up the phone and check. Schedule an hour to commit to your phone or make it a rule to check it every 45 minutes. That way, the rewards will be hard to anticipate but they will occur at a known time and your brain will find it easier to adjust than completely abandoning your phone.</p><h3><span id="2_Interrupt_your_habitual_routine">2.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt your habitual routine</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Habits are hard to break because neurons in your brain rigidly fire a certain way. Once an action is repeated enough, neural circuits become efficient. They then direct and dictate behavior automatically. Countering their tendencies becomes harder. Higher the repetitions, the more stable those neurons get. These neural circuits fire in a predictable way and they fire automatically with almost no external push. You may have little to no awareness about the start of habitual actions. However, breaking a habit means you have to change how those neurons behave and the only way to do that is to ensure a change in the neural circuit. You can do that by changing 3 things:</p><ul><li><strong>The context in which the habit occurs</strong> – Identify how your mood is when you get into the phone-use black hole and do an activity that changes the mood. Instead of sitting and scrolling, start cleaning up or begin work, and occasionally take a phone break.</li><li><strong>Interrupting the trigger that kick-starts the habit</strong> – Identify the triggers and immediately distract yourself, change the room, go for a bath, etc.</li><li><strong>The verbal narrative about that habit</strong> – Change your self-talk about phone addiction. For example, change “I need to use my phone, I want to do that right now” to “I can use a strategy to use my phone in a limited way so I don’t stay an addict and still enjoy it.”</li></ul><p>For example – If you have a habit of staring at your phone right after writing an email,&nbsp;<strong>change the context</strong>&nbsp;by doing a physical stretch.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt the trigger</strong>&nbsp;by clicking send and then switching off your phone immediately. And&nbsp;<strong>change the narrative</strong>&nbsp;by telling yourself something like “<em>The email was not the end of my work, I can start another task and then go on Instagram.</em>” Even if this just delays your phone use by a few minutes, it’s progress.</p><h3><span id="3_Introspect_about_your_expectations">3.&nbsp;<strong>Introspect about your expectations</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Continuous short-interval phone checking may …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">

<p>I bought Avnet's $49 Spartan 3A development board but it was discontinued not long afterward - right about the time when I decided I needed a few dozen more. I've since done some extensive research (thanks, Google!) to find a comparable thrifty thrill.
</p>
<p>When choosing a development board, consider what you get with it and what you want to use it for. FPGAs are ideal for use with high speed peripherals, and in general it is much easier to buy a board that contains the part you want, rather than trying to add one on later (and inevitably giving up and upgrading to a more capable board). Examples of things you might want, and are quite difficult to add yourself:
</p>
<ul><li>Gigabit Ethernet
</li><li>HDMI/DVI
</li><li>PCI/PCI Express
</li><li>External non-serial memory (DDR/Flash etc.)
</li></ul><p>Things that are relatively easy to add, and are not so much of a big deal to wire up yourself.
</p>
<ul><li>MMC/SD cards
</li><li>Character (e.g. 16x2) LCDs
</li><li>Anything I2C/SPI and relatively low speed
</li><li>VGA (with low colour depth)
</li></ul><p>I like having a board with many (at least 8) SPST switches and LEDs, and momentary buttons. Unlike a microcontroller where it's relatively easy to spit debug information out of a serial port or to an LCD with a single C function call, debugging FPGA designs is a bit harder. LEDs  provide a zero fuss way to break out internal signals for visualisation - if you're tracking the progress of a complex state machine, you can light up an LED when it gets to a certain point without adding any extra logic. While these are easy enough to add yourself, I find that it's better to get a board that has them so that you don't waste valuable user IOs or waste time investigating failures caused by your terrible soldering skills.
</p>
<p>Some manufacturers promote a standard form factor for add-ons, notably Digilent with their very wide range of <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/">Pmods</a>, the Papilio One's <a href="http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Wings">Wings</a>, and Arduino shields.
</p>
<p>If you would like to connect high speed devices (above 10-20 MHz) to your FPGA, make sure your board has an interface connector that supports the speeds you'll be using. Look for ground wires interspersed regularly between signal wires, high speed connectors (not just 0.1" headers), PCB trace length equalisation, and impedance control. Few of the cheap boards bother with any of these.
</p>
<p>FPGAs can be a bit daunting, so check that the manufacturer provides:
</p>
<ul><li>Schematic diagram
</li><li>A reference manual, describing all of the on-board peripherals
</li><li>A guide to getting started, if you've never used an FPGA before
</li><li>A reference design that exercises all on-board peripherals.
</li></ul><p>Reference designs can either be HDL or microcontroller-based, but in recent boards, most manufacturers seem to be moving to the latter. Bear this in mind if you don't have a license for the microcontroller and environment (e.g. Xilinx EDK/SDK is not free), as the code will be difficult to port to HDL.
</p>
<p>If you're a beginner, you may benefit from buying a board that has a companion textbook which has been written specifically for the board in mind, and describes each of the peripherals and how to interface with them. Popular boards with larger user communities may also be worth considering above cheaper options. The most popular Xilinx boards are those made by Xilinx (none of them cheap enough to be listed here), Digilent and Avnet. Terasic seem to make the most popular Altera boards.
</p>

<p>A long-standing complaint with vendor FPGA design tools is that they are generally enormous, complicated, slow, buggy, closed source, and are either expensive or have annoying license requirements. The open source community has made great progress in recent years to reimplement parts or all of the FPGA design toolchain and to address all of these concerns.
</p>
<p>FPGA devices which are currently either partially or fully supported by open source tools include:
</p>
<ul><li>Xilinx Spartan 6
</li><li>Xilinx Series 7 (Artix 7, Kintex 7, Virtex 7, Zynq with Series 7 Fabric)
</li><li>Xilinx Ultrascale(+)
</li><li>Lattice iCE40
</li><li>Lattice ECP5
</li><li>QuickLogic EOS S3 and PolarPro3
</li></ul><p>Some tools to check out include:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex">LiteX</a> - A Python-based SoC builder
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/litex-hub">LiteX Hub</a> - collaborative FPGA projects based on LiteX
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv">LiteX-BuildEnv</a> - An environment for building LiteX-based FPGA designs
</li></ul></li><li><a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> - Verilog synthesis tool
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr">nextpnr</a> - a vendor neutral, timing driven place and route tool
</li><li><a href="https://symbiflow.github.io/">SymbiFlow</a> - an umbrella project for FPGA architecture definitions
</li></ul><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mithro">Tim 'mithro' Ansell</a> has an open offer to send FPGA hardware to anyone who has time to to contribute to open source FPGA projects but doesn't have any hardware.

<p>If you read a description of a static analysis in a paper, what might you find? There’ll be some cute model of a language. Maybe some inference rules describing the analysis itself, but those rules probably rely on a variety of helper functions. These days, the analysis likely involves some logical reasoning: about the terms in the language, the branches conditionals might take, and so on.</p>



<p>What makes a language good for implementing such an analysis? You’d want a variety of features:</p>



<ul><li>Algebraic data types to model the language AST.</li><li>Logic programming for cleanly specifying inference rules.</li><li>Pure functional code for writing the helper functions.</li><li>An SMT solver for answering logical queries.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~bembenek/">Aaron Bembenek</a>, <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/">Steve Chong</a>, and I have developed a design that hits the sweet spot of those four points: given Datalog as a core, you add constructors, pure ML, and a type-safe interface to SMT. If you set things up just right, the system is a powerful and ergonomic way to write static analyses.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog">Formulog</a> is our prototype implementation of our design; our <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">paper on Formulog and its design</a> was just conditionally accepted to <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-oopsla">OOPSLA 2020</a>. To give a sense of why I’m excited, let me excerpt from our <a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog/blob/master/examples/liquid_types.flg">simple liquid type checker</a>. Weighing in under 400 very short lines, it’s a nice showcase of how expressive Formulog is. (Our paper discusses substantially more complex examples.)</p>



<pre>type base =
&nbsp;&nbsp;| base_bool

type typ = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_tvar(tvar)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_fun(var, typ, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_forall(tvar, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_ref(var, base, exp)

and exp = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(var)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(bool)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(op)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(var, typ, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(tvar, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(exp, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(exp, typ)
</pre>



<p>ADTs let you define your AST in a straightforward way. Here, <code>bool</code> is our only base type, but we could add more. Let’s look at some of the inference rules:</p>



<pre>(* subtyping *)
output sub(ctx, typ, typ)

(* bidirectional typing rules *)
output synth(ctx, exp, typ)
output check(ctx, exp, typ)

(* subtyping between refinement types is implication *)
sub(G, typ_ref(X, B, E1), typ_ref(Y, B, E2)) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_ctx(G),
&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_subst(Y, exp_var(X), E2) = E2prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_ctx(G, PhiG),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E1, Phi1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E2prime, Phi2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;is_valid(`PhiG /\ Phi1 ==&gt; Phi2`).

(* lambda and application synth rules *)
synth(G, exp_lam(X, T1, E), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_typ(G, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(ctx_var(G, X, T1), E, T2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_fun(X, T1, T2) = T.

synth(G, exp_app(E1, E2), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E1, typ_fun(X, T1, T2)),
&nbsp;&nbsp;check(G, E2, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E2, T2) = T.

(* the only checking rule *)
check(G, E, T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E, Tprime),
&nbsp;&nbsp;sub(G, Tprime, T).</pre>



<p>First, we declare our relations—that is, the (typed) inference rules we’ll be using. We show the most interesting case of subtyping: refinement implication. Several helper relations (<code>wf_ctx</code>, <code>encode_*</code>) and helper functions (<code>exp_subst</code>) patch things together. The typing rules below follow a similar pattern, mixing the <code>synth</code> and <code>check</code> bidirectional typing relations with calls to helper functions like <code>typ_subst</code>.</p>



<pre>fun exp_subst(X: var, E : exp, Etgt : exp) : exp =
&nbsp;&nbsp;match Etgt with
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(Y) =&gt; if X = Y then E else Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(Y, Tlam, Elam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Yfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fresh_for(Y, X::append(typ_freevars(Tlam), exp_freevars(Elam)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Elamfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Y = Yfresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Elam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else exp_subst(Y, exp_var(Yfresh), Elam)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_lam(Yfresh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E, Tlam),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elamfresh)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(A, Etlam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tlam(A, exp_subst(X, E, Etlam))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(E1, E2) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_app(exp_subst(X, E, E1), exp_subst(X, E, E2))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(Etapp, T) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tapp(exp_subst(X, E, Etapp), typ_subst(X, E, T))
&nbsp;&nbsp;end</pre>



<p>Expression substitution might be boring, but it shows the ML fragment well enough. It’s more or less the usual ML, though functions need to have pure interfaces, and we have a few restrictions in place to keep typing simple in our prototype.</p>



<p>There’s lots of fun stuff that doesn’t make it into this example: not only can relations call functions, but functions can examine relations (so long as everything is stratified). Hiding inside <code>fresh_for</code> is a clever approach to name generation that guarantees freshness… but is also deterministic and won’t interfere with parallel execution. The <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> has more substantial examples.</p>



<p>We’re not the first to combine logic programming and SMT. What makes our design a sweet spot is that it doesn’t let SMT get in the way of Datalog’s straightforward and powerful execution model. Datalog execution is readily parallelizable; the magic sets transformation can turn Datalog’s exhaustive, bottom-up search into a goal-directed one. It’s not news that Datalog can turn these tricks—<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yanniss/doop/src/master/">Yiannis Smaragdakis has been saying it for years</a>!—but integrating Datalog cleanly with ML functions and SMT is new. Check out the <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> for a detailed related work comparison. While our design is, in the end, not so complicated, getting there was hard.</p>



<p>Relatedly, we have also have an <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/iclp2020_extabs.pdf">extended abstract at ICLP 2020</a>, detailing some experiments in using incremental solving modes from Formulog. You might worry that Datalog’s BFS (or heuristic) strategy wouldn’t work with an SMT solver’s push/pop (i.e., DFS) assertion stack—but a few implementation tricks and <code>check-sat-assuming</code> indeed provide speedups.</p>

<p><em>India’s first lunar mission, Chandrayaan 1, <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">confirmed the presence</a> of water on the Moon. It was a groundbreaking achievement for its Mission Director, Srinivasa Hegde, who worked at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for 36 years, from 1978 to 2014. At&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/u-r-rao-satellite-centre-ursc" target="_blank">ISRO’s Satellite Center</a> in Bangalore, he was involved in planning, analysis and operations for dozens of space missions.</em></p>

<h5><strong>What first got you interested in space exploration?</strong></h5>



<p>As a kid, I was influenced by my grandfather. He was a Sanskrit scholar and an astrologer, with a love for stars in the sky. He used to take me for early morning walks before dawn. During those days of reduced pollution, many constellations were clearly visible. He used to identify and explain all the constellations to me and I was intrigued. Besides, I was generally interested in science and reading up on new discoveries and happenings in the field. Then one day I came across a job opening at ISRO for which I applied and got selected.</p>



<h5><strong><strong>Chandrayaan 1 was the first time India explored another world. What were the early stages of its conception like at ISRO?</strong></strong></h5>



<p>Dr. K. Kasturirangan, who chaired ISRO from 1994 to 2003, wanted the organization to play a small role in India’s ambition to become a superpower. This planted the seed for undertaking more ambitious missions. The idea of a Moon orbiter was floated around and was received positively by everyone.</p>



<p>At the time, ISRO already had satellites intended for geostationary applications which have plenty of fuel. So the basic infrastructure was ready and the only delta required was adapting it to the Moon. Initial calculations showed that our PSLV rocket was capable of giving an Earth-bound orbit beyond which the fuel on the spacecraft could be used to go to the Moon and perform orbital capture. In all, Chandrayaan 1 seemed like a logical extension of our capabilities.</p>



<h5><strong>What did your role as Chandrayaan 1’s Mission Director involve and what was your biggest challenge?</strong></h5>



<p>I was involved in all aspects of the Mission Design – the design of the various orbits, data management, orbit determination, strategies for mid-course corrections, etc. and also in aspects of operating the spacecraft.</p>



<p>Chandrayaan 1 was the first ISRO project to involve many foreigners who had their scientific instruments onboard. As Mission Director, I was tasked with accommodating their needs. It posed challenges because they had diverse requirements.</p>



<p>For instance, scientists behind the Mini-SAR payload wanted to calibrate the instrument when the spacecraft would be en-route to the Moon. They were unhappy with the fact that we couldn’t accommodate that due to certain changes in our launch schedule. However, at a later stage we provided them with a geometry in lunar orbit for calibration which they said was even better than what they originally asked for.</p>



<h5><strong>Was finding water on the Moon a primary scientific objective during the planning of Chandrayaan 1? Why was it important?</strong></h5>



<p>Absolutely. NASA missions to the Moon in the past decade had already hinted at the possibility of water ice being trapped in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon. So it was crucial to confirm its presence as it has implications for future human settlements as well as getting insights on <a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">the Moon’s origin</a>.</p>



<h5><strong>For Chandrayaan 1, ISRO solicited scientific instruments from other space agencies around the world. What was the driving philosophy behind that?</strong></h5>



<p>We had our own science payloads on Chandrayaan 1 but given the renewed global interest in the Moon after so many decades, we also wanted to provide the spacecraft as a platform for others. And so ISRO put out an announcement of opportunity to scientists all over the world to pitch payloads for Chandrayaan 1. We got instruments from ESA as well as NASA, including Universities associated with them. I think the timing of Chandrayaan 1 was good as NASA’s next Moon mapper, LRO, was still a year away.</p>



<h5><strong>Tell us about the <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">discovery of water</a> on the Moon by the NASA instruments onboard Chandrayaan 1 and more on the India-USA partnership.</strong></h5>



<p>As discussed, NASA scientists were really interested in putting their instruments on Chandrayaan 1 and working with us to confirm the presence of water. The discovery ultimately came from two NASA-built instruments – the Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) and the Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3).</p>



<p>Mini-SAR <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">found</a> that more than 40 craters on the lunar poles reflected signals in patterns consistent with water ice. However, there was still some uncertainty like in previous missions about the detections really being water ice.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/c2356-mini-sar-finds-water-ice.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Likely water ice on the Moon’s north pole (marked by green circles) found by Chandrayaan 1 instrument Mini-SAR. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It was the M3 instrument that <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">confirmed</a> water ice being present in the polar craters based on how the surface absorbed infrared light. In fact, M3 detected water and hydroxyl molecules almost everywhere on the Moon. Scientists now knew for the first time that the lunar soil does hold trace amounts of water even in the non-polar regions.</p>

<p>The India-USA partnership on Chandrayaan 1 also extended to NASA providing us access to its iconic Deep Space Network which was used for communications with the spacecraft.</p>



<h5><strong>What was the most challenging scenario when operating Chandrayaan 1 in lunar orbit?</strong></h5>



<p>Oh, this is my favorite part! Chandrayaan 1 actually managed to view a solar eclipse from the Moon! We were able to see the Moon’s shadow cast on Earth. In 2009, a year after launch, both the star sensors onboard the spacecraft had failed. With that, the spacecraft lost its ability to precisely point to a desired attitude in space. A mission failure was looming.</p>



<p>Instead of losing the craft, we came up with a solution that involved using the Sun sensors to get knowledge of two spatial axes and take aid from the ground station to know the third. This data was utilized by the onboard gyroscopes to be able to point the spacecraft again with reasonable accuracy. The mission was back up and running.</p>



<p>As the spacecraft passed between the Moon and Earth in its lunar orbit on July 22, 2009, it imaged the Moon’s shadow cast on our planet. This was a first for any lunar mission and completely executed when the spacecraft was in a non-nominal state.</p>

<h5><strong>Do you think there’s enough water on the Moon’s poles to power large human settlements in the future?</strong></h5>



<p>It’s too early to comment but going by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">amount estimated</a> from Chandrayaan 1 Mini-SAR observations, it seems there could be enough. Chandrayaan 2’s orbiter can tell us more details about it.</p>



<h5><strong>How is the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter positioned to provide us more insights on water on the Moon?</strong></h5>



<p>The Chandrayaan 2 orbiter has <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/chandrayaan2-payloads">upgraded instruments</a>. It’s infrared spectrometer will build a global, high-resolution map of water concentrations in the lunar soil and how the amount changes in response to the lunar environment.</p>



<p>The upgraded radar, that can penetrate deeper, will map the water ice trapped in the lunar poles and quantify its amount, something no one has adequately done yet.</p>



<h5><strong>How can India compete with China and the USA in the renewed Moon race?</strong></h5>



<p>It is difficult as both these nations have enormous resources. But the spectrum of science that can be done on the Moon is vast and our strategy has been to fill crucial gaps in our current understanding, like the discovery of water.</p>



<h5><strong>Which planetary destination do you think India should aim for next and why?</strong></h5>



<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus. It&nbsp;is mostly covered with fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies in the Solar System and is known to host water underneath that icy surface. After Cassini spacecraft’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/new-organic-compounds-found-in-enceladus-ice-grains">discovery of organic compounds</a> in Enceladus’ plumes, it has become, to me, by far the most interesting object in the Solar System.</p>



<h5><strong>What does having a planetary exploration program mean for a country like India?</strong></h5>



<p>It plays an important role in eventual settlement of space. Doing such missions means we gain new capabilities and experiences, all of which give us a good starting point for future endeavors. For instance, the most notable thing in Chandrayaan 2 is that all of its cutting-edge scientific instruments are designed and built indigenously.</p>



<h5><strong>What are your thoughts on India sending its own astronauts to space, aka the Gaganyaan program?</strong></h5>



<p>Sending humans to space involves too many challenges, like ruggedization of the spacecraft and launcher, having enough fuel at all stages, complex trajectories, multi-layered redundancy in spacecraft functions, etc. At every stage, there should be a means to get back humans safely and there is little to no tolerance for failure. With all those requirements, Gaganyaan is certainly a very expensive undertaking. But it has to be done sooner or later for space settlement, so why not now?</p>



<h5><strong>Throughout your career at ISRO, how have you seen the landscape for women in STEM change?</strong></h5>



<p>There are many <a href="https://jatan.space/book-review-those-magnificent-women-and-their-stories/">women at ISRO</a> who are capable and doing exceptional work. Over the years they have rightly assumed increasingly higher and more versatile positions inside ISRO’s various missions and centers. This includes women who aren’t necessarily photogenic and don’t feel the need to be in the limelight.</p>



<h5><strong>Should humanity establish permanent presence on the Moon first or Mars?</strong></h5>

<p>Ohhh, never thought of this hypothesis: that the act of getting
drunk together might be a social technology that helps us verify
the trustworthiness of others by inhibiting their higher cognitive
functions and thus making it harder to consciously fake things.
That would make sense.</p>
<p>&gt; To enhance our natural thin-slicing abilities, humans have
therefore also developed various cultural practices that make these
instant assessments more reliable. These techniques take advantage
of the fact that deception is fundamentally a cold-cognition act
and relies on cognitive control centers. This means that if we can
impair the cognitive control abilities of people we're trying to
judge, we’ll do a better job of sussing them out: they will
be less able to confuse our cheater-detection systems.</p>
<p>&gt; In one study that has proven enormously useful to law
enforcement agencies, researchers found that police officers could
significantly improve their ability to detect false statements if
suspects were asked to give their alibis in reverse order, starting
with the most recent event and working their way back. This is not
the way we normally tell stories, so being forced to do it
increases cognitive load. Dishonest suspects, it turns out, are
less effective liars if you handicap their conscious minds in this
way.</p>
<p>&gt; This reverse-order alibi technique is a great tool for law
enforcement but not terribly practical when evaluating a potential
business partner or deciding if the people you’re about to
make a peace treaty with are being sincere. There are other ways to
achieve the same effect, though. The police study aimed to reduce
subjects’ cognitive control ability by increasing the
load-adding more weight, as it were. Alternately, you can keep the
load constant but decrease cognitive control ability-weaken the
mental muscles-by suppressing cognitive control centers. One way to
do this is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves
applying a powerful magnetic force to the appropriate region of the
skull. TMS, however, is a very recent technology and not exactly
widely available. Also, in most cultures it’s considered bad
form to shock the heads of new acquaintances with huge magnets.</p>
<p>&gt; A much more low-tech and socially acceptable way to produce
the same effect is to get someone completely wasted. As we
discussed in chapter 6, one of the primary effects of alcohol and
other intoxicants is to "downregulate," or temporarily paralyze,
areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with cognitive control. A
couple shots of tequila is the liquid equivalent of a nice jolt of
TMS. It’s therefore no accident that intoxicants of various
sorts are frequently employed by human beings as social lubricants.
Alcohol, kava, cannabis, magic mushrooms, you name it: any
intoxicant that people can get their hands on quickly comes to play
a central role in social occasions, both formal and informal. In
ancient China, no major treaty was signed without first bringing
everyone together in an extended, alcohol-soaked banquet. In fact,
this is one feature of Chinese culture that has not changed a bit
in over four thousand years. Any modern businessperson hoping to
ink a deal with Chinese partners had better get his or her liver in
shape first.</p>
<p>&gt; On a less formal level, this is no doubt why intoxicants
are a universal feature of all sorts of human social gatherings,
from casual cocktail parties to fraternity mixers. Not only is
getting drunk pleasant, it also typically causes people to get
along more freely and easily (at least to a certain point, after
which the drunken fights break out). Intoxication enhances
cooperation in at least two ways. First of all, it reduces social
faking by inhibiting cognitive control centers. Second, if we all
get drunk together, we create a situation of mutual vulnerability
that makes trust easier to establish. Getting drunk is essentially
an act of mental disarmament. In the same way that shaking right
hands with someone assures them that you’re not holding a
weapon, downing a few tequila shots is like checking your
prefrontal cortex at the door. See? No cognitive control. You can
trust me.</p>
