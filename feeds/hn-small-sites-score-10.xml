November 4, 2020 | http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/posts/starbucks-singapore-account-takeover/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/posts/starbucks-singapore-account-takeover/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<h3 id="recon"><strong>Recon</strong></h3>
<p>While browsing Starbucks Singapore, I noticed a page loaded with content from a 3rd party site. Let’s call this site <em>example.com</em> in order not to disclose it. When I did some research on this site, I saw the same login page on <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> in the directory example.com/starbucks, and at this point I had two possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>This application can be an environment where current developments of <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> are made and tested.</li>
<li>Or it may have been used as an old test environment and is in an idle state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both possibilities increased the probability of a bug here, but the main problem is that I did not know whether a bug I will find here would affect the production environment. To understand this, I created a user account at card.starbucks.com.sg and tried to log into example.com/starbucks with this account. BINGO! I was able to successfully login with the account I just created. Both applications seemed to be using the same authentication mechanism.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/images/starbucks-1.png" alt="Scheme-1, both applications are using same database table."></p>
<h3 id="exploitation"><strong>Exploitation</strong></h3>
<p>From this point I browsed example.com/starbucks and discovered an endpoint which does not exist in the production app. The POST data this endpoint received was as follows.</p>
<p><code>email=hacker@hacker.com</code></p>
<p>When I write the email address of the account I want to takeover in the email parameter here and send a request, I saw the partial information of the account belonging to that email address on my profile page. I could not fully takeover the account yet, and my password change request was not successful due to the invalid CSRF token generated in this application.</p>
<p>To get around this, I copied the PHPSESSID cookie value from example.com/starbucks to card.starbucks.com.sg and BOOM! I was able to see all the information belongs to victim in the production environment, the valid CSRF tokens generated here allowed me to change the password and I was able to completely takeover an account whose e-mail address I know.</p>
<h3 id="impact"><strong>Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Except for seeing all personal information belonging to users and completely taking over the accounts, if there is a loaded credit in the user account, these credits can be spent in Starbucks stores via the mobile application.</p>
<h3 id="multiplying-the-reward"><strong>Multiplying the Reward</strong></h3>
<p>I came across two other test environments on example.com. Let’s call them <em>example.com/starbucks2</em> and <em>example.com/starbucks3</em>. With my account at card.starbucks.com.sg, I was not able to login to either test environment. example.com/starbucks2 did not allow me to create a new account, so I tried my luck at example.com/starbucks3 and successfully created a new account. Things get a little complicated here, I will try to explain it as simply as possible.</p>
<p>I think the applications example.com/starbucks2 and example.com/starbucks3 were using test tables, so users in production could not login in these applications.</p>
<p>With the account I created at example.com/starbucks3, I was able to log in to example.com/starbucks2, but not card.starbucks.com.sg. However, the PHPSESSID I copied from example.com/starbucks2 was valid on card.starbucks.com.sg and I could use that account. Considering all the scenarios, I created a chain here as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a dummy account with the victim’s email address at example.com/starbucks3. (Add to testusers table.)</li>
<li>At example.com/starbucks2, associate the account for that email with your own account via the same endpoint. (Associate the PHPSESSID with the email in the testusers table.)</li>
<li>Copy the PHPSESSID to card.starbucks.com.sg and takeover. (Takeover the real account of the same email address in the production users table.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Linux Commands Handbook follows the 80/20 rule: you’ll learn 80% of a topic in around 20% of the time you spend studying it.</p>
<p>I find that this approach gives you a well-rounded overview.</p>
<p>This handbook does not try to cover everything under the sun related to Linux and its commands. It focuses on the small core commands that you will use the 80% or 90% of the time, and tries to simplify the usage of the more complex ones.</p>
<p>All these commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL, and anywhere you have a UNIX environment.</p>
<p>I hope the contents of this handbook will help you achieve what you want: <strong>getting comfortable with Linux</strong>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://flaviocopes.com/page/linux-commands-handbook/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to download this handbook in PDF / ePUB / Mobi format</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<h2 id="introductiontolinuxandshells">Introduction to Linux and shells</h2>
<h3 id="whatislinux">What is Linux?</h3>
<p>Linux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.</p>
<p>It is also the most popular Open Source operating system, and it gives you a lot of freedom.</p>
<p>It powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It’s the base upon which everything is built. But not just that. Android is based on (a modified version of) Linux.</p>
<p>The Linux “core” (called a <em>kernel</em>) was born in 1991 in Finland, and it has come a really long way from its humble beginnings. It went on to be the kernel of the GNU Operating System, creating the duo GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>There’s one thing about Linux that corporations like Microsoft, Apple, and Google will never be able to offer: the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer.</p>
<p>They’re actually going in the opposite direction, building walled gardens, especially on the mobile side.</p>
<p>Linux is the ultimate freedom.</p>
<p>It is developed by volunteers, some paid by companies that rely on it, some independently. But there’s no single commercial company that can dictate what goes into Linux, or the project’s priorities.</p>
<p>You can also use Linux as your day to day computer. I use macOS because I really enjoy the applications and design (and I also used to be an iOS and Mac apps developer). But before using macOS I used Linux as my main computer Operating System.</p>
<p>No one can dictate which apps you can run, or “call home” with apps that track you, your position, and more.</p>
<p>Linux is also special because there’s not just “one Linux”, like is the case with Windows or macOS. Instead, we have <strong>distributions</strong>.</p>
<p>A “distro” is made by a company or organization and packages the Linux core with additional programs and tooling.</p>
<p>For example you have Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, probably the most popular distributions.</p>
<p>But many, many more exist. You can create your own distribution, too. But most likely you’ll use a popular one that has lots of users and a community of people around it. This lets you do what you need to do without losing too much time reinventing the wheel and figuring out answers to common problems.</p>
<p>Some desktop computers and laptops ship with Linux preinstalled. Or you can install it on your Windows-based computer, or on a Mac.</p>
<p>But you don’t need to disrupt your existing computer just to get an idea of how Linux works.</p>
<p>I don’t have a Linux computer.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, you just need to know that under the hood macOS is a UNIX Operating System. It shares a lot of the same ideas and software that a GNU/Linux system uses, because GNU/Linux is a free alternative to UNIX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNIX</a> is an umbrella term that groups many operating systems used in big corporations and institutions, starting from the 70’s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The macOS terminal gives you access to the same exact commands I’ll describe in the rest of this handbook.</p>
<p>Microsoft has an official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> which you can (and should!) install on Windows. This will give you the ability to run Linux in a very easy way on your PC.</p>
<p>But the vast majority of the time you will run a Linux computer in the cloud via a VPS (Virtual Private Server) like DigitalOcean.</p>
<h3 id="whatisashell">What is a shell?</h3>
<p>A shell is a command interpreter that exposes an interface to the user to work with the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users advanced features like being able to create scripts.</p>
<p>This is important: shells let you perform things in a more optimized way than a GUI (Graphical User Interface) could ever possibly let you do. Command line tools can offer many different configuration options without being too complex to use.</p>
<p>There are many different kind of shells. This post focuses on Unix shells, the ones that you will find commonly on Linux and macOS computers.</p>
<p>Many different kind of shells were created for those systems over time, and a few of them dominate the space: Bash, Csh, Zsh, Fish and many more!</p>
<p>All shells originate from the Bourne Shell, called <code>sh</code>. “Bourne” because its creator was Steve Bourne.</p>
<p>Bash means <em>Bourne-again shell</em>. <code>sh</code> was proprietary and not open source, and Bash was created in 1989 to create a free alternative for the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. Since projects had to pay to use the Bourne shell, Bash became very popular.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, try opening your Mac terminal. By default it runs ZSH (or, pre-Catalina, Bash).</p>
<p>You can set up your system to run any kind of shell – for example I use the Fish shell.</p>
<p>Each single shell has its own unique features and advanced usage, but they all share a common functionality: they can let you execute programs, and they can be programmed.</p>
<p>In the rest of this handbook we’ll see in detail the most common commands you will use.</p>

<h2 id="the-man-command">The <code>man</code> command</h2>
<p>The first command I’ll introduce will help you understand all the other commands.</p>
<p>Every time I don’t know how to use a command, I type <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code> to get the manual:</p>

<p>This is a man (from <em>_manual_</em>) page. Man pages are an essential tool to learn as a developer. They contain so much information that sometimes it’s almost too much.<br>The above screenshot is just 1 of 14 screens of explanation for the <code>ls</code> command.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I need to learn a command quickly I use this site called <strong>tldr pages</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://tldr.sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tldr.sh</a>. It’s a command you can install, which you then run like this: <code>tldr &lt;command&gt;</code>. It gives you a very quick overview of a command, with some handy examples of common usage scenarios:</p>

<p>This is not a substitute for <code>man</code>, but a handy tool to avoid losing yourself in the huge amount of information present in a <code>man</code> page. Then you can use the <code>man</code> page to explore all the different options and parameters you can use on a command.</p>
<h2 id="the-ls-command">The <code>ls</code> command</h2>

<p>Inside a folder you can list all the files that the folder contains using the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>ls
</code></pre>
<p>If you add a folder name or path, it will print that folder’s contents:</p>
<pre><code>ls /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><code>ls</code> accepts a lot of options. One of my favorite combinations is <code>-al</code>. Try it:</p>
<pre><code>ls -al /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Compared to the plain <code>ls</code> command, this returns much more information.</p>
<p>You have, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>the file permissions (and if your system supports ACLs, you get an ACL flag as well)</li>
<li>the number of links to that file</li>
<li>the owner of the file</li>
<li>the group of the file</li>
<li>the file size in bytes</li>
<li>the file’s last modified datetime</li>
<li>the file name</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of data is generated by the <code>l</code> option. The <code>a</code> option instead also shows the hidden files.</p>
<p>Hidden files are files that start with a dot (<code>.</code>).</p>

<h2 id="thecdcommand">The <code>cd</code> command</h2>
<p>Once you have a folder, you can move into it using the <code>cd</code> command. <code>cd</code> means <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory. You invoke it specifying a folder to move into. You can specify a folder name, or an entire path.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
cd fruits
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are in the <code>fruits</code> folder.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>..</code> special path to indicate the parent folder:</p>
<pre><code>cd .. #back to the home folder
</code></pre>
<p>The # character indicates the start of the comment, which lasts for the entire line after it’s found.</p>
<p>You can use it to form a path:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
mkdir cars
cd fruits
cd ../cars
</code></pre>
<p>There is another special path indicator which is <code>.</code>, and indicates the <strong>current</strong> folder.</p>
<p>You can also use absolute paths, which start from the root folder <code>/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cd /etc
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-pwd-command">The <code>pwd</code> command</h2>

<p>Whenever you feel lost in the filesystem, call the <code>pwd</code> command to know where you are:</p>
<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>
<p>It will print the current folder path.</p>

<h2 id="the-mkdir-command">The <code>mkdir</code> command</h2>

<p>You create folders using the <code>mkdir</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can create multiple folders with one command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir dogs cars
</code></pre>
<p>You can also create multiple nested folders by adding the <code>-p</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p fruits/apples
</code></pre>
<p>Options in UNIX commands commonly take this form. You add them right after the command name, and they change how the command behaves. You can often combine multiple options, too.</p>
<p>You can find which options a command supports by typing <code>man &lt;commandname&gt;</code>. Try now with <code>man mkdir</code> for example (press the <code>q</code> key to esc the man page). Man pages are the amazing built-in help for UNIX.</p>

<h2 id="the-rmdir-command">The <code>rmdir</code> command</h2>

<p>Just as you can create a folder using <code>mkdir</code>, you can delete a folder using <code>rmdir</code>:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
rmdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can also delete multiple folders at once:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits cars
rmdir fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>The folder you delete must be empty.</p>
<p>To delete folders with files in them, we’ll use the more generic <code>rm</code> command which deletes files and folders, using the <code>-rf</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful as this command does not ask for confirmation and it will immediately remove anything you ask it to remove.</p>
<p>There is no <strong>bin</strong> when removing files from the command line, and recovering lost files can be hard.</p>

<h2 id="the-mv-command">The <code>mv</code> command</h2>

<p>Once you have a file, you can move it around using the <code>mv</code> command. You specify the file current path, and its new path:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
mv pear new_pear
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pear</code> file is now moved to <code>new_pear</code>. This is how you <strong>rename</strong> files and folders.</p>
<p>If the last parameter is a folder, the file located at the first parameter path is going to be moved into that folder. In this case, you can specify a list of files and they will all be moved in the folder path identified by the last parameter:</p>
<pre><code>touch pear
touch apple
mkdir fruits
mv pear apple fruits #pear and apple moved to the fruits folder
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-cp-command">The <code>cp</code> command</h2>

<p>You can copy a file using the <code>cp</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
cp apple another_apple
</code></pre>
<p>To copy folders you need to add the <code>-r</code> option to …</p></div></div>

		<p>What do Microsoft <i>really</i> think about open-source?</p>

		<p><strong>Update</strong>: according to multiple online sources, the leaked source code was from GitHub <em>Enterprise</em>, not the version hosted at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>. While a substantial amount of code is shared between the two, they do have some differences.</p>
<p>The entirety of the confidential source code used by GitHub Enterprise has just been leaked to the public.</p>
<p>In a suspicious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104050026if_/https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/565ece486c7c1652754d7b6d2b5ed9cb4097f9d5">commit</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">official GitHub DMCA repository</a>, an unknown individual uploaded the confidential source code, impersonating Nat Friedman using a bug in GitHub's application.</p>
<p>At the heart of open-source, GitHub has long been criticised for keeping its source code private. The platform hosts millions of open-source projects, and critics say GitHub's position is somewhat hypocritical.</p>
<p>However, this raises questions around the security of GitHub's source code, and whether or not GitHub have anything to lose, if they do plan to release the source code in a public setting.</p>
<p>Some worry this will damage the overall security of GitHub, and this may be true. Commonly, closed-source applications perform "security by obscurity". This means the source code is hidden, with the intention of concealing security risks.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/17954714/microsoft-github-deal-acquisition-complete">acquisition of GitHub</a> in 2018, Microsoft have repeatedly emphasised their "love" for open-source. We have seen this through repeated commercial advertisements, which aim to place Microsoft at the forefront of open-source development.</p>
<p>Some users, such as Drew DeVault, suggest Microsoft is attempting to <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/27/Microsoft-plays-their-hand.html">centralise open-source</a>. Through closed-source applications, and proprietary extensions to Git, GitHub is seen as a platform that tries to <em>contain</em> open-source. An example of this is when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306674/github-down-errors-outage-june-2020">GitHub went offline for two hours</a>, leaving thousands of open-source projects inaccessible and unusable.</p>
<p>GitHub is, in many ways, the Google of open-source development.</p>
<p>Perhaps GitHub as 12 years late in finally revealing their source code to the public; and maybe this is just what we need. <a href="https://mastodon.tedomum.net/@resynth1943">What do you think?</a></p>

<div>


<p>So this is just going to be a total rant.
IPv6 is, in theory, a solution to many things, including the dwindling IPv4 address space.
IPv6 was a draft in 1997(!), and became a real <em>Internet Standard</em> in 2017.
And, quite frankly, it’s one of those things that just adds too much hassle for not enough benefit.</p>

<p>Okay, yes, IPv6’s address space is <em><strong>massive.</strong></em>
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for 4,294,967,296 total addresses.
IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, meaning… 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
The entire v4 space could fit into the v6 space $7.922816251426434 \times 10^{28}$ times over.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The default allocation to people, a <code>/64</code>, meaning the first half of the addresses is fixed and the entire second half is the part unique to the network, means that most people have 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 addresses to play with at home.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Compared to v4, where <em>most</em> networks are around <code>/24</code>, meaning the first three groupings are fixed, you get… 254 addresses.
Again, context, a standard <code>/64</code> allocation can, <em>again</em>, fit the entire v4 address space inside itself 4,294,967,296 times. (Yes, that’s the number of addresses <em>in</em> the IPv4 address space. That’s what happens when you divide a power by half of that power.)</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are, well, sparse, given that most high-level authorities have already run out of addresses, but because CIDR and NAT are a thing, we’ve really started compacting down our usage.
<em>My entire house</em> of easily over 60 IPs takes up… 2, according to the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id="allocation-issues">Allocation Issues</h2>
<p>One thing that people have criticized IPv4 for is that the allocations are just horrible.
For example, <em>anything</em> starting with <code>127</code> is <code>localhost</code>.
normally this is <code>127.0.0.1</code>, but anything from <code>127.0.0.0</code> to <code>127.255.255.255</code> all mean the <strong>exact same thing.</strong>
That’s 16,777,216 addresses all <em>literally for <code>localhost</code>.</em>
By numbers, 0.39% of the address space, but just keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, anything starting with a <code>0</code>, is effectively “current network” (only valid as source), again, another 16 million addresses.</p>
<p>There’s also multiple blocks for private networks, <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>, <code>172.16.0.0/12</code>, and <code>192.168.0.0/16</code>.
In total, 17,891,328 addresses.</p>
<p>Compared to IPv6, yes, IPv6 is much better… in theory.
There’s only <em>one</em> loopback address, <code>::1</code>.
At the same time… <code>fc00::/7</code> (26,58,455,991,569,831,745,807,614,120,560,689,152 addresses) is the private address space (more on that later), <code>fe80::/10</code> (332,306,998,946,228,968,225,951,765,070,086,144 addresses) is the <em>local</em> address space, and <code>ff00::/8</code> (1,329,227,995,784,915,872,903,807,060,280,344,576 addresses.) is multicast.
yes, do you see a recurring pattern?
Even though the entire “special” address assignments are exactly 1.271% of the entire IPv6 address space, we’re still allocating <strong>giant</strong> swathes of addresses.
History repeats itself, you can see that <em>right here.</em></p>
<p>And I will admit, that multicast in IPv6 is special since some bits in the address are special flags, and one form of multicast actually includes a response node’s address, so it’s not <em>just</em> an arbitrary number, but… come on, that’s a little uncalled for, having <em>that much</em> space.</p>

<p>We all know what an IPv4 address looks like, right?
Four dotted-decimal grouping in the range from 0–255.
For example, <code>192.168.5.225</code>.
IPv6 uses <em>eight</em> groupings of four <em>hex</em> digits, colon-separated.
For example, <code>2607:f0d0:1002:0051:0000:0000:0000:0004</code>.
That’s… very unweildy, so we have a few shortening rules.
Any zeros that <em>lead</em> the droup can be dropped, giving us this: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51:0:0:0:4</code>.
And since <em>that</em> is still repetitive, you can replace <em>exactly one</em> sequence of <em>more than one group</em> of all zeros with an empty: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code>.
For the record this is why the loopback address is <code>::1</code>.
The full address is <code>0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</code>.
Even with those methods, they’re still <em>much</em> longer, harder to remember, and harder to even say than IPv4 addresses.</p>
<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>And remember that this address violates the URL spec, since the <code>:</code> character is specifically to be used to separate the <em>host</em> portion (e.g., <code>google.com</code>) from the <em>port</em> to connect to (assuming nonstandard).
As an example, I can reach my torrent client via <code>http://192.168.5.43:9091</code>.
See that <code>:</code> there?
Because Transmission listens on port 9091, not port 80.
How do we fix this?
Well, by breaking it again, naturally.
To connect to a raw IPv6 address, you wrap it in square brackets.
To connect to <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code> directly, that’s <code>http://[2607:f0d0:1002:51::4]/</code>
<strong>Why is this a thing?!</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>okay, admittedly, IPv6 kinda relies on DNS since… just about everything uses DNS, and of course, actual names are more memorable than 32 hexadecimal digits, but DNS isn’t magic.
Unless you have your own DNS server (actually not that hard) that’s configured, you’re still manually typing addresses.
Of course if you have, say, pfSense managing your network, every static DHCP lease will be registered in DNS, but it has to take a DHCP lease.
And if this device doesn’t… well, I hope you don’t mind typing that out by hand to connect so you can configure it.</p>
<p>Even better, rDNS.
rDNS, or Reverse DNS, is where a DNS query is performed <em>with an IP address</em> that returns the hostname associated, in a <code>PTR</code> record.
For example, the IPv4 that <code>google.com</code> resolves to, <code>216.58.192.142</code>, can be queried as <code>142.192.58.216.in-addr.arpa</code> to get it’s “real” name, a <code>PTR</code> record for <code>ord36s01-in-f142.1e100.net</code>.
With <code>dig</code>, specifying a <code>-x</code> and then the IP will convert it to the correct format.
And if you look close, the query name is the IP, backwards, with <code>in-addr.arpa</code> at the front.
It’s backwards because of the hierarchical nature of DNS, which runs right to left, the opposite of IPs.
Of course, there’s also rDNS for IPv6:</p>

<p>One of the core pillars of IPv6 is that most of the processing of traffic should happen at the endpoints — routers don’t do much besides read, and forward, with very little actual data processing.
The IPv6 header while being <em>gargantuan</em> in comparison (because the giant addresses), is also much simpler.
A fixed version code (6), the traffic class (<abbr title="Differentiated Services">DiffServ</abbr>
+ <abbr title="Explicit Congestion Notification">ECN</abbr>
), a <em>flow label</em> which is effectively a random value that’s constant for every packet that’s part of the same logical connection, length, type of next header, and a TTL (then addresses, obviously).
That is <em>it</em>.
The IPv4 header contains 13 fields plus optional sections, and the IPv6 header contains a flat 8.
Of course, you may actually need other details, and that’s where the <em>next header</em> field comes in.
Instead of packing all sorts of options into the standard, global header, IPv6 uses additional header <em>extensions</em> that can get tacked on one after another to provide that information, say for fragmentation or IPsec.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
The value in the next header field identifies what’s going to come next, and the final header in the line will use this field to indicate the contained protocol, be it TCP, UDP, or something else.</p>
<p>Also note there’s no checksum anymore.
I mean, just about every device uses Ethernet, which has a Frame Check Sequence (FCS), UDP has a checksum option, TCP has a required checksum…
If we want to simply packet processing, drop the sum.
And really, it does make sense, in a way.
Even without that one, that means that most programs have two checksums: the Ethernet FCS as the frame gets transmitted point to point, and the transport layer checksum, making sure the entire packet is still valid.
Also, the IPv4 checksum also included the TTL (max number of hops in the path before the packet is dropped), meaning that at <em>every stop</em> along the way, the checksum had to be recalculated.</p>
<p>As a final point, this also does bring a change to another protocol: UDP.
With IPv4, the UDP checksum field can (and often would) be left blank as all zeros, meaning “no checksum”.
In IPv6, this is now disallowed, and a all zero checksum will still be checked… and then found invalid.
All UDP packets over IPv6 <em>must</em> have a valid checksum calculated.</p>

<p>So every link between devices has an MTU, the Maximum Transmission Unit.
For normal Ethernet links, minus the frame overhead, this is 1500 bytes.
If your equipment supports jumbo frames, that’s closer to 9000 bytes.
Well not all links are equal.
Some devices might have a high-MTU link on one end, and a lower MTU link on the other.
For example, my router might support jumbo frames internally, but the WAN side doesn’t allow that.
To deal with, this, we have <em>fragmentation</em>.</p>
<p>If a router is unable to forward a frame due to MTU differences, it will, if allowed, split the packet into multiple chunks, using the More Fragments flag and the Fragment Offset field of the IPv4 header, and send the packet in multiple frames piece by piece, which the other end can reassemble.
Note that I said “if allowed.”
There is a Don’t Fragment flag in the IPv4 header, and if this is set by the sending device, a router that cannot support a packet of that size will send back an <abbr title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</abbr>
“packet too big” message which bounces back along the chain.
Any node in the network path can perform this, meaning that for sending data, the only MTU you care about is the MTU of the device you’re directly connected …</p></div></article></div>

                <h3>Anatomy of a Binary Executable</h3>
                
                    <p><em></em>
                        <span>Wed, Nov 4, 2020</span>

            </div>

            <p>Even though I’ve developed software for a number of years now, there’s one question that has always been in the back of my mind and I haven’t had the time or patience to really answer, until now: <strong>What <em>is</em> a binary executable anyways?</strong></p>
<p>For this example, I wrote a brutally simple Rust program that includes a function “<code>sum</code>” to add two integers together, and am invoking it from <code>main()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, sum(<span>5</span>, <span>8</span>));
}

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span>(a: <span>i32</span>, b: <span>i32</span>) -&gt; <span>i32</span> {
    a <span>+</span> b
}
</code></pre></div><p>My Rust code is always structured the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html">“cargo way”</a>, so I can compile my program by running <code>cargo build</code>, and this will produce a binary for me within the <code>target/debug/</code> directory. I have named my crate <code>rbin</code>, so this is the name of the binary that is created at this location:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ cargo build
   Compiling rbin v0.1.0 <span>(</span>/home/mierdin/Code/rbin<span>)</span>

~$ ls -lha target/debug/rbin
-rwxrwxr-x <span>2</span> mierdin mierdin 3.1M Nov  <span>3</span> 22:46 target/debug/rbin
</code></pre></div><p>These days, it’s really easy to take such questions for granted, but if you’re curious, you may be asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But what <strong>is</strong> that file?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean we all generally know that it’s an “executable”, in that we run it and our program happens. But what does that mean? What is contained in that file that means our computer automatically just <strong>knows</strong> how to run it? And how is it possible that a program with 7 lines of code can take up over 3 megabytes of disk space?!?</p>
<p>It turns out that in order to create an executable for this ridiculously simple program, the Rust compiler must include quite a bit of additional software to make it possible.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out there is a widely accepted format for these things, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">“Executable and Linkable Format”</a>, or ELF!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that I won’t be comprehensively covering ELF here (there are plenty of other resources, many of which I’ll link to) - rather this is an exploration of what goes into a Rust binary with the simplest, default settings, and some observations about what seems interesting to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ELF is a well-known, popular format, especially in the world of Linux, but there are plenty of others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_executable_file_formats">Operating systems like Windows and macOS each have their own format</a>, which is a big reason why, when you’re compiling (or simply downloading) software, you have to specify the operating system you want to run it on. This is true despite the fact that the underlying machine code that executes your program may be the same on all of them (e.g. <code>x86_64</code>).</p>
<p>An <strong>exceptional</strong> visual breaking down the ELF format can be found at the link to the ELF wikipedia page above, I have found myself constantly referring back to it while writing this post:</p>
<p><a title="Ange Albertini / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0)" href="https://oswalt.dev/assets/2020/11/elf.png"><img width="512" alt="ELF Executable and Linkable Format diagram by Ange Albertini" src="https://oswalt.dev/assets/2020/11/elf.png"></a>
</p>
<p>Commonly, executable formats like this specify a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number">magic number</a> right at the beginning of the file, so that the format can be easily identified. This occupies the first four bytes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>. This is a very important field, because unless we can first identify an ELF file appropriately, we can’t reasonably expect to do anything “ELF-y” with it. We know where certain bits of information <strong>should</strong> be in an ELF file, but we first must identify using these bytes that this is what we can expect.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility is extremely useful for printing all kinds of useful metadata and related tables of information contained within an ELF file. However, this utility expects - naturally - that the file being read is actually an ELF file, and even provides a helpful hint that the expected “magic bytes” for a non-ELF file aren’t set appropriately when used on a non-ELF file, so it doesn’t attempt to read the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l .gitignore

readelf: Error: Not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start
</code></pre></div><p>Once identified, the entire rest of the file can be identified using <strong>byte offsets</strong> (that is, the number of bytes from zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those that are accustomed to looking at network packet captures, this should all sound very familiar to you, as this is exactly how we know where certain fields are located in a packet header. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet frames</a> have a predictable preamble and start-of-frame delimiter. Ethernet also has a field called the “Ethertype”, which provides a clue as to what protocol is contained within the Ethernet frame (which allows computers to then parse those field as well). Just like Ethernet has a standard set of byte offsets that indicate where the various fields should be represented, the ELF format specifies its own offsets for all of the fields providing useful identifying and execution information in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>, which then point to other important locations within the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s all kinds of useful information in this header, but in particular, the <code>e_entry</code> field  in the file header points to the offset location from where the execution should start. This is the “entry point” for the program. We’ll definitely be following this down the rabbit hole in a little bit.</p>
<p>We can again use <code>readelf</code>, this time on a proper ELF file (our Rust program), and also using the <code>-h</code> flag to show the file header:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -h target/debug/rbin

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#Program_header">program header table</a> contains information that allows the operating system to allocate memory and load the program. This is also referred to as a <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/psimage.html">process image</a>. You can think of it as a list of “instructions” that tell the system to do various things with chunks of memory in order to prepare to execute this program.</p>

Most of the participants showed improvement, and half achieved remission at the four-week follow-up.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin" target="_blank">Psilocybin</a> is a compound found in so-called “magic mushrooms.” It produces visual and auditory hallucinations, and profound changes in consciousness, over a period of several hours.</p><p>The findings appeared on November 4 in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JAMA Psychiatry</a></em>.</p><h2>Effect of psilocybin 4x stronger than traditional antidepressants</h2><p>“The magnitude of the effect we saw was about four times larger than what clinical trials have shown for traditional antidepressants on the market,” said co-author <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/davis">Alan Davis</a> of Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>As the paper explains, “the effect sizes reported in this study were approximately 2.5 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychotherapy, and more than 4 times greater than the effect sizes found in psycho-pharmacological depression treatment studies.”</p><p>“Because most other depression treatments take weeks or months to work and may have undesirable effects, this could be a game changer if these findings hold up” in future clinical trials, Davis said.</p><p>And compared to traditional antidepressants, the side effects of psilocybin are more limited. These include mild-to-moderate headaches, and “challenging emotions” during the sessions. Antidepressant medications, on the other hand, have more far-reaching side effects. These include <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/new-study-finds-ethnic-variation-in-suicide-method-guns-vs-hanging/">suicidal</a> ideation, decrease in sexual drive, and weight gain.</p><p>Furthermore, the effectiveness of psilocybin <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/effects-of-therapy-for-hypochondriacs-last-10-years-or-more/">therapy</a> appears after only one or two administrations. This represents another advantage over commonly used antidepressants, which typically require daily administration.</p><h2>Two five-hour psilocybin sessions</h2><p>For the new study, the researchers recruited 24 people with a long-term history of depression. Most of the participants had experienced symptoms for about two years before enrolling in the study.</p><p>The participants underwent two five-hour psilocybin sessions, under the supervision of the researchers.</p><p>The average age of participants was 39. Sixteen were women. Twenty-two identified as white, one identified as Asian, and one identified as African American.</p><p>Participants had to taper off any antidepressants prior to the study. They did so with the help of their personal physician, to ensure safe exposure to this experimental treatment.</p><p>Treatment consisted of two psilocybin doses given by two monitors who provided guidance and reassurance. The doses were given two weeks apart, between August 2017 and April 2019. Each treatment session lasted about five hours. The participants lay on a couch wearing eyeshades and headphones that played music, in the presence of the monitors.</p><h2>A very large reduction in depressive symptoms</h2><p>All participants completed the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408526/" target="_blank">GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</a> upon enrollment. They also did this same assessment at one and four weeks following completion of their treatment.</p><p>A score of 24 or more indicates severe depression. A score of 17-23 means moderate depression, 8-16 mild depression, and 7 or less no depression.</p><p>At enrollment, participants had an average depression scale rating of 23. But at one week and four weeks after treatment, they had an average depression scale score of 8.</p><p>After treatment, most participants showed a substantial decrease in their symptoms. Likewise, almost half were in remission from depression at the four-week follow-up.</p><p>For the entire group of 24 participants, 67% showed a more than 50% reduction in depression symptoms at the one-week follow-up, and 71% at the four-week follow-up. Overall, four weeks post-treatment, 54% of participants were considered in remission, meaning they no longer qualified as being depressed.</p><p>Compared to ketamine, another psychoactive substance that has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25038867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently been found</a> to alleviate depression, psilocybin has several advantages. The antidepressant effects of psilocybin seem to last longer. Psilocybin also has a lower potential for addiction and adverse events than ketamine.</p><h2>More results to follow</h2><p>The researchers say they will follow the participants for a year after the study to see how long the antidepressant effects of the psilocybin treatment last. They will report these new findings in a later publication.</p><p>In 2016, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers first reported that treatment with psilocybin under psychologically supported conditions significantly relieved existential anxiety and depression in people with a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hallucinogenic_drug_psilocybin_eases_existential_anxiety_in_people_with_life_threatening_cancer_" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-threatening cancer diagnosis</a>.</p><p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 17 million people in the U.S., and 300 million people worldwide, have experienced major <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/category/mental-health/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>.</p><p>Entrepreneur and philanthropist <a href="https://tim.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Ferriss</a> supported the funding campaign for this study. “I believe this study to be a critically important proof of concept for the medical approval of psilocybin for treatment of depression, a condition I have personally struggled with for decades,” he said.</p><p>“How do we explain the incredible magnitude and durability of effects? Treatment research with moderate to high doses of psychedelics may uncover entirely new paradigms for understanding and improving mood and mind,” Ferriss said.</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3285?guestAccessKey=29ac3052-6203-4fb4-b1e2-d9dda5988445&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=110420" target="_blank">Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan K.

You can enjoy this without reading the previous posts.</em></p><p>With the election in the state it is, I'm going to stop pretending that I can do work right now. So instead, I'll just milk the success of my last <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">two</a> <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">posts</a> and hope that none of you are really working right now either.</p><p>As discussed in the two <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">previous</a> <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">posts</a>, Dark is moving to F#. This has been a bit of a surprise to people, including me. We've spoken for years about the inevitable Rust rewrite; we have a CLI written in Rust and two services, so I was pretty sure that it was going to be Rust.</p><p>People asked about a few other languages as well, so let's get them out of the way first.</p><h3 id="clojure">Clojure</h3><p>I have a lot of experience with Clojure, as CircleCI was almost all Clojure. However, we spent a whole lot of time with dealing accidental complexity, specifically "what type is this field" and nulls all over the place. So I deliberately chose not to have a dynamically typed language, even though Clojure is a lovely language. A side benefit is to escape the Cult of Rich in the Clojure community. Hearing his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug">Maybe Not</a> talk really cemented for me how deep down the dynamically typed rabbit hole they are over there, and how much I disagree with that.</p><h3 id="haskell">Haskell</h3><p>I had previously tried to love Haskell, trying to <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/rash">write an interpreter</a> in it while I was at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, and I did not like it. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24978238">HN user momentumtop's explanation</a> match my feelings exactly:</p><blockquote>The Haskell community, in my experience, is far more academic. A<a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2020-September/030789.html"> recent post to the Haskell libraries mailing list</a> began with:<p>"It was pointed out to me in a private communication that the tuple function \x-&gt;(x,x) is actually a special case of a diagonalization for biapplicative and some related structures monadicially.</p><p>It received 39 pretty enthusiast replies.</p></blockquote><h3 id="scala">Scala</h3><p>I have no experience with Scala, but my overwhelming sense of the language and the community is that the whole thing is a mess. So I didn't consider it, and still wouldn't.</p><p>I actually <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">wrote quite a bit on why I didn't like Rust</a> a few weeks ago. I think those main reasons stand, so I'll just link to them rather than repeat the <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">1800 words</a> again. As a quick summary, the good parts were:</p><ul><li>tooling is great</li><li>library ecosystem is great</li><li>community is great</li><li>macros are nice (though I feel I was overusing them to cover problems in the language)</li></ul><p>and the bad parts were</p><ul><li>having to do memory management sucks</li><li>pattern matching doesn't work all that well</li><li>too many ways to do things (Arc vs Rc, async vs sync, different stdlibs)</li><li>the language isn't immutable</li><li>having to fight the compiler</li></ul><p>Again, for more on those, have a <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">read of the previous post</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, when it came time to decide, it came down to a few major things: missing a GCP library, and the low-level nature of the language.</p><h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2><p>Rust has a ton of libraries, and they work really well and are nicely integrated. They have 3rdparty libraries for <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>, <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>, and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/rollbar.com">Rollbar</a>, which are important services for us. However, the <a href="https://github.com/Byron/google-apis-rs">library for GCP</a> seems super sketch. It's autogenerated and the issues imply that they've gone as far as they can using this technique. So that seemed very risky to take on, given that the whole point was to have a much richer library ecosystem.</p><h2 id="async">Async</h2><p>When I wrote the <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">previous post</a>, I had just gotten the <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/tree/main/rust-hyper">synchronous version</a> of the benchmark to work in Rust. Then I tried to <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/tree/main/rust-hyper-async/execution-engine">make it async</a>. I really struggled with making things async. Apparently, recursion adds <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/07_workarounds/04_recursion.html">a new level of complexity</a> to async. But the thing that killed me was <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/04_pinning/01_chapter.html">pinning</a>.</p><p>Let's see if I can explain this. When you're writing an async, multi-threaded server in using the tokio runtime, async processes can be moved between threads. This means the memory can be copied, and so you need to ... pin things? OK, that's as much as I remember. Look in the HN comments after I publish this and I'm sure someone will explain better. The code <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/blob/main/rust-hyper-async/execution-engine/src/eval.rs">is over here</a> if you're interested.</p><p>I tried to get my head around this for some time, before deciding that this was a waste of time. Apparently, this boxing and pinning is what you get when you don't have a GC, and that when you do have a GC, you simply don't need to deal with it. So that was the final straw for me.</p><h2 id="rust-is-a-low-level-language">Rust is a low-level language</h2><p>I'm implementing a language that's basically F#/OCaml. So it makes sense that it's easier to implement in F#/OCaml. A few people pointed out that I'm trying to write OCaml in Rust, and that's not really what it was designed for. I think that's right. Rust's semantics makes many things easy, but not what I'm trying to do.</p><p>I think most of us don't need Rust. I think Rust is a wonderful community, ecosystem, and tooling, wrapping a language that nicely solves a problem very few of us have. It's just so nice over there, until you actually write code.</p><p>It's easy to forget, given how nice everything is with the error messages and the docs, that Rust is a very low-level language. We're so attracted to the community and the tooling that we forget that low-level languages suck. Maybe Rust has a better story than most low-level languages, but remember that garbage collectors are great. By having a GC, we don't have to do any of the stuff that causes all these problems in Rust. Maybe that costs performance, but I need the ability to quickly write code a lot more than I need the extra performance.</p><p>And ultimately, that's <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">why I picked F#</a>.</p><hr><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>You can sign up for Dark </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><a href="https://darklang.com/signup" rel="noopener nofollow"><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>here</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></a><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.

<p>If you are a startup founder or a product manager thinking of what to do next with your product, which features to implement first and how to better understand your target audiences needs, you are reading the correct article.</p>
<p>Today I am going to write about why we made Juphy's product roadmap public and how it helped us to better understand our customers needs in the most efficient way. </p>
<h2 id="what-s-a-public-product-roadmap-and-how-can-you-use-it-">What's a Public Product Roadmap and How Can You Use It?</h2>
<p>A public product roadmap is an easily accessible online page where your potential users, customers, team, investors and other stakeholders can view your roadmap, give feedback and decide on the future of your product. </p>
<p>Nine months ago we started using Canny for Juphy's public roadmap and we highly recommend it. Our users can request new features, upvote other feature requests, report bugs, follow Juphy's product roadmap and progress on Canny. This helps us to prioritize feature requests, track user feedback in a very organized manner, keep customers up to date on new improvements and make better product decisions by understanding the needs of our customers. Today we are very proud to publicly share our roadmap as well as why we recommend it to other startups. </p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-having-a-public-product-roadmap">Advantages of Having a Public Product Roadmap</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.juphy.com/nn_themes/juphy/img/posts/benefits-of-public-product-roadmap.png" alt="benefits-of-public-product-roadmap"></p>
<h3 id="1-better-understanding-of-customers-needs">1. Better Understanding of Customers Needs</h3>
<p>The first and the most important reason of why we have a public roadmap is to better understand our customers needs and develop a product that they can not live without. Having a public roadmap is a perfect way to get feedback from your users about what's most important to them in your product/service and it allows you to be more certain in your decision making. When your roadmap is public and open to feedback, product managers and founders have to spend less time doing market research to figure out what your potential users want. Rather, they can collect feedback through a platform like Canny and eventually have more time to focus on actually building the product. This will also help them to leave aside biases and gut feelings when making product decisions.  </p>
<h3 id="2-transparency-builds-trust">2. Transparency Builds Trust</h3>
<p>A significant reason to make your product roadmap public is to increase transparency between your company and customers. When users can contribute on your roadmap, they are showing a level of dedication to your product. It creates a community where customers are actively contributing to the future of your product by creating new feature requests and upvoting already existing requests. After all, they are able to track your teams progress and will know that their feedback is heard and respected by your organization. That alone builds trust and dedication to your company. </p>
<h3 id="3-manages-expectations">3. Manages Expectations</h3>
<p>When users can view your product roadmap, they can see what your current priorities are and get a sense of your goals. Canny's feature voting enables you to set expectations for which features are coming as much as which isn't. Your public roadmap will also manage expectations in several other ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>If a current customer sees active work on a feature they really want, it will reduce your churn rate as the customer will most probably wait for that feature to be live.</li>
<li>Similarly, a public roadmap can serve as a sales tool for potential customers as your sales team will be able to show that you are currently working on features that they need.</li>
<li>Or on the opposite side, if a feature request has a very limited number of votes, users can better understand why you haven't implemented their feedback. This prevents your users from being disappointed if their feature request is not put into action.</li>
<li>Finally, if you update your roadmap regularly, customers can easily see your progress on a certain feature and won't reach out to you to ask about progress. This will save you time and money in terms of customer support.</li>
<li>Most importantly, users will appreciate and value the fact that you’re continually working to improve based on their needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.juphy.com/nn_themes/juphy/img/posts/public-roadmap-voting.png" alt="public-roadmap-voting"></p>
<h3 id="4-improves-internal-communication">4. Improves Internal Communication</h3>
<p>Lastly, having a public roadmap gives all your employees a clear direction of your product which prevents uncertainty and improves motivation. It especially allows non-customer facing employees such as engineers to build a connection and better understand customers. They are able to gain direct insight into what customers are looking for, and prioritize their work based on the upvotes on your public roadmap. </p>
<p>On the recruitment side, candidates can view the product roadmap in advance and come in with very specific knowledge about the product, the company direction and what type of capabilities are required for this job. This allows you to ask more targeted questions about their skills and gives them a real idea about what kinds of projects they will be contributing to. Overall, the hiring process will be far more efficient. </p>
<p>On the support side, your team can instantly share your roadmap with customers, prospects and other stakeholders without asking for what's happening, which features are going to be added, etc. which will enable a more informative and rapid sales process.</p>
<h3 id="competitors-can-see-your-roadmap">Competitors Can See Your Roadmap</h3>
<p>While considering to make your product roadmap public, the first disadvantage that comes to mind is the fact that competitors will get a clear idea of your products direction. However, we believe that the advantages of having a public roadmap outweigh the disadvantages, and focusing on competition is a distraction. It is always a better idea to stay focused on your customers needs and execute your roadmap to the best of your ability. In the meantime, as Bri from Canny says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If competitors are looking to your roadmap for inspiration, that means they’re leaning on your customer base to tell them what to build—not their own. At the end of the day, this will hurt them, not you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We totally agree with her and we couldn't be more happier to use Canny.</p>
<p>Overall, we believe that having a public product roadmap is a great way to better understand our customers needs while creating a highly valuable community and making more confident product decisions for Juphy. We definitely recommend other startups to consider this option and we would like to take this opportunity to thank Canny's co-founders Sarah and Andrew for creating such a great product. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In this post I will explore the idea that because running code contributes to global warming, writing inefficient code is morally wrong<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I will start by outlining the argument, before working through each of the premises in turn to see how they hold up. I will then conclude that even if we cannot concretely defend every premise in this first iteration, then it is sufficiently plausible that it should at least make us pause for thought. With that said, let’s dive in!</p><p>The argument I am considering, in summary, can be presented as:</p><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li><li>Therefore, increasing your consumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol><p>I believe the argument as laid out above is valid, in that the conclusions follow from the premises, so we will focus our energies on determining if it is sound, that is all the premises are true. We will now break it down and look at each premise more carefully.</p><blockquote><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The first premise is based on the fact that running code requires electricity. Electricy, in large, requires the burning of fossil fuels, which releases a number of greenhouse gasses. There are cases where this is not the case (solar energy, wind energy), and in such cases, this argument is invalid. However, if you run your code on AWS, then it is very likely that you are running on fossil fuels<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. As AWS is the largest provider of cloud computing, this is likely to be true in a good number of cases.</p><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>With regards to the second and third premises, these are statements which are consistent with the overwhelming scientific consensus, and as such are uncontroversial. For the sake of completeness, here are some supporting statements from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf">2014 climate change report summary</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emphasis mine.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history</strong>. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia</strong>. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems</strong>. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems.</strong> Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development.</p></blockquote><p>I believe these to be enough to support the argument that greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, and that global warming will increase suffering of the human and other animal populations.</p><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>Therefore, increasing your consiumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>So here we come to our first conclusion, that increasing ones consumption of computing resources increases ones contribution to the suffering of others. It is based on at least two implicit premises. The first is that if A contributes to B, and B causes C, A contributes to C. The second is that in such a transitive relationship, if you increase your contribution to A then you increase your contribution to C. To illustrate, we can imagine a much more straightforward case. Imagine that I have a dial which, when turned, increases the voltage supplied to an electric chair. There are several such dials, and their contributions are additive. It would be fair to say that if I turned up my dial, I am contributing to the suffering of whoever is in that electric chair.</p><p>Given this assertion, it would seem reasonable that if running code produces greenhouse gasses, and greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, then running code contributes to global warming. Global warming increases the suffering of others, so it follows that running code increases ones contribution to the suffering of others.</p><blockquote><ol start="5"><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Premise five seems relatively uncontroversial, though to simplify let us just consider the length of time some piece of code takes to run (in a similar way we assess algorithmic complexity). If an efficient version runs in 1 minute, and an inefficient version runs in 1 hour, it stands to reason that the inefficient version would consume more electricity.</p><blockquote><ol start="6"><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others</li></ol></blockquote><p>With point six we again come to a relatively straightforward conclusion. If you agree with the earlier conclusion at point four and the premise at point five, then this falls out as a result of the logic of the statements.</p><blockquote><ol start="7"><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Point seven is the real crux of the argument, and on the surface intuitively plausible. In the above example with the dial, it would generally be considered morally wrong for you to dial up the dial and increase the suffering of the individual in the chair. However, if we are merely counting <em>contributions</em> to suffering, this casts a wide net. Would it be morally wrong not to buy an energy efficient bulb when an energy efficient one is available at the same price? How about breathing? This expels carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, but would generally not be considered a morally reprehensible action.</p><p>It seems that there is some inherent provision that increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is not morally wrong if it causes equal or greater personal suffering. For example, if there was some shared well of water, it would be reasonable to claim that it is not morally wrong of you to take a sip of water in order to save yourself from dehydration, even if that means other may become more dehydrated. However, if you drained the well, and threw that water away, causing another to die to dehydration, that seems morally wrong.</p><p>I think for the purposes of this post, we can consider this sufficiently true (there is definitely some sense in which it is true), even if is vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> in it’s current form. Consider it the alpha version of the premise - solid enough to be useful, but not without it’s bugs.</p><blockquote><ol start="8"><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Here we come to the conclusion of the argument, that writing inefficient code is morally wrong, which follows from the logic set out in the conclusion at point six and the premise at point seven. So what does this mean?</p><p>As discussed, I am aware that this argument is probably not watertight, and perhaps with some more time spent on it we could tighten it up<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. I think the premise at point seven could definitely be better defended, and there almost certainly some implicit premises and caveats that need to be put in place. However, I think it is reasonable enough that it should make us pause and reflect. Whilst a lot of code performance issues can be covered up with bigger and better hardware, these come at a greater cost than just an increased AWS bill. The decisions we make as developers have real world effects.</p><p>If there are ways that we can reduce ‘programming waste’ we should strive to do so, whether that is changing an algorithm to be <code>O(1)</code>, scaling down some cloud instances or killing of that Heroku dyno that’s not really doing anything useful<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Collectively we can make a real difference.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>I have had this idea knocking around for a while, but reading <a href="https://visitmy.website/2020/07/13/this-website-is-killing-the-planet/">this post</a> motivated me to explore it further.

<p><strong>Uncanny Vulvas- Diana Fleischman</strong></p>



<p>Sex is consistently underrated as a driver of innovation. Yes, space exploration helped us develop the technology for things like cochlear implants, powdered (machine) lubricants and scratch resistant lenses. Lust has furthered the development of cash transfers, point-of-view filming and video chat. I predict that historians of the development of artificial intelligence are going to see sexual gratification as one of the phenomenon’s great motivators. Evolutionary psychology can give us insight into how sex robots are going to develop and the ramifications they’ll have on society.</p>



<p>Sexbots are usually woman-shaped&nbsp;<em>gynoid</em>&nbsp;machines. At the&nbsp;present time,&nbsp;sex robots are simple: they’re silicone sex dolls that have some capacity for movement and response. Manufacturers are rolling out new models and new promises: sex robots that respond to touch and penetration, sex robots with interchangeable faces and bodies and sex robots with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/opinion/sex-robots-consent.html" target="_blank">different personalities</a>. Future robots will have the allure and cues of fertility of a flesh-and-blood woman combined with the artificial intelligence that creates compulsive reward directed behavior. An intelligence, unlike the intelligence of humans, that will have the gratification of its owner as the only goal. </p>



<p>Sex robots are overwhelmingly gynoid because heterosexual men drive the market for sexual products like prostitution and pornography. Across cultures, men desire more sexual partners, need to know someone for less time before they want to have sex with them, and have lower standards for a sexual liaison than women. Looking at gay men is instructive here. Their sexual interactions are not limited by women’s sexual choosiness and they, on average, have many more sexual partners than straight men or lesbians.</p>

<p>It isn’t hard to see the reason for this. Men don’t get pregnant and don’t lactate, and they have smaller, easier-to-produce sex cells than women.&nbsp;For a man, the cost of producing offspring is cheap. Getting one’s genes into the next generation is the engine of evolution. The low opportunity costs make men motivated to take every opportunity, even if it comes in the form of a robot. Ever think a dog is dumb for growling at his reflection in the mirror? Human men can become aroused looking at flat images of nude women in black and white,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_mismatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our evolved psychology can respond in maladaptive ways towards novel stimuli.</a></p>



<p>Courtship is expensive and complicated by design,&nbsp;and it’s the limiting factor&nbsp;of the sexual fulfillment of men.&nbsp;Women impose costs on men to gain sexual access for very good reasons: to test their genetic fitness and their long-term potential supporting a&nbsp;family. If courtship is costly and the costs are not clearly defined, this not only tests a man’s motivation toward a specific woman, it also acts to monopolize a man’s resources so he can’t afford to woo anyone else. Pornography and prostitution are popular because they arrive at sexual end goals, or a reasonable facsimile, with more clarity and lower costs than in the mating market.</p>



<p>The complications of courtship are driving improvements in sexual substitutes, like masturbation aids (e.g. fleshlight, fliphole) and 3-D&nbsp;porn. There are already thousands of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealDoll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RealDolls </a>in the world, silicone sex dolls that cost around $6,000 each.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LovePlus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>LovePlus</em>&nbsp;</a>is a Japanese game in which players interact with a virtual girlfriend including kissing her by touching the screen and taking her out on dates, has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/video-game-girlfriend-loveplus-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of thousands of users</a>.&nbsp;<em>LovePlus</em>&nbsp;is a great demonstration of how this market&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/05/love-plus-makes-you-care-about-a-virtual-girl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t only about providing sex</a>, but also virtual companionship. You can’t even have virtual sex with Rinko, the ingénue of the game. These substitutes aren’t very good, and yet they are already competing with flesh-and-blood companionship.</p>

<p>Union&nbsp;power, increases in mandatory working standards, and minimum wage&nbsp;laws&nbsp;accelerate the push toward&nbsp;automation.&nbsp;Machines&nbsp;are already replacing cashiers&nbsp;and&nbsp;factory workers. Soon the jobs of truck drivers, clerks, and accountants&nbsp;will be automated. The current political climate around courtship and interactions between the sexes is more powerful than&nbsp;the&nbsp;market forces that are&nbsp;replacing jobs,&nbsp;because escalating costs aren’t transparent and neither is the punishment for not paying them. If a business owner wants to adhere to employment laws, he reads them. The costs of courtship are codified nowhere.</p>



<p>The average single man paying attention to&nbsp;contemporary&nbsp;social fashions&nbsp;will struggle to understand the new rules of meeting, courting, or having sex with women. Something as banal as trying to converse with a woman wearing headphones&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.askmen.com/news/dating/talking-to-women-who-are-wearing-headphones.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is now often considered harassment</a>. A man’s chances of mating success increase when he approaches many women, but so too do his chances of a gaining reputation as sexist, exploitative, or immoral. To take a fraught example, how does a man know that a woman is genuinely consenting to sex?&nbsp;A lack of ability to pick up on cues can incur catastrophic costs.</p>



<p>Men high in conscientiousness, who are sensitive to social disapproval but who nonetheless have difficulty reading subtle social cues, could make good husbands for women.&nbsp;These men are unlikely to want to take the risk of approaching women. As substitutes like sex robots and virtual companions become better and cheaper,&nbsp;they will monopolize the attention of such men.</p>



<p>Think of an introverted engineer with Asperger’s syndrome who wasn’t sure how to broach a conversation with a woman back in 2015 and definitely isn’t sure how to&nbsp;do that in today’s climate. In 10 years he could have a beautiful robot companion (indeed, he could have one that could emulate the experience of having sex with dozens of&nbsp;different&nbsp;women) that has a lower barrier to entry than the mating market and that keeps him satisfied enough to&nbsp;remain a&nbsp;happy&nbsp;bachelor. Some woman misses out on a conscientious guy with a good income who might not know exactly how to respond when she says “nothing’s wrong,” but will definitely keep the cars tuned up to get the kids to their mathematics championships. The world might miss out on his sons and daughters and their analytical approaches to some of the world’s problems.</p>



<p>The kinds of men described above, who have difficulty reading social signals but who are nonetheless strongly sexually motivated, have a characteristic that means&nbsp;they’ll be less put off by sex robots than the average person: resistance to perceiving the uncanny valley. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The uncanny valley</a>” is the way that representations that fall just short of looking like humans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strangerdimensions.com/2013/11/25/10-creepy-examples-uncanny-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often look “creepy.”</a>&nbsp;Anthropomorphized robots are more relatable and trustworthy than machine-like robots. It’s also difficult to imagine that many people would want to have sex with a conglomeration of gears and wheels.</p>



<p>My view is that&nbsp;the uncanny valley&nbsp;is something analogous to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capgras delusion</a>,&nbsp;a psychological disorder that causes sufferers to believe that someone&nbsp;they&nbsp;know has been taken over by an imposter,&nbsp;often inhuman. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/vilayanur_ramachandran_on_your_mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VS Ramachandran</a>, there are two aspects to recognizing faces: the identification of the external familiar representation and the “internal” validation – the warm emotion that goes along with it. In the uncanny valley, you recognize a robot as humanlike, but it’s missing the facial movement or some other characteristic that gives you a warm feeling of recognition. Many men won’t experience the uncanny valley, especially with regards to sex robots. These men are going to be the early adopters. Men are worse at identifying faces than women and are far more likely to have&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prosopagnosia</a>, the inability to recognize faces.</p>



<p>Sex is weird.&nbsp;Sex is&nbsp;gross&nbsp;and awkward.&nbsp;Natural selection addressed this issue by causing arousal to attenuate the&nbsp;human&nbsp;disgust response. It’s worth noting that men have&nbsp;a&nbsp;much lower&nbsp;baseline&nbsp;sexual disgust than women,&nbsp;and that sexual excitement&nbsp;further reduces&nbsp;disgust sensitivity in men.&nbsp;In a&nbsp;<a href="http://people.duke.edu/~dandan/webfiles/PapersPI/Sexual%20Arousal%20and%20Decision%20making.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">classic paper</a>&nbsp;by Dan Ariely,&nbsp;aroused men&nbsp;had much more positive attitudes about all kinds of unusual sexual acts.&nbsp;Sexually aroused men were&nbsp;more likely to say&nbsp;that it would be fun to watch a woman urinating or that they could imagine getting sexually excited by contact with an animal). 3-D pornography of video game or cartoon characters that might be creepy in a nonsexual context are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/daily-glixel-people-were-thirsty-for-overwatch-zelda-porn-in-2017-w515316/the-top-video-game-porn-searches-of-2017-w515317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular genres</a>. The most direct evidence that men won’t be put off by uncanny vulvas is from a&nbsp;<a href="http://faculty.utrgv.edu/zhixiang.chen/cs6174/papers/Strait_paper2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&nbsp;that laments the “unabashed sexualization of female-gendered robots” in comments on YouTube&nbsp;videos of&nbsp;robots.&nbsp;Bawdy comments&nbsp;on gynoids&nbsp;– “you’ll have to replace it monthly due to semen corrosion,”&nbsp;for example&nbsp;– were more frequent than comments expressing unease.</p>



<p>Perhaps&nbsp;we should encourage&nbsp;some men&nbsp;to use sex robots. Men who get&nbsp;environmental&nbsp;cues that they’re evolutionary dead-ends disproportionately menace society. In the 1980s, evolutionary psychologist couple Wilson and Daly found that perpetrators of violence and homicide had something in common: they were young, single and didn’t have access to the kinds of resources&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21688587-young-single-idle-males-are-dangerous-work-and-wedlock-can-tame-them-men-and-mayhem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with which to win mates</a>. Polygynous societies in which wealthier men have access to multiple women are more violent and less stable because they have a class of young men without the prospect of getting a mate. Monogamy, rather than being the state of nature, may have been an …</p></div></article></div>

Our rotating cast of six drilled tones and measure words every Wednesday for about two years, in the 2nd Street WeWork, just south of Market Street in San Francisco.</p><p id="200a">Our teacher was a guy from Beijing named <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/dennis-language-services-san-francisco" rel="noopener">Dennis Zhu</a>. I got to know Dennis pretty well, and in many ways, he’s a stereotypical Boomer — mid-60s, kids in their 30s, west San Francisco house bought 20 years ago for peanuts — except he’d grown up in China. No doubt, the ’60s in the US were bad — assassinations, riots, Vietnam—but it’s a daytime sitcom compared to Dennis, who was forcibly moved to a farm, along with 10 million other “urban intellectual youth”, to play the harmonica and chop wood. They called it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_to_the_Countryside_Movement" rel="noopener">Down to the Countryside Movement</a>, only one part of the larger Cultural Revolution, that among other things included book burnings, mass executions, and the complete annihilation of land titles in large parts in China.</p><p id="399c">Big resettlements like this mark a generation. Fifty years on, Dennis can still tell you where he went, how he felt, and how pointless and futile the whole thing felt.</p><p id="2b6f">And here we are, somewhere in the middle (?) of the American COVID outbreak. My wife and I took a month or two off after Amelia, our first daughter, was born in early April, but the search for childcare has been difficult — reduced capacity at day cares, and a tight market for nanny share. With Caroline working remotely and me getting Dials up and running, we packed our bags and headed to my parents place in Homewood, the town of my childhood. Three generations sit down to dinner each night, and my parents couldn’t be happier.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="f055">Thus, our migration —the Down to the Suburbs Movement — or whatever we end up calling it.

Why someone making $12/hour at Target doesn’t want to pay yet another gas tax to get to work, living in a place without sidewalks, where the only real option is to drive.</p><p id="d2fb">The Down to the Suburbs Movement is our opportunity.

But there are different kinds of prosperity. Silicon Valley doesn’t look like Boston, or New York, or LA, or DC. I tried asking myself what word I’d use to describe the feeling the Valley radiated, and the word that came to mind was optimism.</p></blockquote><p id="c910">Few cities anywhere have the talent or tax base of a place like San Francisco. But every city has its strengths. I still think Chicago is the ideal site for a packaged food business accelerator. The south suburbs, where I am now, delivers an incredibly good quality of life even on $20–30k/year; that’s a major achievement in its own right, something the San Francisco Board of Supervisors could never accomplish, and the recipe for a manufacturing renaissance. The solution is playing to your strengths, not trying to out-chip or out-software Silicon Valley.</p><p id="97fc">My hope — prayer, even — is that we can use this time to spread a sense of optimism, progress, and belief that things can be better. This time won’t last forever. Try to use it well.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<p>Situationen omkring coronasmitte blandt mink har nu udviklet sig til et kritisk stadie i Nordjylland.</p>
<p>Helt inde i regeringskontorerne kategoriseres situationen som meget alvorlig, og der tales om en coronavirus 2.0.</p>


<p>Derfor har regeringen besluttet, at alle minkbesætninger nu skal slås ihjel, fordi coronavirus er muteret blandt mink og har spredt sig til mennesker.</p>
<p>Det fortæller statsminister Mette Frederiksen på et pressemøde onsdag.</p>
<div><p>»I mister livsværk, som i nogle tilfælde er gået i arv igennem flere generationer. Det er en sorgens dag for jer og for alle, der arbejder i mink-erhvervet. Det er regeringen bevidst om,« siger Mette Frederiksen til minkavlerne.</p><p>En muteret coronavirus er vandret fra mink til mennesker og har siden spredt sig kraftigt blandt borgerne i Nordjylland.</p></div>
<p>Tirsdag modtog regeringen et notat fra Statens Serum Institut (SSI), som har udsat den muterede coronavirus for antistoffer.</p>


<p>Resultatet var ifølge SSI dybt bekymrende, fordi den muterede coronavirus ikke reagerede godt på antistofferne.</p>

                                                                <span>Foto: Private photo</span>

<p>Dermed er der risiko for, at en eventuel vaccine mod covid-19 ikke vil have den ønskede effekt, hvis den muterede virus fra mink spreder sig yderligere blandt mennesker.</p>
<p>Samtidig er bekymringen, at den nye coronavirus fra mink betyder, at alle mennesker, som har været smittet med corona, igen kan blive ramt af den muterede coronavirus.</p>
<p>Der er desuden nye restriktioner på vej for borgere i en række kommuner i det nordjyske for at stoppe spredningen af coronavirussen fra mink.</p>


<p>Det drejer sig indtil videre om kommunerne Hjørring, Frederikshavn, Brønderslev, Jammerbugt, Thisted og Læsø, oplyser Mette Frederiksen.</p>
<p>»Vi ved godt, at vi efterlader jer i Nordjylland i uvished til i morgen. Det beklager jeg. Men vi skal handle nu. Det drejer sig om liv og død ikke kun i Danmark, men i hele verden,« siger Mette Frederiksen.</p>
<p>De nye restriktioner bliver meldt ud torsdag.</p>
<p>Siden regeringen modtog det bekymrende notat fra SSI tirsdag, har man i regeringskontorerne arbejdet på højtryk for at finde ud af, hvilke restriktioner der skal til.</p>


<p>Coronavirussen har spredt sig voldsomt på de danske minkfarme siden sommer. I skrivende stund har mere end 207 minkbesætninger fået konstateret corona, og derfor skal alle disse mink aflives.</p>
<p>Men nu lyder befalingen fra Mette Frederiksen, at samtlige mink på de godt 1.100 minkfarme i Danmark skal aflives.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The most fundamental core of any business relationship is trust. Traditionally this was built through multiple interactions, which included at least in-person meeting.</p><p>It seemed that something about meeting in person helped solidify what was discussed. Whether this is through body language or both parties being able to lower their guards and speak somewhat informally.</p><p>These in-person meetings have been a staple for long-lasting business relationships. However, the ability for these type of interactions has been put on hold thanks to the current pandemic. The startup community has had to adapt to these restrictions and in my opinion, the perfect environment for entrepreneurship was created.</p><p>People with extra time on their hands and nothing to do.</p><p>While I recognize and have experienced the downsides of this pandemic from a business perspective, I try to look at the positives. This motivation is what led to my most recent startup, <a href="https://accordably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accordably, which is a competitor monitoring solution</a>.</p><h2><strong>How do you find a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>Alright, great, you want to start a business, but how do you actually find a cofounder?</p><p>I wish I could tell you that this was the easy part, but it’s actually probably the hardest.</p><p>It’s going to be a lot of trial and error.</p><p>We are in more restricted social times, so it becomes even more difficult. A good place to start is with previous colleagues that you’ve worked with. You know them from a professional perspective, you’ve seen how they act with colleagues and their work ethic.</p><p>Remember, the stakes are much higher when it’s your own business, so these favourable employee working traits don’t always translate into a good cofounder.</p><p>Personally, I would recommend checking out different digital communities, you’d be surprised who you’ll meet and might find someone that has very similar goals to you.</p><p>My personal favourite community is Indie Hackers. They have a specific group called <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/looking-to-partner-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Looking to partner up”</a> and you will find a wide variety of people looking to start a business.</p><p>I am biased as that’s where I met the cofounder of Accordably.</p><h2><strong><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" alt="Remote cofounders of Accordably" width="1279" height="356" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w"></strong></h2><h2><strong>What to look for when choosing a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>The ideal match is someone who is the complete opposite of your skillset. Think of it like an ice hockey team. If your team was all goalies, you’d get nowhere. You need balance and different strengths to help push your product over the top.</p><p>Now one thing that shouldn’t be the complete opposite is your motivation. Finding someone who has the same drive is important or else there could be a growing resentment in your near future.</p><p>No two situations are the same and this is why it’s difficult to find a cofounder. There needs to be the right mix of similar professional goals and differing skillsets to build a strong tandem.</p><p>Another important attribute is whether you can see yourself getting along with this person from a social perspective. Face it, you’re going to have to spend a lot of time speaking with this person and planning out the future of your business.</p><p>There are some personality types that just don’t mix. Even if your skillsets are the perfect match, your mental health could be at risk if find yourself in a toxic work relationship.</p><p>For me, building a startup isn’t necessarily about the money (I mean it helps of course!) but it’s an outlet where my voice has a direct impact on the future of the business. I can test out crazy ideas and not worry about angry investors or upsetting management.</p><h2><strong>How to build trust when you’ve never met?</strong></h2><p>Just because you meet somebody in person doesn’t automatically create trust. Everyone has their own problems and you’ll never truly understand all the factors that go into their decisions.</p><p>So how do you build trust?</p><p>Time.</p><p>It takes time to build trust, you need to learn each others working habits, personalities and goals. After 2 weeks of working together, you should have a good understanding of the other person.</p><p>Of course, 2 weeks isn’t enough to jump into anything long term, but it will give you a good idea of direction and at that point, you can choose whether or not to continue.</p><p>While you should protect yourself, there’s no need to waste money on lawyers right at the start. Just write up a basic agreement that lays out your agreed upon terms and that you will revisit at a later stage.</p><p>Even with an agreement created by lawyers, you can get screwed over, so don’t worry about this too much at the start.</p><h2><strong>Finding the right idea</strong></h2><p>You’ve assembled a strong team, your skills match perfectly and you’re ready to go, but you’re missing one thing.</p><p>The idea!</p><p>This is difficult because whatever you choose you will be committing a large chunk of time to it, so you don’t want to make the wrong choice and get startup remorse.</p><p>Now I can’t stress this enough, no matter what you choose, make sure that it genuinely interests you. I’ve been in many situations that after the initial sparkle of an idea wears off, I’m stuck with a product that I find soul-crushingly boring.</p><p>The product may make money, but if you don’t enjoy it, it’s not worth it.</p><p>The approach that we took was rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis, we just started with something.</p><p>We started working on a server-side web analytics solution and testing the market on this idea. We focused on building the infrastructure and easily transferable parts that we could use for other ideas.</p><p>After about a month of building, two things happened:</p><ol><li>We had enough time to see if our working styles meshed, which they did.</li><li>An idea popped up from a client request that we both believed in.</li></ol><p>Long story short, instead of beating your head against a wall trying to find the perfect idea, <strong>just start! </strong></p><p>Start with anything, inspiration will come, staying stagnant will just make you another wantrepreneur.</p><h2><strong>Maintaining communication</strong></h2><p>When it comes to remote cofounders the importance of communication is multiplied. Setting up the proper channels and maintaining a clear schedule is critical for success.</p><p>Keeping your teammate informed of your daily/weekly goals helps motivate and set accountability.</p><p>It’s very easy to procrastinate when you’re “the boss” but when you see your cofounder working their ass off and you’re doing nothing, that guilt should set in. Unless of course, you’re a prick.</p><p>Our main communication hub is Slack and we have integrated all of our tools to send notifications to this platform. This is our main dashboard and it helps keeps us on the same page for the health of the business.</p><p>Figure out what works for your duo and run with it. For us, we will have one or two calls a week and then for the smaller topics, just send each other audios clips.</p><p>This style has worked for us because when a thought is fresh, you can send a quick audio snippet and the other can listen to it when they have time.</p><p>Getting sidetracked is a big problem, so try to stay on goal and not overcommunicate with long phone calls every day.</p><p>One piece of advice that I can share when it comes to communication is that tone is not conveyed properly over text. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen people get upset over an email or Slack message from a misunderstanding in tone.</p><p>In this digital world, don’t forget how to communicate. Jumping to conclusions or negatives will just set your team back. Clarify before making an unnecessary enemy.</p><h2><strong>Trust your gut</strong></h2><p>There is no one size fits all formula to finding a cofounder. People aren’t predictable. It takes time to find the right fit.</p><p>The one constant is your gut because no matter who you choose, you’re going to have to take a chance.</p><p>You could get burned or feel like you’re doing all the work, that’s just collateral damage in the life of an entrepreneur.</p><p>All that you can do is work with the information you’re given and decide if you believe in your cofounder. When it works, it works and you’ll eventually see success.</p><p>That’s what we’re working towards with Accordably and we’re excited to see what’s next for this project.</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <p>Nov 1, 2020</p>
  <div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>These are my notes after learning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a> algorithm.
The primary goal here is to sharpen my own understanding of the algorithm, but maybe someone will find this explanation of Paxos useful!
This post assumes fluency with mathematical notation.</p>


<p>That means that I didn’t actually understand the algorithm.</p>
<p>What finally made the whole thing click are</p>

<p>I now think that the thing is actually much simpler than it is made to believe :-)</p>
<p>Buckle in, we are starting!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what-is-paxos"><a href="#what-is-paxos"></a>What is Paxos?</h2>
<div>
<p>Paxos is an algorithm for implementing distributed consensus.
Suppose you have <code>N</code> machines which communicate over a faulty network.
The network may delay, reorder, and lose messages (it can not corrupt them though).
Some machines might die, and might return later.
Due to network delays, “machine is dead” and “machine is temporary unreachable” are indistinguishable.
What we want to do is to make machines agree on some value.
“Agree” here means that if some machine says “value is X”, and another machine says “value is Y”, then X necessary is equal to Y.
It is OK for machine to answer “I don’t know yet”.</p>
<p>The problem with this formulation is that Paxos is an elementary, but subtle algorithm.
To understand it (at least for me), a precise, mathematical formulation is needed.
So, let’s try again.</p>
<p>What is Paxos?
Paxos is a theorem about sets!
This is definitely mathematical, and is true (as long as you base math on set theory), but is not that helpful.
So, let’s try again.</p>
<p>What is Paxos?
Paxos is a theorem about nondeterministic state machines!</p>
<p>A system is characterized by a state.
The system evolves in discrete steps: each step takes system from <code>state</code> to <code>state'</code>.
Transitions are non-deterministic: from a single current <code>s1</code>, you may get to different next states <code>s2</code> and <code>s3</code>.
(non-determinism models a flaky network).
An infinite sequence of system’s states is called a behavior:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>state_0 → state_1 → ... → state_n → ...
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Due to non-determinism, there’s a potentially infinite number of possible behaviors.
Nonetheless, depending on the transition function, we might be able to prove that some condition is true for any state in any behavior.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example, and also introduce some notation.
I won’t use TLA+, as I don’t enjoy its concrete syntax.
Instead, math will be set in monospaced unicode.</p>
<p>The example models an integer counter.
Each step the counter decrements or increments (non-deterministically), but never gets too big or too small</p>
<div>
<p>Counter</p>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2

</pre></td><td><pre>Sets:
  ℕ -- Natural numbers with zero

Vars:
  counter ∈ ℕ

Init ≡
  counter = 0

Next ≡
    (counter &lt; 9 ∧ counter' = counter + 1)
  ∨ (counter &gt; 0 ∧ counter' = counter - 1)

Theorem:
  ∀ i: 0 ≤ counter_i ≤ 9

-- Notation
-- ≡: equals by definition
-- ∧: "and", conjunction
-- ∨: "or",  disjunction
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sate of the system is a single variable — <code>counter</code>.
It holds a natural number.
In general, we will represent a state of any system by a fixed set of variables.
Even if the system logically consists of several components, we model it using a single unified state.</p>
<p>The <code>Init</code> formula specifies the initial state, the <code>counter</code> is zero.
Note that <code>=</code> is a mathematical equality, and not an assignment.
<code>Init</code> is a <em>predicate</em> on states.</p>
<p><code>Init</code> is true for <code>{counter: 0}</code>.<br>
<code>Init</code> is false for <code>{counter: 92}</code>.</p>
<p><code>Next</code> defines a non-deterministic transition function.
It is a predicate on pairs of states, <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>.
<code>counter</code> is a variable in the <code>s1</code> state, <code>counter'</code> is the corresponding variable in the <code>s2</code> state.
In plain English, transition from <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code> is valid if one of these is true:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s1</code> is less than <code>9</code> and value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s2</code> is greater by 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s1</code> is greater than <code>0</code>, and value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s2</code> is smaller by 1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><code>Next</code> is true for <code>({counter: 5}, {counter: 6})</code>.<br>
<code>Next</code> is false for <code>({counter: 5}, {counter: 5})</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some behaviors of this system:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 0 → 1 → 0 → 1</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here are some <strong>non</strong> behaviors of this system:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5</code>: <code>Init</code> does not hold for initial state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 2</code>: <code>Next</code> does not hold for <code>(0, 2)</code> pair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 0 → -1</code>: <code>Next</code> does not hold for <code>(0, -1)</code> pair</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>“behavior” means that the initial state satisfies <code>Init</code>, and each transition satisfies <code>Next</code>.</p>
<p>We can state and prove a theorem about this system: for every state in every behavior, the value of counter is between 0 and 9.
Proof is by induction:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The condition is true in the initial state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the condition is true for state <code>s1</code>, and <code>Next</code> holds for <code>(s1, s2)</code>, then the condition is true for <code>s2</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QED.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As usual with induction, sometimes we would want to prove a <em>stronger</em> property, because it gives us more powerful base for an induction step.</p>
<p>To sum up, we define a non-deterministic state machine using two predicates <code>Init</code> and <code>Next</code>.
<code>Init</code> is a predicate on states which restricts possible initial states.
<code>Next</code> is a predicate on <em>pairs</em> of states, which defines a non-deterministic transition function.
<code>Vars</code> section describes the state as a fixed set of typed variables.
<code>Sets</code> defines auxiliary fixed sets, elements of which are values of variables.
<code>Theorem</code> section specifies a predicate on behaviors: <em>sequences</em> of steps evolving according to <code>Init</code> and <code>Next</code>.</p>
<p>The theorem does not automatically follow from <code>Init</code> and <code>Next</code>, it needs to be proven.
Alternatively, we can simulate a range of possible behaviors on a computer and check the theorem for the specific cases.
If the set of reachable states is small enough (finite would be a good start), we can enumerate <em>all</em> behaviors and produce a brute force proof.
If there are too many reachable states, we can’t prove the theorem this way, but we often can prove it to be wrong, by finding a counter example.
This is the idea behind model checking in general and TLA+ specifically.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-consensus"><a href="#what-is-consensus"></a>What is Consensus?</h2>
<div>
<p>Having mastered the basic vocabulary, let’s start slowly building towards Paxos.
We begin with defining what consensus is.
As this is math, we’ll do it using sets.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

14
</pre></td><td><pre>Sets:
  𝕍 -- Arbitrary set of values

Vars:
  chosen ∈ 2^𝕍 -- Subset of values

Theorem:
    ∀ i: |chosen_i| ≤ 1
  ∧ ∀ i, j: i ≤ j ∧ chosen_i ≠ {} ⇒ chosen_i = chosen_j

-- Notation
-- {}:  empty set
-- 2^X: set of all subsets of X, powerset
-- |X|: cardinality (size) of the set
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The state of the system is a set of chosen values.
For this set to constitute consensus (over time) we need two conditions to hold:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>at most one value is chosen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if we choose a value at one point in time, we stick to it (math friendly: any two chosen values are equal to each other)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here’s the simplest possible implementation of consensus:</p>
<div>
<p>Consensus</p>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2

</pre></td><td><pre>Sets:
  𝕍 -- Arbitrary set of values

Vars:
  chosen ∈ 2^𝕍 -- Subset of values

Init ≡
  chosen = {}

Next ≡
  chosen = {} ∧ ∃ v ∈ 𝕍: chosen' = {v}


Theorem:
    ∀ i: |chosen_i| ≤ 1
  ∧ ∀ i, j: i ≤ j ∧ (chosen_i ≠ {} ⇒ chosen_i = chosen_j)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the initial state, the set of chosen values is empty.
We can make a step if the current set of chosen values is empty, in which case we select an arbitrary value.</p>
<p>This technically breaks our behavior theory: we require behaviors to be infinite, but, for this spec, we can only make a single step.
The fix is to allow empty steps: a step which does not change the state at all is always valid.
We call such steps “stuttering steps”.</p>
<p>The proof of the first condition of the consensus theorem is a trivial induction.
The proof of the second part is actually non-trivial, here’s a sketch.
Assume that <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are indices, which violate the condition.
They might be far from each other in state-space, so we can’t immediately apply <code>Next</code>.
So let’s choose the <em>smallest</em> <code>j1 ∈ [i+1;j]</code> such that the condition is violated.
Let <code>i1 = j1 - 1</code>.
The condition is still violated for <code>(i1, j1)</code> pair, but this time they are subsequent steps, and we can show that <code>Next</code> does not hold for them, concluding the proof.</p>
<p>Yay! We have a distributed consensus algorithm which works for 1 (one) machine:</p>
<div>
<p>Distributed Consensus For One Machine</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick arbitrary value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="simple-voting"><a href="#simple-voting"></a>Simple Voting</h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s try to extend this to a truly distributed case, where we have <code>N</code> machine (“acceptors”).
We start with formalizing the naive consensus algorithm: let acceptors vote for values, and select the value which gets a majority of votes.</p>
<div>
<p>Majority Vote</p>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

  𝕍 -- Arbitrary set of values
  𝔸 -- Finite set of acceptors

Vars:
  votes ∈ 2^(𝔸×𝕍) -- Set of (acceptor, value) pairs

Init ≡
  votes = {}

Next ≡
  ∃ a ∈ 𝔸:
      ∃ v ∈ V: votes' = votes ∪ {(a, v)}
    ∧ ∀ v ∈ V: (a, v) ∉ votes

chosen ≡
  {v ∈ V: |{a ∈ 𝔸: (a, v) ∈ votes}| &gt; |𝔸| / 2}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The state of the system is the set of all votes cast by all acceptors.
We represent a vote as a pair of an acceptor and the value it voted for.
Initially, the set of votes is empty.
On each step, some acceptor casts a vote for some value (adds <code>(a, v)</code> pair to the set of votes), but only if it hasn’t voted yet.
Remember that <code>Next</code> is a predicate on pairs of states, so we check <code>votes</code> for existing vote, but add a new one to <code>votes'</code>.
The value is chosen if the set of acceptors which voted for the value (<code>{a ∈ 𝔸: (a, v) ∈ votes}</code>) is at least half as large as the set of all acceptors.
In other words, if a majority of acceptors has voted for the value.</p>

<p>Let’s prove consensus theorem for Majority Vote protocol.
TYPE ERROR, DOES NOT COMPUTE.
The consensus theorem is a predicate on behaviors of states consisting of <code>chosen</code> variable.
Here, <code>chosen</code> isn’t a variable, <code>votes</code> is!
<code>chosen</code> is a function which maps current state to some boolean.</p>
<p>While it is intuitively clear what “consensus theorem” would look like for this case, let’s make this precise.
Let’s <em>map</em> states with <code>votes</code> variable to states with <code>chosen</code> variable using the majority rule, <code>f</code>.
This mapping naturally extends to a mapping between corresponding behaviors (sequences …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A University of Cordoba and University of Cambridge study analyzed what factors in childhood and adolescence increase the likelihood of having violent behavior in adulthood</p><div>
			
<p>There is another pandemic that humans have been experiencing for a long time now and for which effective preventive measures have yet to be found: violence. This is shown in various ways in different aspects of life and continues to have serious consequences for society, the economy, our health and human relations. The onset of violent behavior can be observed from childhood and adolescence, so studying what aspects lead to the development of these kinds of behaviors and which curb them has become a necessary step in their prevention.</p>
<p>The University of Cordoba and the University of Cambridge have been collaborating for a long time now on research into aspects related to violence, thus helping decrease its risks and prevent it. In their latest piece of research, they studied possible risk and protection factors for violence and, in this way, they verified whether violent behavior can be predicted months or even years before it develops.</p>
<p>Specifically, the study focused on finding out if morality, victimization, empathy and social and emotional skills predict the expression of different violent behaviors in children and adolescents in different contexts, including at school and in a family setting. "These behaviors refer to, for instance, troubling behavior at home, including physical violence towards parents and siblings, at school, including physical violence towards teaching staff and schoolmates, and other settings, including bad behavior in public", explains Raquel Espejo Siles, doctoral student at the University of Cordoba who carried out this research during her stay at the Institute of Criminology at the University of Cambridge thanks to one of the ELMER grants from the Diputación de Córdoba (Cordoba's county government).</p>
<p>Raquel Espejo worked with Izabela Zych, Professor at the Psychology Department at the University of Cordoba and part of the LAECOVI (Study Laboratory on Coexistence and Violence Prevention) research group, whose line of research is this study's framework. The study also had the participation of David P. Farrington, Emeritus Professor of Criminology at the University of Cambridge, and Vicente J. Llorent, Professor at the Education Department at the University of Cordoba.</p>
<p>871 students between 10 and 17 years of age at different Andalusian educational centers took part in the research. They filled out two questionnaires, one in June 2017 and one in June 2018.</p>
<p>Interesting conclusions were drawn from the results. "We found that violence used directly towards people was related to a tendency to make impulsive decisions and to a blind motivation to accomplish one's aims, without regard for the disadvantages or negative consequences from using violence", reveals Raquel Espejo.</p>
<p>What is more, being a victim of bullying was detected as a risk factor for developing violent behavior at home against their family as well as at school. Likewise, those people who were violent in public or in class were shown to have higher scores in moral disengagement, meaning that they usually made excuses so that these acts would seem less serious than they really were.</p>
<p>At school, it was verified that higher scores for social and emotional competencies such as social awareness, self-management, motivation and decision making are protection factors against violence. Therefore, these results support prevention initiatives based on the potential of learning social and emotional skills at home as well as at school.</p>
<p>The data show that reducing victimization in a school setting could be effective in decreasing violence in different contexts in the future. "It is important to prevent violence, both victimization and bullying, since the data found in this study and others indicate that violence is a vicious cycle. Being the aggressor or the victim entails a high risk of developing the opposite role, reinforcing and increasing violence both at school and outside of school", points out Raquel Espejo.</p>
<p>According to this research study, enabling teenagers to reassess their goals and the consequences of their violent behavior could have an impact on decreasing violence further down the road. In addition, teaching different strategies to resolve issues in a different way could help them to compare and see the high individual and social price to pay for violent behavior.</p>
<p>This study is part of the "E-intelligence: risks and opportunities of emotional competencies expressed online" (PSI-2015-64114-R) project of the National Research, Development and Innovation Program, subsidized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Competitiveness. With the aim of having greater understanding of the reality of violence in childhood and adolescence, the team will continue to research about violent behavior in face to face and online contexts. Firstly, they have studied the factors that can curb or increase cyberhate in a study funded by the Center for Andalusian Studies. Secondly, they will continue working on the same line of research, investigating the link between bullying and drug use in a study financed by the Ministry of Health.</p>

      <h2>Self Referential Formula in Math</h2>
      <p>Keywords: math, quine, self-reference, Tupper</p>
      <p>Published: 23 Jun 2011 - see updates at the bottom</p>
      <h3>Tupper's formula</h3>
      <p>
        <b>See newer self-referential stuff:</b>
        <a href="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference-smooth/index.html">my 2019 self-referential formula uses Bézier curves instead of bitmaps</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have seen <a href="https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/how-does-tuppers-self-referential-formula-work/">
        this blog about Tupper self-referential formula</a> recently.
        This formula is interesting. Its graph contains all possible
        bitmaps that fit in region of 17 * 106 grid. So it is not much
        of wonder that one of those many bitmaps contains meaningful
        representation of the formula itself. Actually, there multiple
        ways to fit the formula in 17*106 grid, so there are multiple
        occurrences of the formula in the graph. But there are also
        all other formulas that fit. It is not truly self-referential
        since number N which you need to find right viewport is not
        included inside (see updates at the bottom, Jeff Tupper has
	produced additional formulas that are truly self-referential,
	but this famous one is not).
	You cannot fit a bitmap represented as number
        in the same bitmap as fonts you would use for base-10 number
        would take at least 4*3 "pixels" per digit while that digit
        carries only log<sub>2</sub>10 bits. Is there a better way
        than that? Some form of compression might work.
      </p>
      <h3>Trávník's formula</h3>
      <p>
        So I though how I would design a formula that would be truly
        self-referential. This design process is more like programming
        for several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I expected it will take one evening (4hrs), but it took
        three evenings :-)</li>
        <li>I had to debug the formula and refine it until it started to work.</li>
        <li>Formula had to be designed incrementally, in small pieces.</li>
        <li>Getting the picture takes a lot of computational time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here is the formula in final form (I will probably describe
        steps how I arrived to this form in some follow up article if
        there is enough interest). Originally I have used Haskell in
        design process. To verify final form, I had to create
        C program (uses GMP big number library) since Haskell was too
        slow. This allowed me to verify it again that the formula is
        matching the program. This is the formula as formated with
        LyX:
      </p>
      
      <p><img src="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference/travnik-self-referential-formula-lyx.png" alt="Travnik's self referential formula (LyX)"></p><p>
        Now this one omitted the value of N. The N is very big number,
        it contains 12876 digits. You can see the N in the graph of
        the function below. Also, you can copy and paste the N from
        C source program below. Here is the function as it graphs
        itself (inside yellow border):
      </p>
      
      <p><img src="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference/travnik-self-referential-formula-graph.png" alt="Travnik's self referential formula (graph)"></p><p>
        You can find source of the program I used to plot it <a href="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference/selfref-demo.c">here</a> (it requires <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP big number library</a> to
        compile and run). At the top of the program there are
        constants which allow to define viewport you want. It is set
        to some interesting region that includes part of N. But you
        can set it to whole region if you have patience. Output graph
        is printed on terminal, '#' denotes true value, ' ' denotes
        false values. If you set wider X axis than fits the terminal,
        you can redirect to file and open in non-word wrapping editor
        with monospaced font. I have transformed such file to PBM
        ASCII format and used GIMP to get the image above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beware that the C program is very slow. On my computer it ran
        for about 30 hours. I could optimize it, but I wanted the
        functions in C to correspond closely to the functions in the
        formula. While the program uses integer values for x and
        y computation, you can graph it with real valued x and y too.
        You can make it significantly faster if you don't want
        to see all digits of the N in this way. Replace:
      </p>
      <pre>        nnnBase10Len=strlen(strnnn)-1;
      </pre>
      <p>with</p>
      <pre>        nnnBase10Len=60;
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this case, you will see only last 60 digits of the N (and
        they will be shifted to different locations).
      </p>

<p>Avoiding stupidity is a powerful way to reach your success goals. You don’t always need to do great things. You can go a long way if you avoid stupid mistakes.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am talking about the stupid things I have done while building my first startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I joined&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-w17-launch-lively-scaphold-marketfox-floyd-servx-fibo-and-wifi-dabba/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketfox</a>&nbsp;with the dream of building the next big thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We had the opportunity to move to the much-coveted Silicon Valley, after being funded by Ycombinator – one of the best startup accelerators in the world. It was a dream come true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward two years, we had to shut down the company due to several reasons – one of them being the lack of revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few stupid things I have done while building that startup.</p>



<h2><strong>Not taking care of ourselves</strong></h2>



<p>Rents in the Bay Area are super high.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We didn’t have a fortune back then. We were on a budget – but I think we could have used what we had to do certain things better.</p>



<p>We slept on the carpeted floor. All we had was one table and a few chairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We worked mostly sitting on the floor, combating the cold mornings. It also took a toll on our productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My cofounder took the picture below – I had fallen asleep writing code.</p>

<h2><strong>Working 15-16 hours a day</strong></h2>



<p>Hard work is romanticized by the startup world. I used to brag how many hours I worked a day as if it is an achievement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do not get me wrong – consistent work matters a lot if you want to be successful.</p>



<p>But the number of hours is not directly proportional to the output and is far from the outcome. Your body needs rest and good food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After some point, we lost the notion of day and night. We slept at random times, woke up at random times, and continued working.</p>



<h2><strong>Imbalance in decision making</strong></h2>



<p>Most of the decisions were often made by a single person, without enough brainstorming. It is not the ideal way of working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast decision making is crucial in a startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is also important to include the key people and letting them have their say in making that decision.</p>



<p>Talk about things you feel are wrong. If you do not value your opinions, do not expect someone else to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Never let someone else control you. Never let someone else make a decision that is yours.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Not moving enough</strong></h2>



<p>It took me a while to understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle. The effects of physical exercise on mental health are still very underrated.</p>



<p>In the beginning, we worked and we slept. That was it. Over time we started going for occasional walks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We always resort to eating junk food(which I don’t regret much, because most of them were delicious) and not exercising enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far it was about personal mistakes, but we also made plenty of classic startup mistakes along the way. </p>



<h2><strong>Not talking to our customers</strong></h2>



<p>We shipped features at a tremendous pace. But we never talked to enough users to identify if it was something necessary. We assumed things and kept building – in a few months, we had a product which was an engineering marvel – but nobody cared to use.</p>



<h4><strong>Too much building and not enough selling</strong></h4>



<p>I still look back with awe at the speed with which we shipped. But it does not matter if you cannot sell the product.</p>



<p>We focused less on selling and this was a big mistake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were very naive to think that building software is the hardest part of building a startup.</p>



<h2><strong>Copying from competitors&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>All the companies do this. Look at what stories from Snapchat have done to the social apps.</p>



<p>But even when you copy features, you have to make sure your users want it. Instagram copied the stories successfully, but when Medium tried the same, it was not very successful.</p>



<p>Copying from the competition will only get you as far as them. Your goal should be to build things that are much better than them if you want to make people switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless the new product is excellent, it won’t overcome the pain of making the switch.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Lack of vision</strong></h4>



<p>It is always a good idea to have a grand vision for the company if you are raising venture capital.</p>



<p>We blindly kept building features without any vision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A simple question we should ask ourselves is – Who is your ideal user? What do they want to achieve with your product?</p>



<p>We had a bunch of features, probably what five different products would have done. But no single user wanted.</p>



<h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. It was an experience that changed my life for the good. I’m happy that I did it – I am happy that I tried and failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I learned a lot. About people, trust, and startups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
or <b>Better Digital Living By Making Things Harder For Yourself</b><br>
or <b>I spent a Year Without Facebook and Google - Here's What Happened Next</b><br>
</p>

<p><em>Autumn 2020</em></p>


<p>
It's easy to grow disillusioned with tech, even to the point that it 
appals you. I've been using computers since 1988 and the net since 1995
and over time, something's happened. During the last decade or so, my 
mind has increasingly been preoccupied with the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm no longer in control of my computer and my OS.</li>
<li>The modern web is a cesspool of tracking scripts, ads, 
malware and clickbait designed to suck you in and make you stupid.</li>
<li>Even the most premium commercial software and hardware more often
than not comes with contraptions to spy on you.</li>
<li>"Cloud apps" are replacing programs I'd much rather run natively.</li>
<li>Thus, we sacrifice our privacy and intellects for faux conveniences.</li>
<li>The Idealist Net we fondly remember is long dead and unlikely to come
back.</li>
<li>...but there are still pockets of sanity left.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a child of the home computer boom, I'm used to general purpose 
machines that do my bidding without interference from neither the 
manufacturer nor some unknown other wanting to sell me Depends and 
Bitcoins. That's what I want my computing to <i>still</i> be like.
</p>

<p>
The Man wants something different, though. The Man wants you to log in, 
click accept, sell your soul and Buy More Stuff. Hence, working to avoid 
that must be some level of subversive computing: Sticking it to The Man, 
one bit at a time.
</p>

<p>
In this text, I'll try to outline how I do my best to achieve that. Fair 
warning: it doesn't come without what some would call sacrifice, because 
you can't have the cake and eat it. This "sacrifice", however, might 
ultimately turn out to be beneficial.
</p>

<h2>What I absolutely do not use</h2>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>
This is a dead giveaway, of course. No facebook and no facebook services 
(E.G. instagram, whatsapp, messenger, etc).
</p>

<p>
Quitting was, considering the circumstances, very easy. I'd had a 
facebook account since 2007 and I used to live there, sometimes posting 
several times a day and checking in much more often. In the summer of 
2019, I wrote a goodbye post and the day after, I closed my account. 
This is more than a year ago now and I don't miss it.
</p>

<p>
I had an Instagram account for a while, but only used it for maybe a 
month or two. It's the second stupidest "service" available on the net 
right now, and that's saying a lot: It is, quite literally, a site 
where millions of people post daily photos of their dinners. To put it 
as nicely as I can: Instagram has absolutely zero content of any kind of 
real importance to anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None, really. It turns out that people who are 
interested in meeting with or talking to you will send an email or text 
or perhaps even call you. I'm also particularly thankful I didn't have to
witness the COVID-19 debacle unfold on social media.
</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>
Beating Instagram, Twitter is currently the stupidest site on the net. 
Best described as a slowly decomposing swamp of infighting and political 
bickering, it's full of people who will not yield a millimeter in any 
direction and will never, ever change their opinions about anything.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None. Ditching twitter is something I advice 
everyone to do, even those who will gladly sell their DNA for a bit of 
"free" online convenience. You'll feel much more at peace with the world 
without it.
</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>
If facebook is a dead giveaway, this is the truly crucial part of the 
concept. Facebook deals with distractions - Google deals with 
infrastructure. No longer one of many actors on the net, their monopoly 
quite simply dictates what goes and what doesn't. A recent reminder was 
when their domain blacklisting suddenly identified 
pouet.net, an innocent site for discussing the demo scene, as a spreader 
of malware. Things were, as usual, only resolved because someone knew 
someone who worked at Google. To discourage their thuggish, predatory 
behavior, we should avoid them in any way possible.
</p>

<p>
I closed down my Google account together with my Facebook account. I 
haven't missed that one, either. I also switched to searching with 
DuckDuckGo. The major point here is to <i>not</i> find a "replacement 
Google", such as Office 365 and Onedrive. That's not taking back control 
over your data, that's just handing it to the next buffoon for continued 
mining.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I now pay for my email. A mom-and-pop hosts it 
all for a very reasonable yearly fee and they throw in some pretty 
decent web hosting, too. Complete self-hosting would of course be ideal 
from a privacy standpoint, but I'm happy with this solution. I can also 
mount the home directory through sshfs, which makes it an excellent 
"cloud drive". When I've been in contact with their customer support,
they've been timely, friendly, efficient and professional.
</p>

<p>
All things considered, it's probably nowhere near as safe 
from third-party intrusion and reliable against service outage as 
the Google equivalent, but then again I didn't use Google Drive for
anything important, either. That's what my hard drives and USB sticks are for. 
Don't hand over the stuff that matters to third parties if you can avoid 
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat:</b> Some people might actually need Google Docs for work, because 
employers like to force their employees into certain ecosystems. I'm 
forced into other ecosystems by mine, see
<a href="#tacs">Tradeoffs and Concessions</a>
below. The best option in these cases is of course to use it exclusively for 
work, exclusively on your work computer and in a separate web browser if
possible.
</p>

<h3>Many more sites</h3>

<p>
There are tons of sites, services and apps I don't use, for example 
Paypal and Dropbox. In fact, I avoid most sites where I have to register 
an account.
</p>

<h3>Phone Apps</h3>

<p>
My employer supplies me with a smartphone. On it I keep only the apps I 
need for work and banking. When commuting was still a thing, I also 
listened to Spotify. Other than that, I try to use it as little as 
possible these days. I do carry it with me, though: it mostly works fine 
as a phone and mobile phones are pretty damn convenient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I've never been fond of having a lot of apps.
Most of them are pointless and solve completely invented problems.
</p>

<h3>My local newspaper</h3>

<p>
I used to pay for an online subscription, until I just decided to stop 
one day. Apart from the poor quality of journalism, the biased reporting and 
the insipid editorial texts, I was basically paying money to keep feeding 
the online ad machine. That's a no-go.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> It's probably a reasonable idea to keep somewhat 
informed about current events. <a href="#news">See "News" below.</a>
</p>

<h2>Things I do use</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
In terms of user empowerment, even Canonical's Ubuntu with its telemetry 
and mysterious snap packages is so far a much better choice than any 
proprietary home computer OS on the market. From a privacy standpoint, 
other distributions, such as Debian and Slackware, are of course even 
better.
</p>

<h3>Native software</h3>

<p>
Turns out there are plenty of good programs that can be used completely 
offline and will let you store your files locally. They're not even hard 
to find. A few tips: Abiword, GNumeric, The Gimp, WordGrinder, 
Audacious.
</p>


<h3>The Web</h3>

<h4>The web, method one: Links2</h4>

<p>
The web still has good parts and I want to get at those good parts. 
Turns out the really good parts are usually remnants of The Old Web, 
consisting of HTML and great content.
</p>

<p>
I try to do as much web browsing as possible in Links2. It's a fast, 
lean browser with zero support for JavaScript and CSS. The latter means 
some sites look a bit funky. The former means some sites won't work at 
all. My usual strategy for sites that won't render without JavaScript is 
to simply ignore them. If they can't produce something worthwhile 
without scripting, it's probably not worthwhile at all.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, no JavaScript means that most trackers and other spy- 
and malware just won't run at all. Since Links doesn't save <i>any</i> 
cookies between sessions, other means of tracking will at least be kept 
somewhat confused. The flip side is that it's probably an extremely 
unique browser fingerprint.
</p>

<h4>The web, method two: RSS and native applications</h4>

<p>
You can subscribe to Youtube channels, subreddits and pretty much every 
blog out there using RSS. There are also plenty of specialized TUI:s and 
CLI:s for interfacing with various popular websites such as Youtube and 
Reddit.
</p>

<h4>The web, method three: Firefox with UBlock Origin</h4>

<p>
For some things, like banking and filing taxes, the Internet really has 
made things so much more convenient I don't want to live without them. 
Although my bank could easily provide the services I use completely 
without a single line of JavaScript, they have decided not to. This also 
goes for most online shopping. For these types of sites, I use Firefox.
</p>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>
There's still plenty of worthwhile content published on Youtube, not 
least recordings of demo scene productions for obscure hardware.
</p>

<p>
I watch Youtube using my own <a href="https://datagubbe.se/yt">tube script</a> in 
combination with a media player. It's not ideal, since Google will be 
able to infer a bit about my habits through my IP (although that could 
of course be mitigated using a VPN) and some videos don't work due to 
various restrictions imposed by their creators (or copyright laws). 
Somewhere around 90% of them do though, especially the interesting 
ones such as Computerphile and Numberphile). The upside is freedom from 
ads and algorithmic "recommendations": I watch only the videos I really 
want to watch.
</p>

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>

<p>
Still a useful and usable site.
</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<p>
Most of the content produced by news media is either clickbait or some 
kind of "commentary" by "experts" on actual headline news, which can 
then be milked for another couple of days. More often than not, the 
reporting is either misinformed, or biased, or both. Still, keeping 
somewhat updated can be beneficial for private decision making and 
overall …</p></div></div>

<p>Infection Monkey powered by Guardicore is a popular Open Source project and essentially a Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tool that analyzes and breaks down the robustness of cloud-based development environments, regardless of if they are of the private or public type.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ShayNehmad">Shay Nehmad</a>, a seasoned Open Source developer, and Shreya Malviya, a contributor to Infection Monkey, spoke to the participants about how Swimm is making it easier to contribute to the project and make a difference.</p>
<p>The resiliency to post-breach attacks and lateral movement is done with the help of automatic attack simulations that inject a random machine with a proprietary Infection Monkey code, which helps gauge and discover security loopholes and vulnerabilities. Think of it as an automated Pen Testing tool.</p>
<p>The 48 hour online event devoted to encouraging contributions to open source projects hosted by Brian Douglas of Github,&nbsp; the Open Sauced community and backed by Swimm.</p>
<p>Check out the event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHyZ0Wz_A44Ul9-YwiT-zt-JgEy3lRGns">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Infection Monkey using Swimm</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/guardicore/monkey#:~:text=The%20Infection%20Monkey%20is%20an,a%20centralized%20Monkey%20Island%20server.">Infection Monkey</a> is very straightforward and user-friendly. The Monkey, is a proprietary tool that infects random machines in the target environment and propagates to them. And there is Monkey Island, a dedicated centralized dashboard to monitor the results and findings. More about the Infection Monkey installation process <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/infectionmonkey/wt/">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://swimm.io/media/screen-shot-2020-11-04-at-11.02.48.png" alt="The Map" title="github.com/guardicore/monkey"></p>
<p>Besides being a non-intrusive and plug-and-play tool, Infection Monkey requires zero maintenance and runs around the clock for comprehensive security analysis. Furthermore, users can also get actionable insights and recommendations with the ability to define alerts as per their requirements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Swimm makes the onboarding of contributors to open source projects easier. Since everything related to Swimm is within the Infection Monkey (henceforth: IM) repository, all that you have to do is to clone that repo, start the terminal, and run the command “swimm start” on your terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the server starts, it automatically opens the Swimm homepage, which already has playlists for IM. Currently, the repository includes three playlists (Post-breach action, Configuration, and System Info Collection). For this tutorial, we will use an extra-verbose playlist called “Adding a PBA in 5 Simple Steps”.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wbkmZQhpI08v8F6ivT_mEp0Dsa7mAQ-g9xS4VGAs5-GZniEwnEl_BHm4ui5BqxZRB613RULmPIk1uXOmsVQOVCR5xFmHjUevYXWcrkOk7Rs6BdYT-qQe9bZGhZL-aC1neoYxnROu" alt=""></p>
<p>In a nutshell, Infection Monkey is a penetration testing tool and it simulates a person breaking into your system. Once the person is inside your system, they can perform additional actions after conducting the breach. In IM terminology, these are referred to as the “post-breach actions” or PBAs.</p>
<h4>Define What Your New PBA Does</h4>
<p>This is the actual coding step. As the name suggests, it basically defines what your new PBA does. So, briefly, you have to define what this step will do in IM (as stated in the description). This step also gives you instructions to run the manual test after you are done. But first, let’s do the main coding part.</p>
<p>All you have to do is copy the command from the Swimm interface and run it on your terminal. This will give you some information about this particular unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/n--uGoeV2gCm-JCZzKWr3nchhCZsHE8AkrldGNKm-L6uzNRQ4LDeB1zjwooiiENFs5_AAvdu3nSLMKeW0EUTfcewurPHMBbs_3a5RA0F_Nva7nfwAURu_3FGKjhO9QVSejoWHFL6" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the “Definition of done” says that you need a new constant defining what the PBA does. Now, you can ask Swimm to tell you which particular files are relevant to this specific Unit by running the command “Swimm Files”. It shows you the name of one file which is relevant to this Unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vtfc9Vr61m_8KQr9uOBS6eK2qMRVgoeCPZRuatXYzAVR40xiq41d3jKJKNql6FRg5GIDNwo26-2X2PPhMAsXNlboVXxKwwcOXdHMrf0bun0_ZYCQtUGOGQxvxRfUSmHS-GEgg4i_" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is pretty cool if you think about how you would do personal onboarding with someone. You would guide them toward the files relevant to what you are teaching.” - Shay Nehmad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we have to see how to define the name of the PBA which is to be done in this file. This really shows how building the Unit correctly can “emulate” or replace the personal onboarding process. Also, another thing we should notice here is that this particular file is in the module called “common”.</p>
<p>This suggests that everything we will do here is going to affect both the Monkey and the Swimm server. Open this file.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lnAb1DR5i9wnsoAZJNe76VeHqwv0wW4xyI9drUrGrH8MgXU6GK_-DRCbL8OGFHCfumQfR0KlvKALtpT-KMfox3wTMdbt0RDAyi89AZZ7CJx9ojaycexEHjTJshfvqdAXyoDGfMxd" alt=""></p>
<p>The comments generated by Swimm show you where you need to add your code. But if you are not sure about what to do next, Swimm provides hints via the command `swimm hint`.</p>
<p>If you go back to the file and look at that PBA, it basically tells you what the PBA with the name “Timestomping” does. That’s how you will also define the name of your new PBA. Add your new PBA “POST_BREACH_SCHEDULE_JOBS” and save the file. You have refined your new PBA, but how do we know this works?</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZMTPTwtUn17Qz2ABXXby8GipDAQSj9vwCgdlWgzYq85FoEBCOHHfkdijUQ5pBFPM-zXneonQNd1fuD0BFgWKtcc3tCE2CxvwD7dOelMiHXvAh9ahDusmIWZWCaEKe84Jghxvreom" alt=""></p>
<p>It's pretty easy when you are using Swimm. Let’s go back to the Swimm interface and learn about some easy and straightforward instructions to run the test.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oj-L3LjKzRhVqKbmPagGdHtkj-AoNYzEgKJ0P8tcg4es6sf1s-TnbG-Ig3BR0t4quDKl6UummO4FJXc-ifobCpWy79QOY-OfQYFexiqYVB3QnrFMxxnZ1dnFvuTuBapRClBTVMyN" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s study the result of this test from its image.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bVQos7iG-I40XJfiDKJ7DH-SnUCed0Xtp5csLgqyLAmDTlUWkqzSRuG6H5DZB6xaLgav7qzcnEhIZrZRW1PZMemZyWYlVLp2YNNWH6Sjdfpz9jAcS4mCxMBKv_SAPd4W91wsmu7o" alt=""></p>
<p>Whatever you added to the PBA definitions file, you should be able to see in the test report. Once you are done studying it, you can mark it as done with the command `swimm done`. This will take you to a Swimm status page (see below) that also allows you to compare your solution to the original codebase.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nU2b4mGCv-mhVLPL8PotXYIeFC70Sid_prw7-oBbknXgnHJxIDSNG8DcwMZ6-19m90mJW4MPX6tEcHPLr3D6YkoO8A90Lya1T0iA9U8My7Eb3BTZntGwb20p6Tf256apGCynI5il" alt=""></p>
<h2>Implement a New PBA</h2>
<p>Now, we know that the schedule jobs PBA is pretty dangerous because if someone is able to schedule jobs on your system, they can leave open a backdoor or ensure a virus downloads itself in case it gets deleted.</p>
<p>So do you now have to schedule jobs in your operating systems? Luckily, Infection Monkey already has these commands in the codebase.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Wc1t9yejLqPPj7VTsIiOB-yIh9N-EVy27EiH9conClOaIA1HAtSpgXlqXrRK0zTqSxK2v1I7Wzw0z94HlAZy8mzfOV0D9sZ-tu5vU1MpfTJi_szhgNGrBjU2v-VRRVfiH0_tsUpI" alt=""></p>
<p>So, all you need to do is fetch commands from a function called `get_commands_to_schedule_jobs`.</p>
<p>Once again, the description of this Unit also shows a manual test to run after writing the code. Just like in the previous Unit, we can play the Unit by copying the command from the Swimm interface and running it on your terminal. You can also request Swimm to tell you the relevant files with the same command.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bMfq0Tlu_TT2BXFJ6z7Bb9SCrN158jAPBO-UKGbhAj2XLqISnxL3c6T_cKXpSGXV-FPlYcgVyQ2R7ejaeFsYM71saNVBIbiIFJ8T3irHqE75aE1TtBp7UORLrR1uAljI3NmkEBZJ" alt=""></p>
<p>This time it tells you that the relevant file is in a module called “infection_monkey” which suggests that whatever we will be doing is going to affect the Monkey (i.e. the virtual intruder simulated by Infection Monkey) itself. This makes sense because you will basically be adding new functionality.</p>
<p>So, once you open the file, you will see a comment that tells you where you need to add your new code. This is something that leaves no place for error.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wD6oSMRb2YH2qY-ZJALKj3FEs10TJO7GaZuU2CFJW2ysPjvYvyPVolFmakq549bFyec4P_hsDNr1iPqpijLwDE6uWEizlQdn9YeJMCMeiQ3BCrd5-8v-ulefx5vfCSaoyouk5EVT" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s ask Swimm for more hints about how to proceed with coding in this Unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ffI32iZ3jXpwLuGRb-EGO9tQyZLRIQASQa5AUFY2tImzdEo8ZVMqoNkg0T0h6iniEx-IfowbVRxNpnUELuWi3eGjBidBtl9dP8BINBHzP5AVCkZ__u0hrW6n1EYw4t8JqaMtHTNX" alt=""></p>
<p>Swimm provides you with two hints. Let’s go ahead with the first one which suggests you check the “Time Stomping” PBA to get an idea about the implementation.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RtASkWQPjlZjjUAdFvzPXiV0Zttvuj7VxpbODATTF1aALEv4B9kKhas61sDZO7ikmID77Bs7jX2EF7n1Du-RD8djCShbTW2EpXZZy3dCyG9svG8OoXaoC_z7lgP49NHSxxgY35Vz" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see here that we are basically fetching Linux and Windows commands from a function called `get_timestomping_commands`. Then you will call the constructor for the parent class with the name of the PBA, the Linux commands, and the Windows commands as arguments.</p>
<p>So, you will do something similar to “schedule jobs” PBA.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HhKuTh0wzVAHddeJHHGY7PYUKSweb0TdHtM3hgd3WPgYVIfNL1bKzRuUsvwbH0RC1ml4wsNeivKW9AxrjUd9CvBF6wNQO0txtFfJJPFcljUrS50Gd5P3jSS8fVBygPubLS3ZMGdk" alt=""></p>
<p>Here, you can see the code fetches the commands from the function given in the description and it calls the constructor of the parent class.</p>
<p>Swimm has given you a second hint that notifies you to remove your PBA by removing the schedule jobs.</p>
<p>For that purpose, you can see a call to the function called `remove_scheduled_jobs`.</p>
<p>You can really walk through each line of the solution and see how building the Unit correctly nudged whoever’s solving it to write each line. So, from lines 13 to 18, that was the first hint telling you the general structure of how to implement post-breach actions in IM that are based on shell commands.</p>
<p>Following the hint shows you an example of how to write that code. Another cool thing pops up when we look at line 16. We can see the code is pulling the name of the PBA from the variable we defined in the previous Unit. The last line is from the second hint.</p>
<p>You may decide to not look at the hints and go blind trying to solve it. In this case, when you mark your unit done in Swimm and then compare it to the actual solution, you’ll find that discrepancy. If you forgot to remove the scheduled jobs, you will find it in the diff. It’s up to you as the Swimmer to choose if you’d rather see hints or not.</p>
<p>Now that you have added the code, let’s run the manual test by following the instructions in the Unit’s description.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/h2EUcy5vZxKp9DkINaiSFjQ-5Yv7f_MtnaL5q27cucqc61GrB7xU1OlTH1w5W_1PCKJJE4Pkk1nRdAVlcsDg1EZshdSJvzHqkJS8SlV1_A5icgii59WgGcXCVtVGUX2JJPpR2gZp" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see in the attack report that it successfully scheduled a job using `crontab`. Let’s mark the Unit as done in Swimm with the command `swimm done`. Just like the last step, you will be taken to a page that gives you more information about what changes you’ve just made.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gintBnsEcmxzAzpSPUnZfi8t1657nzb4b0votoNDt9C3sVe6MkR28hl_taR46cOsVwidaJ3imRdeV439FMYmQq6VLxTEe1k6AWR7Ct7bdLSC7SKEj7YdLxL1gjyozdSNewzooDeX" alt=""></p>
<p>This summary guides the person solving the Unit to read other parts of the code. Now that you have made some contributions, you are already more familiar with the lexicon, and manually tested your changes, you now have the context to figure out the code much quicker and improve your productivity when contributing to Infection Monkey!</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ue285WOS8WBBNqmcS6QndVxB1ZHrt2U_CzeKFqxRSqP-ylm-j5nmseJ1L6l-vVNCu2ZOvh68qJGynji0p6iEyOv8Ri5eFfKKi3yV3BH2ONLZ2E7eNccTyWx6Y9rvNo8kG4Z1t9eR" alt=""></p>
<p>Once again, Swimm will let you compare your solution to the original codebase. Now that you named the PBA and implemented it, the next step is to make sure that it actually shows up in the configuration. So, let’s move on to the fourth step, where you will be adding details about your PBA.</p>
<h2>Add Details About Your New PBA</h2>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_eTNZp-OGjYt84lmYqnQZR9_TB2QWd_I7X9T5i9cyLvDdi9vSt-2fdDdFvhdlPkG_REI1Iq9vSKoPzyACek-EqstoIe6FbZxj8wFgIhTPMf_NYUqZpyNKK0rSBiixcwsJ5mZ2bcO" alt=""></p>
<p>This is actually a pretty good example of how learning begets learning. Whenever you are trying to learn something new, you come across new terms, new terminology, and you look it up and research it. The MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique is something you will encounter a lot and you need to be ready for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework is an open-source knowledge base of attack tactics and techniques which were derived from real-world scenarios. This is something professionals in the cybersecurity industry refer to a lot." - Shreya Malviya</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this particular example, the “schedule jobs” PBA is related to two MITRE techniques that are shown in the description with their IDs. They basically do what the PBA does - scheduling jobs for Linux and Windows.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3mTHvCgEGmqJY6erSnouIhmtLugxxaCAJfOI56umZVBcgOypbl_12zUMzrtItPzrYFle2ClJwaPV74bK2k7egoJLUZTcGBTXh_QZPFNJlxGdqUBi6fnaY42VA54THouAaQtVzdka" alt=""></p>
<p>Here you can see a short recording of how the finder test should look so that it’s easier to ensure that whatever you’ve done is correct. Now, you …</p></div></div></section></div>

<p>"Deep Reckonings" is Stephanie Lepp's art project: she's created three deepfake videos in which three of the current moment's most clueless powerful monsters have a moral reckoning and make a clean breast of their failings.</p>

<p>First is Brett Kavanaugh, relating the evolution of his understanding of what sexual abuse means and his own history of sexual abuse, apologizing to the survivors of his crimes.</p>

<p>"Where I see the greatest untapped potential for prosocial synthetic media is in a capacity that emerges across all three categories: to envision and elicit the change we wish to see."</p>

<p>My latest Locus Magazine column is "Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Results," an essay about the limits of machine learning and the reason that statistical inference will not lead to consciousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/11/cory-doctorow-past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/">https://locusmag.com/2020/11/cory-doctorow-past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/</a></p>
<p>At its core, machine-learning is "theory free correlation-detection" – that is, it takes training data and finds things that appear together in it. Two things labeled an eye and one thing labeled a nose and one thing labeled a mouth all add up to a face.</p>
<p>But the classifier doesn't know what a noses, eyes, or mouths are. It doesn't know what a face is. Your doorbell camera doesn't know that the face-like thing in the melting snow on your walk <em>can't</em> be a face, so it repeatedly warns you about a stranger on your doorstep.</p>
<p>That theory-free-ness, combined with the abstruse mathematics of statistics, is what gets "AI" into so much trouble. Give machine learning classifiers of all the successful people at your company and it will tell you to hire people like them.</p>
<p>But if you've been missing great people due to bias, that is terrible advice – and it's got the veneer of empiricism. Remember when AOC got tons of shit from far-right assholes for calling an algorithm racist? How can math be racist?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/64621-how-algorithms-can-be-racist.html">https://www.livescience.com/64621-how-algorithms-can-be-racist.html</a></p>
<p>Theory-free isn't good enough. To understand what's happening in a complex situation, you haven't to be an anthropologist, not just a statistician. You need what Clifford Geertz called "thick description" – the qualitative accounts of the quantitative phenomenon.</p>
<p>Quantitative researchers are infamous for screwing this up. The qualitative elements are hard to do math on, so they incinerate them and leave behind a quantitative residue and do math on that, assuming it will be sufficient. It's (usually) not.</p>
<p>That's why exposure notification isn't contact tracing: knowing that two Bluetooth radios were close to each other for 15 minutes doesn't tell you if they were swapping spit or stuck in adjacent, sealed automobiles in a traffic jam.</p>
<p>Using theory-free inference to understand the world doesn't and can't lead to comprehension. "Theory-free" is the opposite of comprehension. We may not have a universal, agreed-upon definition of "artificial intelligence" but "understanding" is definitely a part of it.</p>
<p>Machine-learning classifiers have done amazing things to automate away a ton of drudgery, just as smiths did amazing things to shape metal. But smiths couldn't make reliable internal combustion engines. Incremental improvements in metal-beating don't evolve into machining.</p>
<p>Reliably turning out the precision components that produced engines needed casting and machining. Getting there required a shift in approaches, not improvement in the existing approach.</p>
<p>Theory-free statistical inference does a lot of good stuff – and produces a lot of bad outcomes – but the idea that if we do enough of it we'll get artificial intelligence is fundamentally wrong.</p>

<p>Amazon's ACX is a self-serve audiobook production platform:  writers spend thousands of dollars to produce audiobooks of their own work. Amazon strongly incentivizes ACX producers to sell exclusively through Audible (which also distributes to Itunes).</p>
<p>If you go exclusive, you get a better split of the proceeds – 40%. That's right: though you bore all production costs and Amazon has no costs associated with selling your audiobook, Amazon still keeps the majority of the revenue from it, even if you grant them exclusivity.</p>
<p>As unfair as that may sound, it gets a LOT worse. As part of its effort to lure customers to Audible, Amazon now grants no-questions-asked returns on audiobooks, and claws back the lost revenue from those returns from the audiobook creators.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales">https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales</a></p>
<p>Amazon's return policy is very generous: you can return an audiobook for a full refund for a full year after you buy it. When you finish the book, the Audible app even shows you a "return book" button. Hit it and you get a refund.</p>
<p>But Amazon won't tell its authors how many returns they're getting. The only way to estimate is to sell a book for a month, take it out of circulation the next month, and see how far below zero the book's net sales are in a month when it isn't even for sale.</p>
<p>If you sold 10 copies in April, take the book off the market, and "sell" -5 copies in May, your returns are probably 50%.</p>
<p>This is the system creators have bootstrapped because Amazon, the world's most aggressive retail data-collector, somehow can't provide this number.</p>
<p>These authors spend thousands of dollars though an Amazon self-publishing platform, then the company conspires with unscrupulous readers to confiscate their payments, making the system more attractive off the backs of creators.</p>
<p>And here's the sting in the tail: if you opt for "Amazon exclusive," you are locked in for <em>seven years</em>. Amazon silently made the switch to "no hassle returns" and clawed back half its creators' money, with no chance to opt out.</p>
<p>Amazon gets to change its deal with creators when it wants to, but the creators don't get to change their deal with Amazon. For seven years after they produce their own audiobooks, they are locked to Amazon, regardless of Amazon's policy changes.</p>
<p>Seven.</p>
<p>Years.</p>
<p>Audible controls 90% of the audiobook market.</p>

<p>Today on Xkcd, an "Election Impact Score Sheet" that turns on the theory that "reminders from friends and family to vote have a bigger effect on turnout than anything campaigns do."</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2380/">https://xkcd.com/2380/</a></p>
<p>It's a call to action: if you have friends or family PA, ME, AK, MT, NM, WI, MI, IO, NC, NH, GA, NE, MI, FL, KS, MI or CO, drop them a line today – text, call, email – and remind them to vote. Prioritize these calls in roughly that order.</p>
<p>If the people you reach need help with their plan to vote, refer them to a guide like this one, and help them work through it, figuring it out together.</p>
<p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/</a></p>
<p>If you remind two PA voters, the predicted impact on the election is as if you yourself had two votes.  For every 2.5 voters in AZ, ME or NE you remind, that's also predicted to shift the tally by one extra vote.</p>
<p>As the tooltip explains: "You might think most people you know are reliable voters, or that your nudge won't convince them, and you will usually be right. But some small but significant percentage of the time, you'll be wrong, and that's why this works."</p>

<p>I've been talking to Polygon's Tasha Robinson about my books for nearly two decades. She was one of the reviewers to dig into Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, my debut novel, all the way back in 2003 when she was at The Onion's AV Club.</p>

<p>She's always had smart things to say about my books (and is never shy about criticizing them) so I was delighted to talk with her about my latest, ATTACK SURFACE, for an interview: "Cory Doctorow on his drive to inspire positive futures."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Here’s a usability feature for the web: disable double-clicks on links and form submits.</p>
<p>Before you think I’m a complete idiot, allow me to talk some sense into the idea.</p>
<h2 id="the-double-click-outside-the-web">The Double-click Outside The Web</h2>
<p>Everywhere in the Operating System, whether it’s Windows or Mac OSX, the default behaviour to navigate between directories is by double-clicking them. We’re trained to double-click anything.</p>
<p>Want to open an application? Double-click the icon. Want to open an e-mail in your mail client? Double-click the subject. <strong>Double-clicks everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>Except on the web. The web is a single-click place.</p>
<h2 id="double-the-click-twice-the-fun">Double The Click, Twice The Fun</h2>
<p>We <em>know</em> we should only single-click a link. We <em>know</em> we should only click a form submit once. But sometimes, we double-click. Not because we do so intentionally, but because our brains are just hardwired to double-click everything.</p>
<p><strong>For techies like us, a double-click happens by accident.</strong> It’s an automated double-click, one we don’t really think about. One we didn’t mean to do.</p>
<p>For lesser-techies, also know as the <em>common man or woman</em>, double-clicks happen all the time. The user doesn’t have a technical background, so they don’t know the web works with single-clicks. Or perhaps they do, and don’t see the harm in double-clicking.</p>
<p><strong>But default browser behaviour is to accept user input. However foolish it may be.</strong></p>
<p>If you accidentally double-click a form submit, you submit it twice. It’s that simple.</p>
<pre>10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:06 +0400] "POST /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 0 
10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:07 +0400] "POST /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 0</pre>
<p>If you double-click a link, it opens twice.</p>
<pre>10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:06 +0400] "GET /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 9105 
10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:07 +0400] "GET /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 9104</pre>
<p>The problem is <em>sort of</em> solved with fast servers. If the page loads fast enough, the next page may already be downloading/rendering, so the second click of that double-click is hitting some kind of <em>void</em>, the limbo in between the current and the next page.</p>
<p>For slower servers, that just take more time to generate a response, a double-click would still happen and re-submit or re-open a link.</p>
<h2 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h2>
<p>I recently filed a feature request at <a href="https://www.nucleus.be/en">our</a> devs for a similar problem.</p>
<p>If you <em>accidentally</em> (and we’ve all done this) double-click a form submit, you submit it twice. That means whatever action was requested, is executed by the server twice.</p>
<p>The fix client-side is relatively simple, to disable the form submit button after the first submit was registered. There’s a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2830542/prevent-double-submission-of-forms-in-jquery/2830812#2830812">simple jquery snippet</a> that can solve this for you.</p>
<pre>$(document).ready(function(){
    $("form").submit(function(){
        setTimeout(function() {
            $('input').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
            $('a').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
        }, 50);
    })
});
</pre>
<p>Server-side, a fix could be to implement some kind of rate limiting or double-submit protection within a particular timeframe. <strong>Server-side, this is a much harder problem to solve.</strong></p>
<p>It’s 2015, why is this even a thing to consider?</p>
<h2 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>I can not think of a single reason why something like a form submit should have to be executed twice as a result of a <em>double-click</em>.</p>
<p>For a slow responding server, it’s reasonable for a user to hit the <em>submit</em> again after more than a few seconds have passed and no feedback has been given. Because of the lack of visual feedback that the request is still being processed, the expectation has been raised that the form submit did not work.</p>
<p>So the user submits again, thinking he must have made a mistake the first attempt. If the same form submit has been registered by the browser in less than 2 seconds, surely that must have been a mistake and would count as an <em>accidental double-click</em>?</p>
<p>Why should every web service implement a <em>double-click protection</em>, either client-side or server-side, and reinvent the wheel? Wouldn’t this make for a great browser feature?</p>
<p><strong>What if a double-click is blocked by default, and can be enabled again by setting a new attribute on the form?</strong></p>
<pre>&lt;form action="/something.php" allowmultiplesubmits&gt;
...
&lt;form&gt;
</pre>
<p>Setting the <strong>allowmultiplesubmits</strong> attribute causes the browser to allow multiple submits to the same form in the same page, and by default the browser has some kind of flood/repeat/double-click protection to prevent this.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m over thinking it and this isn’t an issue. But anyone who’s active on the web has, at one point, accidentally double-clicked. And I think we’ve got all the technology available to fix that, once and for all.</p>

November 4, 2020 | https://ncona.com/2020/11/introduction-to-google-cloud-functions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ncona.com/2020/11/introduction-to-google-cloud-functions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Cloud Functions are Google’s offering for serverless architecture (similar to AWS lambdas).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-serverless">What is serverless?</h2>

<p>Before we look into how to use Cloud Functions, we should understand some things about it.</p>

<p>Code needs servers to run, so <code>serverless</code> doesn’t mean there are no servers, it means that we don’t need to manage those servers ourselves.</p>

<p>In a usual server based architecture, we might create a service and deploy it to a machine. This service will be running in the machine all the time waiting for requests. This has the disadvantage that even if there are no requests, the machine would need to be up, and incurring cost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we use Cloud Functions, we write a service and register it with Google. Google will then listen to the endpoint this service cares about and will only start it when there are requests. If it detects that there haven’t been requests for some time, it will stop the service again.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>While Google Compute Engine instances are billed by time, Cloud Functions are billed by execution time. If a Cloud Function is not being executed, then it is not being billed. This sounds very attractive, but there are draw backs, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Running a Compute Engine instance for a full month is most of the time cheaper than having a Cloud Function executing for one month straight. This means that if we need a service to be always doing work, it’s better to get a whole machine for it.</li>
  <li>Cloud Functions need to warm up. If a Cloud Function hasn’t been used for a while, Google will stop the server that was running it. Next time we get a new request, a new server needs to be started, which takes some time. This will make this first request take long (This time varies a lot, but usually less than 4 seconds)</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, serverless shouldn’t be used in all scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-cloud-function">Creating a Cloud Function</h2>

<p>To make it easy to work on our Cloud Function, we need a way to run the function from our development machine.</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>mkdir test-functions
cd test-functions
go mod init test.com/functions
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can create a file for our function:</p>



<p>With this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>functions</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"net/http"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>DoYouLikeTacos</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprint</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"Of course I like tacos!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To be able to test our functions from our development machine, we need to create a server. Let’s create a file for it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>mkdir cmd
touch cmd/main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And add this content:</p>

<p>To run the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

go run main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the server is running, we can use curl to test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl localhost:8080/do-you-like-tacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>Of course I like tacos!
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example is very simple, but we can have our fucntion do whatever we want.</p>

<p>We can also add more functions by adding more files and updating our <code>main.go</code> server. Let’s create another function just to show it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>Run the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>And hit the new url:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl localhost:8080/thirsty
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="deploying-to-google-cloud">Deploying to Google Cloud</h2>

<p>Once we have our functions ready, we want to make them available to the public by deploying them to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>From the root of our project we can use this command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud functions deploy DoYouLikeTacos \
    --runtime go113 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will spit out a bunch of information. The most important part is the URL:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>httpsTrigger:
  url: https://us-central1-proj-1234567.cloudfunctions.net/DoYouLikeTacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can curl this endpoint, the same way we did for our local endpoint:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl https://us-central1-proj-1234567.cloudfunctions.net/DoYouLikeTacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a closer look to the command we used to deploy our function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud functions deploy DoYouLikeTacos \
    --runtime go113 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>DoYouLikeTacos</code> is the name of the function we are deploying. The tool will search the package for a function with that name.</li>
  <li><code>--runtime go113</code> tells google to use Golang 1.13. We can see the available runtimes in the help (<code>gcloud functions deploy --help</code>)</li>
  <li><code>--trigger-http</code> means that an http endpoint will be assigned to the function</li>
  <li><code>--allow-unauthenticated</code> means that the function will be available for everybody without authentication. Note that the function code itself could expect some kind of authentication independently of this flag</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a quick introduction to Google Cloud Functions. We learned how to create a function, test it locally and deploy it to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>Complete applications can be built using Cloud Functions, so I’ll explore a little more in another article.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <p>👉 <em>Looking for actionables and screenshots? Scroll to the bottom of this post.</em></p>

<p>I opened my smartphone’s “screen time” app for the first time recently and was somewhat troubled to discover that on a particular day a few weeks ago:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I unlocked my phone 64 times;</li>
  <li>I used my phone for over 3 hours;</li>
  <li>I received 145 different notifications (!).</li>
</ul>

<p>My first thoughts upon seeing these numbers: how much of this time could I consider as “time well spent”? How much of it could I redirect towards healthier activities?</p>

<hr>

<p>Let’s open up an imaginary toolbox for a moment. Imagine a screwdriver.</p>

<p>A screwdriver is a tool in its purest form. It does not ask for anything, does not require maintenance, and doesn’t distract from the task at hand. It just sits there, patiently waiting to be picked up when needed.</p>

<p><strong>A tool does its job, then gets out of the way</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of relationship I want with my smartphone. It should be tool, and nothing else. With that in mind, I set out to turn my smartphone into a tool again. This <a href="https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/tech-is-not-an-end-part-1">“tool, not distraction” mentality is useful for all kinds of modern technology</a>, not just smartphones. Cal Newport’s “Digital Minimalism” covers this idea pretty well too (<a href="https://maximevaillancourt.com/bookshelf/digital-minimalism-cal-newport">view my reading notes</a>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Picking up my smartphone happens in one of two mental modes: mindfully, or mindlessly. There are no other possible modes of operation when picking up a smartphone.</p>

<p>Mindful use is the best case scenario. Ideally, every single time I’d pick up my smartphone, it would be to resolve a problem, and I’d put it down the second I’d be done. That’s entirely reasonable, though it’s not always what happens. What’s more, it’s not very realistic.</p>

<p>Let’s focus on improving the “mindless” part: I noticed that when I mindlessly pick up my phone, it’s either because a notification came in, or because I’m bored. Knowing this, I now have a few points of leverage I can use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I can reduce the number of incoming notifications</strong> (reducing the total number of potential unlocks I attempt on the device);</li>
  <li><strong>I can make it more difficult to mindlessly unlock the device</strong> (leading me to really consider if I want to use it);</li>
  <li><strong>I can make sure I spend quality time on the device</strong> once it’s unlocked (encouraging me to do something better than falling prey to distracting apps).</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce incoming notifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Disable notifications for most everything</strong>. I have notifications enabled for PagerDuty, phone calls, and video calls. Nothing else, not even instant messaging or email. If it’s important, I’ll go look for it myself.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete social media apps and mindfully using them on the laptop/desktop instead</strong>. I used to scroll through Twitter every day on my smartphone before. I now use it a few times a week on my laptop.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce the number of mindless unlocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hide notifications entirely from the lock screen</strong>. This is good from a privacy standpoint and a mindfulness standpoint, as it limits the information exposed to strangers while preventing your curiosity from taking over.</li>
  <li><strong>Disable biometric authentication</strong> such as face and/or fingerprint unlock and instead <strong>use a strong passphrase</strong>. It’s much less convenient, so it acts as a mindfulness check.</li>
</ul>

<p>To spend quality time on the device once it’s unlocked:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Showcase useful apps on your home screen</strong>. For example, Duolingo, podcasts, Instapaper, Anki, Calendar, etc. You get the picture: not Facebook and Twitter.</li>
  <li><strong>Hide time-wasting apps</strong> from the home screen. Even better, delete them altogether! A first great step sis hiding them away in a folder of some sort.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable grayscale display mode</strong> to reduce the enticing effect of the apps icons’ bright colours.</li>
  <li><strong>Use an alternative launcher</strong> like <a href="https://jkuester.github.io/unlauncher/">Unlauncher</a>. You may even customize your launcher if you’re familiar with Java or Kotlin.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, the goal is to make it easier to use the device in a thoughtful, productive fashion than it is to use it for distracting purposes.</p>

<p>After these changes, screen time data for this week shows that on average I unlocked my device 11 times per day (~6x less than before), received 52 notifications per day (~3x less than before), and spent 70 minutes on the device per day (~3x less than before).  ✨</p>

<![CDATA[Clean Code – Notes]]>

November 3, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  The following is a list of notes taken on writing clean code, i.e. code that is maintainable and extensible.
</p>
<h5 id="names">Names</h5>
<p>
  Naming is the <i>hardest</i> and the most important part of writing clean code. Names should clearly express intent
  and the assumption here is that everyone involved in the codebase has the same cultural background which is not
  always the case in practice. Some general tips:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Classes should be Nouns, e.g. <code>User</code></li>
    <li>Methods should be verbs, e.g. <code>getById()</code>, <code>save()</code></li>
    <li>No need for prefixes such as <code>m_</code> or <code>str</code> for strongly typed languages</li>
    <li>Pick one word per concept, e.g. <code>fetch</code>, <code>retrieve</code> and <code>get</code> are
      semantically equal</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="functions">Functions</h5>
<p>
  Functions or methods are the fundamental building blocks of programming. In fact, the internal operation of
  programs normally consists mostly of functions pushing data onto and popping data off the stack as they call each
  other. Sometimes memory needs to be allocated on the heap for data that must survive across function calls.
</p>
<p>
  When a function is called, a <strong>stack frame</strong> is created to support the function's execution. The stack
  frame contains the function's local variables and the arguments passed to the function by its caller. The frame
  also contains housekeeping information that allows the called function (the callee) to return to the caller safely.
  The exact contents and layout of the stack vary by processor architecture and function call convention.
</p>
<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/call-stack-layout.svg">
      <img alt="An example of a call stack for the DrawLine function which is called by DrawSquare" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/call-stack-layout.svg">
    </a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An example of a call stack for the <code>DrawLine</code> function which is called by <code>DrawSquare</code>.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Some general tips on writing functions:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Functions should be small and they should do 1 thing only:
      <ul>
        <li>Only have 1 level of indentation - highly nested functions should be refactored into sub-routines</li>
        <li>
          <strong>No side-effects!</strong>
          <pre>public int sum(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b;
    resetGui(); // this is untestable and introduces a hidden dependency!
    return result;
}
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do not return <code>null</code> - caller will need to always check cluttering p code, consider using <i>special
        case</i> return values</li>
    <li>Don't pass <code>null</code> as a parameter value either</li>
    <li>Prefer exceptions for error conditions except in cases were a <code>Nullable</code> or <code>Optional</code>
      type is available</li>
    <li>Should ideally return a value, especially for monadic functions as this allows function chaining</li>
    <li>Fewer arguments are better - the more the arguments, the more the complexity and test cases that need to be
      written</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="oop">Object Oriented Programming</h5>
<p>
  An important but suble point to note in OOP is that objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose
  functions that operate on that data whereas data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions.
  Good OOP requires knowing when to use objects and when to use data structures. Consider the following example:
  </p><pre>public class Point {
    public double x;
    public double y;
}

public interface Point {
    double getX();
    double getY();
    void setCartesian(double x, double y);
    double getR();
    double getTheta();
    void setPolar(double r, double theta);
}
</pre>
    <p>
      In the second <code>Point</code> definition the co-ordinate system being used by the implementation is not
      known and need not necessarily be cartesian nor polar!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tips on writing clean OO code:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Classes should be small and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
        <li>Classes should have high cohesion, i.e. operate on a small number of variables</li>
        <li>Avoid using boundary interfaces, e.g. instead of returning a <code>Map</code>, wrap it in a class (<code>Sensors</code>)
          to encapsulate the implementation</li>
        <li>Comments should only be used for clarification or amplification - avoid in general and let the code
          do the talking!</li>
        <li>Prefer exceptions to error codes - error codes have the habit of spilling out into the entire
          system</li>
        <li>Use unchecked exceptions to not break encapsulation</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
      Finally, procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. OO
      code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change. Again, writing clean code
      requires insight as to when to use which style of programming.
    </p>
    <h5 id="tdd">Test Driven Development</h5>
    <p>
      Unit Tests should follow the F.I.R.S.T principle, i.e. they should be Fast, Independent of any external
      dependencies or manual setup, Repeatable, Self-validating (no manual checking verification) and Timely (run
      just before writing production code). Some general tips on writing clean tests:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Tests should be readable above all else and this might mean relaxing certain production code
          restrictions on performance</li>
        <li>Single concept per test</li>
        <li>Create helper methods to simplify complicated setups</li>
        <li>Convert multiple asserts into a single assert via a state pattern</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      The three laws of TDD:
      </p><dl>
        <dt>First law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write production code until you have written a failing test.</dd><dt>Second law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.</dd>
        <dt>Third law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.</dd>
      </dl>
    

    <div>
      <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/011-clean-code.jpg">
        <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/011-clean-code.jpg">
      </a></p><p>
        Not quite TDD.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h5 id="system-design">System Design</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Classes should follow the open-closed principle - open for extension but closed for modification.
          Consider the following example where we write an <code>AreaCalculator</code> which calculates the
          total area of a collection of rectangles.
          <pre>public class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<rectangle> rectangles) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Rectangle r : rectangles) {
            result += r.width * r.height;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</rectangle></pre> We would now like to extend this function to calculate the area of circles as well. Our new function now looks
          as follows:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape { }

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            if (s instanceof Rectangle) {
                Rectangle r = (Rectangle) s;
                result += r.width * r.height;
            } else {
                Circle c = (Circle) s;
                result += c.radius * c.radius * Math.PI;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre> Extending this further to calculate the area of triangles now requires another modification to the <code>calculateArea</code>
          method, i.e. it is not <strong>open for extension</strong>. We can change this by introducing an
          <code>area</code> method on the <code>Shape</code> data structure. Our code now looks like the
          following:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return radius * radius * Math.PI;
    }
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            result += s.area(); // note the simplicity
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Dependency Inversion Principle - depend upon abstractions and interfaces, not concrete
          implementations</li>
        <li>When building large software systems, try to avoid doing a big design up front - use a dependency

<p>For the first time, after a seven-year build, UKAEA’s £55M-machine, labelled <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/mast-upgrade/">Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) Upgrade</a>, has achieved “first plasma” – where all the essential components work together simultaneously.</p>
<p>The project at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy was funded by the Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences Research Council, part of UK Research &amp; Innovation and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy.</p>
<p>Fusion energy offers the potential of an abundant, inherently safe low-carbon electricity supply (the raw materials are found in seawater and the Earth’s crust). It involves fusing hydrogen particles in a hot gas known as a ‘plasma’ to unlock large amounts of energy.</p>
<p>Operating fusion technologies requires a careful balancing act of controlling extreme heat, gas and powerful magnetic fields, amongst other complex systems.</p>
<h3>Super-X factor</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in fusion research has been to extract the amount of excess heat from the plasma. UKAEA’s scientists now plan to test a new exhaust system called the ‘Super-X divertor’ at MAST Upgrade.</p>
<p>This system is designed to channel plasma out of the machine at temperatures low enough for its materials to withstand – meaning that components can last much longer. The approximate tenfold reduction in heat arriving at the internal surfaces of the machine has the potential to be a game-changer for the long-term viability of future fusion power stations.</p>
<h3>A step towards fusion power</h3>
<p>MAST Upgrade will be the forerunner of the UK’s prototype fusion power plant, <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/step/">Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (“STEP”)</a>, due for completion by 2040.</p>
<p>STEP – which UKAEA is designing in an initial £220 million programme funded by the UK Government – will be based on MAST Upgrade’s ‘spherical tokamak’ fusion concept. The spherical tokamak could offer a route to a compact fusion power plant. The success of MAST Upgrade is another step along the way to designing future fusion power facilities, which could have an important role as part of a future portfolio of low-carbon energy.</p>
<p>MAST Upgrade will also aid preparations for <a href="https://www.iter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITER</a> – the world’s largest science megaproject, now being built in the South of France, which intends to demonstrate fusion power on an industrial scale.</p>

<p>UK Science Minister, Amanda Solloway, said: “We want the UK to be a world leader in fusion energy and to capitalise on its amazing potential as a clean energy source that could last for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>“Backed by £55 million of government funding, powering up the MAST Upgrade device is a landmark moment for this national fusion experiment and takes us another step closer towards our goal of building the UK’s first fusion power plant by 2040.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the achievement of first plasma, UKAEA CEO, Professor Ian Chapman, said:</p>
<p>“MAST Upgrade will take us closer to delivering sustainable, clean fusion energy. This experiment will break new ground and test technology that has never been tried before. It ensures the UK is in the premier league of countries working on fusion – and will be vital in achieving UKAEA’s goal of building the STEP fusion power plant.”</p>

<section itemprop="articleBody">
<p>This summer I’ve been interning at <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, and have been writing a lot of Go. It’s been a bit of a change coming from a Haskell background, so I decided to write up my thoughts now, at the end.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<h3 id="incredibly-easy-to-pick-up">Incredibly easy to pick up</h3>
<p>There’s not a lot to Go, it’s quite a small language. I had never written a line of it before June, and now I’ve written about 30,000. It’s very easy to get started and become productive.</p>
<p>Haskell, on the other hand, is notorious for being hard to learn (<em>cough</em> monad tutorials <em>cough</em>). People often find it really hard to take the step from evaluating pure mathematical expressions to writing actual programs. I experienced no such disconnect in Go.</p>
<h3 id="garbage-collector-keeps-getting-better-and-better">Garbage collector keeps getting better and better</h3>
<p>Pusher previously tried to use Haskell for the project I was working on, but eventually had to give up due to unpredictable latency caused by garbage collection pauses. GHC’s garbage collector is <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/latency-working-set-ghc-gc-pick-two/">designed for throughput, not latency</a>. It is a generational copying collector, which means that pause times are proportional to the amount of live data in the heap. To make matters worse, it’s also stop-the-world.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/go15gc">Go’s garbage collector</a> is a concurrent mark-sweep with very short stop-the-world pauses, and it just seems to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.7#performance">keep getting better</a>. This is definitely a good thing for a garbage collected language. We did have some issues with unacceptable latencies, but were able to work them all out. No such luck with the Haskell project.</p>
<h3 id="style-wars-are-a-thing-of-the-past">Style wars are a thing of the past</h3>
<p>Say what you like about <code>gofmt</code>, but it makes arguments over code style almost impossible. Just run it on save, and your code will always be consistently formatted.</p>
<p>I do find it a little strange that <code>gofmt</code> has been completely accepted, whereas Python’s significant whitespace (which is there for exactly the same reason: enforcing readable code) has been much more contentious across the programming community.</p>
<h2 id="the-neutral">The Neutral</h2>
<h3 id="code-generation-seems-to-be-the-accepted-solution-to-a-lot-of-problems">Code generation seems to be the accepted solution to a lot of problems</h3>
<p>I am not a huge fan of code generation (and I say this as <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/go-interface-fuzzer/">the author of a code generation tool</a>). I think it can do good, but it can also obscure what’s actually going on. In every discussion on Go generics, someone will come along and say you can add generics with code generation: that’s true, but at the cost of introducing additional, nonstandard, syntax.</p>
<p>I suspect the strong culture of code generation is largely because it lets you work around the flaws of the language.</p>
<h3 id="strict-not-lazy-evaluation">Strict, not lazy, evaluation</h3>
<p>Strict evaluation is typically better for performance than lazy evaluation (thunks cause allocation, so you’re gambling that <a href="https://www.barrucadu.co.uk/posts/2016-02-12-strict-vs-lazy.html">the computation saved offsets the memory cost</a>), but it does make things less composable. There have been a couple of times where I’ve gone to split up a function, only to realise that doing so would require allocating a data structure in memory which before was not needed.</p>
<p>I could trust the compiler to inline things for me, and so optimise away the additional allocations, but in a lazy language you just don’t have that issue at all.</p>
<h3 id="the-standard-library-is-not-so-great">The standard library is not so great</h3>
<p>If you know me in person, it might seem a little odd that I specifically comment on this. Normally I am all for languages having a small, really well-written, stdlib and everything else provided through libraries. I am picking on Go here a bit because the standard library seems to get a lot of praise, but I was unimpressed.</p>
<p>Parts of it are good, a lot of it is mediocre, and some of it is downright bad (like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/">go/ast</a> package documentation). It seems a lot of Go’s use is in webdev, so perhaps those bits of the stdlib (which I haven’t touched at all) are consistently good.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>I also agree with this Quora answer by Tikhon Jelvis to <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-you-feel-that-golang-is-ugly">do you feel that golang is ugly?</a>, so have a look at that once you’ve read this section.</p>
<h3 id="a-culture-of-backwards-compatibility-at-all-costs">A culture of “backwards compatibility at all costs”</h3>
<p>In Go, you import packages by URL. If the URL points to, say, GitHub, then <code>go get</code> downloads HEAD of master and uses that. There is no way to specify a version, unless you have separate URLs for each version of your library.</p>
<p>This is just insane.</p>
<p>Go has a very strong culture of backwards compatibility, which I think is largely due to this. Even if you have a flaw in the API of your library, you can’t actually <em>fix</em> it because that would break all of your reverse-dependencies, unless they do vendoring, or pin to a specific commit.</p>
<p>Coming from the Haskell world, where the attitude is far more towards correctness than compatibility, this was probably the biggest culture shock for me. Things break backwards compatibility in Haskell, and the users just update their code because they <em>know</em> the library author did it for a reason. In Go, it just doesn’t happen <em>at all</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-type-system-is-really-weak">The type system is really weak</h3>
<p>A common mantra in Haskell is “make illegal states unrepresentable,” which is great. If you’ve never come across it before it means to <em>choose your types such that an illegal value is a static error</em>. Want to avoid nulls? Use an option type. Want to ensure a list has at least one element? Use a nonempty list type. Use proper enums, not just ints. etc etc</p>
<p>In Go you just can’t do that, the type system isn’t strong enough. So a lot of things which are (or can be) a <em>compile-time</em> error in Haskell are a <em>runtime</em> error in Go, which is just worse.</p>
<p>Let’s pick on some specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No generics</strong></p>
<p>Want to write a tree where every element is statically <em>guaranteed</em> to be the same type? Well, have fun implementing a “uinttree”, an “inttree”, a “stringtree”, and so on. You can’t just implement a generic tree.</p>
<p>But Go <em>does</em> have generics, for the built-in types. Arrays, channels, maps, and slices all have generic type parameters. So it seems that the Go developers want generics, but they don’t want to bother implementing it properly, so it remains a special case for a few things in the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No sum types</strong></p>
<p>The way in Go to handle possibly-failing functions is to have multiple return values: an actual result, and an error. If the error is <code>nil</code>, then the actual result is sensible; otherwise the actual result is meaningless.</p>
<p>This means you can forget to check the error and use a bogus result and, because there are no compiler warnings (another wtf), you will know nothing of this until things fail at runtime.</p>
<p>With a sum type, like <code>Either error result</code>, that just can’t happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No separation of pure code from effectful code</strong></p>
<p>It is very nice to know, just by looking at the type of a function, that it <em>cannot</em> perform any side-effects. Go’s type system doesn’t do that.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-tooling-is-bad">The tooling is bad</h3>
<p>Haskell gets a lot of criticism for bad tooling, but I think it’s worlds ahead of Go in some cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Godoc makes it really difficult to write good documentation</strong></p>
<p>Godoc groups bindings by type, and then sorts alphabetically. Code is not written like that, code is written with related functions in proximity to each other. The source order is <em>almost always</em> better than how godoc sorts things.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/7873">godoc doesn’t even support lists</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous proposals similar to this have been rejected on grounds that it’s a slippery slope from this to Markdown or worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that comment is particularly discouraging. Because the developers don’t like Markdown (and similar languages), they refuse to add even the most basic of formatting to godoc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is nothing like GHC’s heap profiling</strong></p>
<p>Go has a snapshot-based memory profiler. You can take a snapshot at a point in time, and see which functions and types are taking up the heap space. However, there is <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html#profiling-memory-usage">nothing like this</a>.</p>
<p>Being able to see not only a snapshot, but also how things have changed over time, is incredibly useful for spotting memory leaks. If all you have is a snapshot, all you can really say is “well, the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s looks a bit high, is that right?” With a graph you can say “the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s is increasing when it shouldn’t be.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is (was?) nothing like ThreadScope</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/ThreadScope">ThreadScope</a> is a tool for profiling performance of concurrent Haskell programs. It shows which Haskell threads are running on which OS threads, when garbage collection happens, and a bunch of other information.</p>
<p>If things are slower than expected, it’s great: you can see <em>exactly</em> how things are executing. Go doesn’t <em>currently</em> have anything like it, although towards the end of Dave Cheney’s <strong>Seven ways to profile Go applications</strong> talk at <a href="http://golanguk.com/">GolangUK</a>, he did whip out something which looked rather like ThreadScope (sadly, a video isn’t up at the time of writing, that I can see).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-values-are-almost-never-what-you-want">Zero values are almost never what you want</h3>
<p>Go avoids the issue of uninitialised memory by having “zero values”. If you declare a variable of type <code>int</code>, but don’t give it a value, it gets the value 0. Simple.</p>
<p>Except that that’s almost never what you want.</p>
<p>What is a sensible default value for a type? Well, it depends on what you’re using it for! Sometimes there isn’t a sensible default, and not initialising a value should be an error. You can’t define a zero value for your own types, so you’re kind of stuck.</p>
<p>Zero values caused so many problems over the summer, because everything would <em>appear</em> to be fine, then it suddenly breaks because the zero value wasn’t sensible for its context of use. Perhaps it’s an unrelated change that causes things to break (like a struct getting an extra field).</p>
<p>I would much rather:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the syntax for declaring a variable without giving it a value.</li>
<li>Make it an error to not initialise a struct field.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lots-of-boilerplate">Lots of boilerplate</h3>
<p>The cause of the lots of code generation, I feel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because you have to check error values, if you want to perform a sequence of possibly-erroring computations, where the successful result of one feeds into the next, there is a lot of typing. In Haskell, you’d just use the <code>Either</code> monad.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to sort a slice, because there are no generics, you need to wrap the slice in another type and implement three methods on that type. So that’s four lines of code to sort a slice of uints, four lines to sort a slice of uint8s, …</p></li></ul></section></article></div></div>
