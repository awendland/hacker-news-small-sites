<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Last time, we <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2020/12/13/shallow-trees-with-heavy-leaves/">briefly mentioned</a> the high-level differences between Stockfish and Leela Chess.</p>
<p>To recap, Stockfish evaluates about 100 million positions per second using rudimentary heuristics, whereas Leela Chess evaluates 40 000 positions per second using a deep neural network trained from millions of games of self-play. They also use different tree search approaches: Stockfish uses a variant of alpha-beta pruning, whereas Leela Chess uses Monte Carlo tree search.</p>
<p>An important recent change to Stockfish was to introduce a neural network to evaluate the positions in the search tree, instead of just relying on hardcoded heuristics. It’s still much simpler than Leela Chess’s neural network, and only slows down Stockfish to exploring 50 million positions per second.</p>
<p>The real cleverness of Stockfish’s neural network is that it’s an <strong>efficiently-updatable neural network (NNUE)</strong>. Specifically, it’s a simple feedforward network with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a large (10.5M parameters!) input layer, illustrated below, that can utilise two different levels of sparsity for computational efficiency;</li>
<li>three much smaller layers (with 17.5k parameters in total) which are evaluated densely using vector instructions;</li>
<li>a single scalar output to give a numerical score for the position, indicating how favourable it is for the player about to move.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is done using integer arithmetic, with 16-bit weights in the first layer and 8-bit weights in the remaining layers.</p>
<h3>The input layer</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by studying the first — and most interesting — layer. Here’s an illustration I made using Wolfram Mathematica:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png" alt="" width="640" height="760" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png 640w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial-253x300.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>The inputs to the layer are two sparse binary arrays, each consisting of 41024 elements. It may seem highly redundant to encode a chess position using 82048 binary features, but this is similar to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html">an approach</a> (called ‘feature crosses’) used in recommender systems.</p>
<p>What are the two sparse binary arrays, and why do they have 41024 features? My preferred way of interpreting these two arrays are as the ‘worldviews’ of the white king and the black king. In particular, the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinate systems:</strong> because black and white pawns move in opposite directions, the two players need to ‘see the board from opposite angles’. This already happens in regular (human) chess because the two players are seated opposite each other at the chessboard, so one player’s ‘top’ is the other player’s ‘bottom’. If you imagine each player numbering the squares from top to bottom, left to right, then any physical square would be called <em>n</em> by one player and 63 − <em>n</em> by the other player.</li>
<li><strong>Piece types:</strong> instead of viewing the pieces as black or white, a player sees it as either ‘mine’ or ‘theirs’. The 10 non-king piece types are thus {my pawn, their pawn, my knight, their knight, my bishop, their bishop, my rook, their rook, my queen, their queen}.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for these ‘player-relative coordinate systems’ is that it means that Stockfish can use the same neural network irrespective of whether it’s playing as white or black. The network uses <em>both</em> your king’s worldview and your enemy king’s worldview for evaluating a position, because they’re both highly relevant (you want to protect your own king and capture your enemy’s king).</p>
<p>So, why does each worldview have 41024 features? It can be seen as an outer product (or tensor product) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 64-element feature encoding the position of the king whose worldview this is, in their own coordinate system. This is ‘one-hot encoding’, where exactly one of the 64 entries is ‘1’ and the other 63 entries are ‘0’.</li>
<li>a 641-element feature encoding, for each of the 64 × 10 ordered pairs (square, piece-type), whether or not that square is occupied by that piece. The 641st element is unused, and is (according to the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">Chess Programming Wiki</a>) apparently a result of the network being ported from Shogi to chess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the two 64-by-641 outer product matrices* is then flattened (the matrix is ‘reshaped’ into a vector with the same entries) to yield the corresponding 41024-element ‘sparse worldview’. In the input layer, each of the two 41024-element sparse worldviews are then affinely transformed to form a 256-element ‘dense worldview’.</p>
<p><strong>*Important note:</strong> the 41024-element sparse binary arrays are never explicitly materialised, either as a 64-by-641 matrix or as a 41024-element vector. The Stockfish NNUE effectively ‘fuses’ the construction of these sparse vectors with the subsequent affine transformation (described below), updating the 256-element dense worldviews directly when the configuration of pieces on the chessboard is modified.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two levels of sparsity</strong> which are utilised when computing this affine transformation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B41024%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{41024}" title="\mathbb{R}^{41024}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B256%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{256}" title="\mathbb{R}^{256}">, allowing the network to be efficiently evaluated many times in a tree search:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 41024-element implicit vectors are themselves sparse: the number of nonzero elements is equal to the number of non-king pieces on the board.</li>
<li>moving a piece typically changes very few of the entries of the vector: if it’s a regular non-king move, only 2 entries change; if it’s a non-king move with capture, then 3 entries change.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s this second aspect which warrants the name ‘efficiently updatable’: when a move is made (or unmade, since we’re doing a tree search), we only need to add/subtract a few 256-element matrix columns from the resulting ‘dense worldview’ to update it.</p>
<p>Unless a king is moved, this (2 or 3 vector additions/subtractions) beats summing all of the matrix columns corresponding to nonzero entries (up to 30 vector additions), which in turn unconditionally beats doing a regular dense matrix-vector multiplication (41024 vector additions). That is to say, the second-level sparsity is about 10 times more efficient than the first-level sparsity, which is in turn about 1000 times more efficient than naively doing a dense matrix-vector multiplication.</p>
<p>The two dense worldviews are concatenated according to which player is about to move, producing a 512-element vector, which is elementwise clamped to [0, 127]. This elementwise clamping is the nonlinear activation function of the input layer, and (as we’ll describe) the hidden layers use a similar activation function. We can think of this as a ‘clipped ReLU’, which is <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/src/nnue/layers/clipped_relu.h">exactly what the Stockfish source code calls it</a>.</p>
<h3>The remaining layers</h3>
<p>The two hidden layers each use 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases. The activation function first divides the resulting 32-bit integer by 64 before again clamping to [0, 127], ready to be fed into the next layer. The output layer also uses 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases, but with no nonlinear activation function.</p>
<p>The first hidden layer takes 512 inputs (the clamped concatenated worldviews) and produces 32 outputs. The second hidden layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and again produces 32 outputs. The output layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and produces a single scalar output.</p>
<p>Since these subsequent layers are applied to dense vectors, they can’t use the same ‘efficiently updatable’ approach as the input layer; that’s why they’re necessarily substantially smaller. They can, however, use hardware vectorisation instructions (SSE/AVX) to apply the linear transformation and activation function.</p>
<p>This scalar output is then <a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=75506&amp;start=9">further postprocessed</a> using other Stockfish heuristics, including taking into account the 50-move rule which isn’t otherwise incorporated into the evaluation function.</p>
<p>Observe that the neural network doesn’t actually have complete information, such as whether a pawn has just moved two squares (relevant to <em>en passant</em>), whether a king is able to castle, and various other information pertaining to the rather complicated rules for determining a draw. This is okay: the network is only being used as a cheap approximate evaluation for a position; when deciding what move to make, Stockfish performs a very deep tree search and only uses this approximate evaluation in the leaves.</p>
<p>Equivalently, you can think of this as being a massive refinement of the approach of ‘look a few moves ahead and see whether either player gains a material or positional advantage’, using a neural network as a much more sophisticated position-aware alternative of crudely ‘counting material’.</p>
<p>This is a neural network, so the weight matrices and bias vectors of the layers were learned by training the network on millions of positions and using backpropagation and a gradient-based optimiser. Of course, for supervised learning, you need a ‘ground truth’ for the network to attempt to learn, which seems somewhat circular: how do you even gather training data? The answer is that you use the classical version of Stockfish to evaluate positions <strong>using the deep tree search</strong>, and use that as your training data.</p>
<p>In theory, you could then train another copy of the NNUE using the NNUE-enhanced Stockfish as the evaluation function, and then iterate this process. Leela Chess does the same thing: its current network is trained on positions evaluated by using deep lookahead with the previous network as the leaf evaluation function. Note that the construction of the training data is orders of magnitude more expensive than training the network with this data, as you’re doing thousands of evaluations of the previous network (owing to the deep tree search) to construct each item of training data for the new network.</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<p>The network is <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">described and illustrated</a> on the Chess Programming Wiki, which also has tonnes of references to forum discussions and other references. The first description of an NNUE was a Japanese paper by Yu Nasu (who suggested it for the board game Shogi instead of chess); the paper has <a href="https://github.com/asdfjkl/nnue">since been translated</a> into English and German. There’s also the Stockfish source code, which is very well organised (there’s <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src/nnue">a directory</a> for the NNUE) and clearly written.</p>

<p>Interestingly, public materials about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/drawbridge/">Drawbridge</a> variant used on SQL Server are few and far between.</p>



<p>So <a href="https://threedots.ovh/slides/Drawbridge.pdf">here</a> is a slide deck about me working with Drawbridge from several years back. I’ve updated parts of it later on, keeping up partially with more recent SQLPAL versions.</p>



<p>Since I made that slide deck, lots of things happened… which will maybe be a subject for a story or two some day.</p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I have seen a significant uptick of people posting or joining the forums and using belligerent language, making unilateral demands and insulting the process that is open source software. “The fact you haven’t done x is stupid”. “How can you write a piece of software that doesn’t do y?”. “It’s 2021 and you still can’t make a program do z, how pathetic”. Not exact words, but accurate sentiments.</p>
<p>Please don’t do this. Please be nice.</p>
<p>The Signal team, as with any open-source team, are not infinite resources to pour down the drain. Every hour they spend on their job working for Signal, every hour they spend after work helping out, every hour a volunteer puts into forum support and bug investigation, is an hour consumed. To receive insults and vitriol in return is corrosive. It is unfair and it is not in the spirit of giving, of making something and offering it for free.</p>
<p>You’re receiving this for free, this great software which is made by people who <em>literally care</em> about your privacy. They don’t know you, and they sure don’t know what you talk about on Signal, and yet they put in a lot of effort for this. Not to make wads of cash. Not to sell you to advertisers for your social life to be analysed and abused.</p>
<p>The developer for the Mastodon software Fedilab recently <a href="https://framagit.org/tom79/fedilab/-/issues/498" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">revealed he has been burnt out</a> and I’ve read elsewhere it was because people were screaming hate at him for a principle he upheld - which was that his software would not censor people screaming hate at each other. I’m sure you can appreciate the painful irony here. (Please note that his stepping down seems to be for real, the specific reasons I’ve gave are speculation). I, for one, chose his software specifically because it did not censor, because whilst I believe a service can censor if it chooses, software must remain neutral. (If you wish to discuss this, perhaps let’s do that on another thread).</p>
<p>Don’t be that person. Don’t jump on issues making demands. Don’t pile on forum threads that make some users’ opinions very clear as it is, and throw your bellicose howling in there too. Don’t insult the developers or their priorities, their choices. They are real people who have a finite capacity for work and for abuse. Add a thumbs up to an issue, add a heart to a forum request. Post only if you can materially add to the discussion, else use a reaction. Post in the spirit and the letter of the <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/guidelines">community guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Please be nice.</p>

<p>This is not cool, and you have kind of missed the point entirely.</p>
<p>As the post says, the people behind the non-profit app are spending time out of their days to help everyone get the best out of the app. Of late, with the influx of users requesting (and demanding!) features akin to WhatsApp and the other monstrosities, it’s likely to take its toll.</p>
<p>I appreciate what you are saying, to a degree. I also don’t think your post should be ‘hidden’ as it’s been reported by the Cancel-Culture-Community. I firmly believe that if you say something, you own that! As you will expect, people are entitled to reply to that to support or rebut. That’s called a conversation. So you shouldn’t be denied that. That said, the Community Guidelines are what they are. And if we disagree, we can chose not to participate.</p>
<p>In summary, the bottom line is being aware of the unkindness towards those trying to help. Berating developers for not having something featured isn’t likely to inspire ‘will’. Neither is your post. But then you have every right to say what you have said and others have the right to reply to it accordingly. In my opinion, anyway.</p>

          <p>Firstly. Thank you to Signal Devs. I think you’re all doing an amazing job and I will be signing up to donate, even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say to the Signal Dev Team. I bet that 99% of your user base appreciate all the hard work you are doing and want to support you in any way they can, myself included, even if just morally. Please don’t let that 1% of intolerant users discourage you from all the great input you have.</p>
<p>I am a great supporter of free speech even if something is “offensive” but posters must also realize the difference between <strong>“saying something offensive”</strong> and <strong>"hate speech"</strong></p>

<p>You might have the right to say what you want, but free speech isn’t about interrupting a conversation about football yelling about zebras. Free speech is about tolerance, about a productive and focused conversation –that’s why there’re guidelines, and why guidelines are there to be tolerated.</p>

<p>I was one of the flaggers. I am fine with someone disagreeing with me and refuting or rebutting what I’ve said. I even tolerate them doing so rudely if their points are salient. (A few hours later I usually come back and +1 their post with begrudging flouncing) If their first post on a forum is flaming someone without addressing a single one of their points in a coherent or sensible way, misrepresenting the letter and spirit of the conversation and acting generally in bad-faith, then I will flag that as it’s not a conversation, it’s just pointless screaming. If they also break the rules then they’re definitely getting a flag.</p>
<p>Flagging/reporting a post is not cancel culture at all. Flagging a rude, abusive or entirely unconstructive post is doing your bit as a member of the community to weed out bad behaviour and bad actors. I urge everyone to flag anyone posting in bad faith, or breaking the rules. Flag it all and let the pages written by people who detract from the conversation burn.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>The Mac has always been very different from its close relative, iOS, especially when it comes to what a user is or is not allowed to run on their system. Even with the introduction of Apple Silicon, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/?t=1161">has made it very clear</a> that the Mac is still the Mac, and is still <em>hackable</em>, even when running on the new architecture.</p><p>What this means for us developers is that, when targeting the Mac platform, we have choices: we can distribute our apps independently, outside the Mac App Store, through the Mac App Store exclusively, or through both at the same time.</p><p>This article is my brain dump on the subject. It is meant to be a guide on the things that you’ll need to know about when distributing a Mac app outside the App Store, rather than a how-to tutorial. My hope is that having everything listed here will help demystify the process for beginners, and the descriptions of my own process will be useful as starting points.</p><h2>App Store x Direct: pros and cons</h2><p>All of these choices come with their pros and cons, and depending on which type of Mac app you’re making, you might not be able to have it in the Mac App Store to begin with. An example of that is my app <a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/">AirBuddy</a> which, in order to provide deep integration with Apple’s wireless devices, needs to run a system agent and use some private APIs, which would never be allowed in the App Store. The same goes for many other types of apps which simply wouldn’t work with the restrictions of the Mac’s sandbox.</p><p>For those who do have that choice, I’ve compiled a list of what I believe to be the pros and cons between shipping through the Mac App Store or shipping directly.</p><h3>Mac App Store pros</h3><ul><li>Apple handles the distribution, billing and licensing for you</li><li>The app is easier to find and install for most users</li><li>Potential to get featured by Apple and reach more customers</li><li>Can use features such as Sign in With Apple which are not available for apps distributed outside the Mac App Store</li></ul><h3>Mac App Store cons</h3><ul><li>Have to pay a 15% or 30% cut of all sales to Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">depending on how much you make in a year across all apps</a></li><li>Every single update, no matter how minor, has to go through App Review and has the potential of being rejected for arbitrary and random reasons</li><li>Can’t unlock the full potential of macOS because of the strict sandboxing requirements</li><li>Can’t do paid upgrades</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution pros</h3><ul><li>Ship updates whenever you want, no need to wait for them to be reviewed and no fear of random rejections</li><li>Unlock the full potential of macOS with system extensions, daemons, no sandboxing, private API, and more</li><li>Keep a higher percentage of your sales</li><li>Do paid upgrades or other business models which are not allowed in the App Store</li><li>Live without the constant fear that your app will suddenly become a problem for Apple and be threatened with removal from the App Store</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution cons</h3><ul><li>Have to handle licensing, distribution, and updates (it’s not that hard, you’ll see)</li><li>Not as easy to do consumable or non-consumable in-app purchases (no StoreKit)</li><li>Can’t use some Apple services such as Sign in With Apple (others such as CloudKit still work just fine)</li></ul><h2>A note on Catalyst and SwiftUI</h2><p>With the introduction of Catalyst, we’re now seeing many new Mac apps being released, since it’s a lot easier to take an existing iPad app and turn it into a Mac app. Apps ported to macOS through Catalyst are not required to be released in the App Store, even if their counterpart on iOS is.</p><p>Additionally, there is currently no TestFlight for macOS (one of my wishes for 2021), so if you’d like to distribute beta builds of a Catalyst app, you’ll have to do that outside the Mac App Store, and it is not that different from distributing a production app.</p><p>A lot of what I’m presenting here will also apply for Catalyst apps — they’re Mac apps, after all — but some might require additional hacking in order to work around the fact that Apple doesn’t want you to use the entirety of AppKit directly from within a Catalyst app. With a bit of work though, you can make a Catalyst app very Mac-capable, including <a href="https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190607-Beyond-the-Checkbox-with-Catalyst-and-AppKit">support for AppleScript</a> and other features.</p><p>For SwiftUI apps targeting the Mac, there should be no major differences with the distribution process, since you can use all features of the macOS API in a SwiftUI app without requiring a lot of hacking like it does for Catalyst apps.</p><h2>Distribution</h2><p>Distribution of an app involves two parts: actually uploading, storing and serving the app binary and its updates somewhere, and also producing the right package that will work for your users.</p><h3>Hosting</h3><p>The first major step with getting your Mac app in the hands of users without the App Store is to figure out how to distribute its binary. No App Store means that you’ll have to host your app’s binaries and updates somewhere on the internet and provide a link for your users to download it.</p><p>There are several ways you can go about this. For an open-source app, you can use Github releases and even host your app’s update feed in the Github repo. That’s how I distribute the <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC/releases">WWDC app for macOS</a>.</p><p>For my commercial apps, I’ve been using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a> for storage of both the app binaries, delta updates and update feed, and proxying all requests through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> so that I can have a custom domain for the downloads/updates and also add filtering, caching and logic on the server if needed.</p><p>B2 is an extremely affordable provider (I rarely pay over US$1 in a month). Most Mac apps are not that large in size, so even if your app is downloaded a lot, it’s unlikely that you’ll end up having to pay a lot of money for storage/bandwidth. Another popular option is using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> buckets, but their control panel gives me nightmares so I prefer to use B2 which is a lot simpler (and less expensive).</p><p>I haven’t automated the publishing step for my app releases as of yet, so to upload a new release I just use <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> as a client for my B2 buckets. Speaking of that, before we even get to upload a release to whatever provider we’ve chosen, there’s a very important step: getting the right file to put out there.</p><h3>Notarization and packaging</h3><p>When exporting an archived app from within Xcode, we get two main options for distribution: App Store Connect and Developer ID. To distribute apps without the App Store, you’re going to be using Developer ID.</p><p>The same developer account you use for distributing apps to the Mac App Store can be used to sign your apps for Developer ID distribution. The certificate itself is different, but Xcode will auto-generate and install one for you during the process of exporting the archive if you haven’t done so yet.</p><p>Since macOS Catalina, all apps distributed directly to users must be notarized by Apple, otherwise they won’t launch by default. This process uploads your app to Apple, which will then run automated malware checks and “staple” your binary with a special signature that will allow it to run. This is not App Review, it’s an automated check to prevent malware from being distributed through this method, and it is also a way for Apple to flag a single binary for malware, instead of a developer’s entire account, should it become compromised at some point.</p><p>Whether or not you notarize the binary directly from within the Xcode organizer will depend on which packaging method you’ll be using to distribute your app. We can’t just upload a <code>.app</code> directory to a server and let users download that, we have to turn it into a flat file. The simple way to do that is to just zip the app and distribute it as a zip file, but I’ve found through experience that distributing the app as a DMG file reduces support requests by quite a bit.</p><p>You’ve probably seen DMGs before when downloading Mac apps. They’re disk images that are mounted by macOS when double-clicked in Finder, and they can also provide some artwork instructing the user to drag the app into their Applications folder. This makes it easy for a user to figure out what to do, and it also reduces the chances that a given user will be running your app from their Downloads folder or some other random place like that.</p><p>If you’re going to be distributing your app as a DMG, you should just export it using the Developer ID option in Xcode, without notarization, then notarize the DMG itself. There’s no option in Xcode to export a DMG, so you’ll have to use a third-party tool. The one I like to use is <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg">create-dmg</a>. I’ve also created and open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/dmgdist">dmgdist</a>, a tool that automates the process of creating, uploading and stapling the DMG so that you can get the image ready to be distributed by running a single command.</p><p>To distribute the app as a zip file, the process is simpler: pick the upload option from Xcode after selecting “Developer ID” and it’ll produce a notarized version of your app, which you can then zip up and distribute directly.</p><h2>App updates</h2><p>Another aspect of the App Store is that it also handles app updates. Whenever we upload a new version to App Store Connect and it gets approved, users receive the update in the App Store. For apps distributed directly, we need to replicate that somehow.</p><p>The best way to do that — and the most common — is to use <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a>. It’s been around for many many years and is pretty much the official way to distribute updates for Mac apps distributed outside the Mac App Store.</p><p>Sparkle is currently living a double life of sorts. You can either use the “legacy” version of Sparkle or use a more modern “v2” branch which includes many improvements such as the ability to update sandboxed apps. I still use the “legacy” version because it’s the one that I’m familiar with and I find that integrating the more modern version is still a bit more complicated. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p><p>The process of generating an app update usually goes as follows: ensure that with every update you increase the app’s version (of course), produce the package as described before (Sparkle can handle zips, DMGs and installer packages), then use the <code>generate_appcast</code> tool to update the feed. After doing that, upload the deltas, the package for the new version, and the updated AppCast …</p></div></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Over one year ago, I decided to quit my data science job and pursue my <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/">bootstrapped data science side-project</a> full time. It was a hard decision to make, but once I quit and was freed from the corporate nine to five, my life turned to complete bliss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That bliss lasted about two weeks before it reverted back to the mean. Honeymoons exist in all facets of life, and bootstrapping a business does not make you impervious to Mondays. Rather every day just became a Thursday. But more on that later...</p><p>I wanted to reflect on this past year plus of bootstrapping and add in some frameworks for why anyone reading this on the fence of quitting their job for their side-hustle should do so. Quitting was one of the hardest decisions that I had to make, but the best one I went through with. It's also a decision that many people should not do. </p><p>But for the small percentage of the people out there, bootstrapping a startup can be an awesome thing. You resign yourself to make trades. </p><p>You trade a steady stream of work and meetings for flexibility in your own time and hours. You trade your current monthly salary now for no income but with future options of money. And you trade office externalities and politics for taking full control of how your career might turn out. </p><p>And ultimately if those trades and values are worth it, then quitting your job can make sense in a very real way. </p><h2 id="how-it-got-started">How it got started</h2><p>On November 1st 2019, I officially quit my job as a data scientist at Nextdoor after working there for exactly a year. I had started a side project called Interview Query with my co-founder, Shane, six months prior. </p><p>Interview Query started out as an email newsletter that each day sent a user a data science interview question, and then the solution the next day if the user upgraded to premium. Over the past year we’ve built the product into a fully-fledged data science course, questions database, and became the de-facto data science interview prep resource.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png" alt="Interview Query SQL" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-18.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-18.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png 1364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example of a SQL interview question we would send out. If you paid for premium, we would send a detailed explanation + solution the next day.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The first time someone purchased a subscription in June of 2019, my co-founder Shane was convinced it was a stolen credit card. It took five more customers before he truly believed that we were not just a test platform for fraudsters. And we watched in fascination as our newsletter grew from $60/mo in revenue to $3,000/mo in revenue. <br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-19.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-19.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And while $3K/mo was a lot of money, it still wasn’t enough to constitute quitting our jobs. Shane was working part-time on it while also working a software engineering job. And I was also a pretty senior data scientist making <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-data-science-salaries">$160K/year</a>. So an apples to apples comparison of going from to $14K/month to $1.5K/month didn’t really seem worth it. </p><p>But direct income &nbsp;isn’t the only comparison you have to make. </p><h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h2><p>The hardest jump to make is almost always on money. Money has always had significance to me. I was born and raised as a Chinese American which meant money was and still is an intrinsic part of my identity. The comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KpLrHCAx0">Ronnie Chieng does a funny bit</a> on what money means to Chinese people.</p><blockquote>“Do you know what the direct translation of <em>Happy New Year</em> in Mandarin is? Hope - you - get - rich. <strong>That's not Happy New Year!</strong>"</blockquote><p>To my Chinese parents, they could have added an addendum of - <em>Hope you get rich while working a stable job with low risk.</em> For with all monetary pursuits, the equation that works best within typical Chinese American families is:</p><p><em>Current income * very stable job * years of working = <strong>Best Possible Outcome Ever</strong></em></p><p>It’s a pretty linear expectation of wealth that requires a normal day to day grind and the advantages of compound interest. But the equation never really took into account tweaking the risk factor. What happens when your current income drops and risk tolerance increases? </p><p>This was the pivotal question that made it difficult for me to quit. But a month before I ended up leaving, I met up with my old startup boss at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/monster-snaps-up-tinder-for-jobs-app-jobr/">company where we exited into an acquisition</a>. I told him about the dilemma I was in, and he illustrated a newer way of looking at it. </p><blockquote>If you have a product that’s making $3K/month and you can grow that into $5K/month in a few months by working full time on it, you have to realize that the <strong>actual added value of growing your business</strong> is turning it from $36K/year in revenue to $60K/year in revenue.<br></blockquote><p>This realization helped me understand the <strong>value investment of full-time work. </strong>Money and finances can be traded for time and investment in a business in ways that you can't when you work a job. Work your ass off for a year at any FAANG type of tech company and your boss will reward you with a 15% raise. Work hard on your business and double your monthly revenue after a year, <strong>well your business also just doubled in value. </strong></p><p>So the opportunity cost of trading a job that made me $160K/year didn’t seem that bad anymore if I could at least <strong>forecast a rate of growth that would be worth my time and investment</strong> as if I was working another full time job. </p><p>And at least on my own business, I’d enjoy the work. </p><h2 id="flexibility-and-values">Flexibility and Values</h2><p>Everything gets destroyed when you bulldoze a building. The walls, the appliances, even parts of the foundation. And while throwing a wrecking ball into the corporate 9-5 felt gratifying, picking up the pieces to rebuild <strong>exactly how I would work</strong> took just as much careful planning and thought. </p><p>Balancing structure and life is important when bootstrapping. A lifestyle business allows you flexibility in how you would like to run your business. Before I quit my job, I talked to a career coach (ironically employed by the company) who encouraged me to figure out my values - and try to see if quitting allowed me to prioritize them accordingly.</p><p>Eventually I realized it did when I wanted to re-prioritize my activity list from:</p><ol><li><em>Data science job</em></li><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Side-Hustle (Interview Query)</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li></ol><p>to</p><ol><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Interview Query</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li><li><em>Things I don’t want to do but have to do to make money</em></li></ol><p>This clear order of change in my lifestyle made me realize that valuing flexibility was extremely important. It was also something I couldn't attain in my day job.</p><p>For example, when an amazing swell approaches Ocean Beach now, I reschedule meetings, log off, and go surfing. Shane and I both have trust that I'm going to finish the work that needs to get done. But if I were to receive a meeting at my old job that conflicted or I didn't want to attend - there was no way around it. </p><p>As controllers of our own fate, we make it a priority to cut down all the things we don’t want to do, and hire for those roles. If we need vacation time, then we take it.</p><p>But on that note of flexibility comes the other way - how flexible can we be while still working? And how much did we really want to work in general?</p><h2 id="financial-independence-of-sorts">Financial Independence of Sorts</h2><p>In February of 2020, Interview Query was churning out a consistent $9K/month in revenue. We tripled revenue by increasing our distribution and had transitioned from the email newsletter to building a very simple interface for viewing all of the interview questions and solutions. It was also enough to now cover my rent and general expenses.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-22.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-22.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/image-22.png 1600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/image-22.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/bank-fraud-model">Our current interface - much improved from before</a></figcaption></figure><p>And better yet we still weren’t even working that much. I had taken a long vacation in New Zealand and Shane was still working part time. For a moment, it seemed like it was going to be a 4-hour work week kind of business that we could maintain without adding new product features. </p><p>But realistically, <strong>I had nothing else to work on</strong>. I still hadn’t gotten any of my other side-projects off the ground at the time. Surfing season was slowly ramping down. I looked around at what I was doing and realized that this project was the only one working and growing on its own. So why not invest to work on it?</p><p>One of my favorite ice breakers is asking people what they would do with their life if they received $10,000/month forever. Kind of like a basic<strong> </strong>(wealthy) income. Many people say travel (<em>which seems illogical given the extent of traveling for the rest of your life</em>), others say they’d make music, volunteer full time, work on making furniture, even working at a boba shop.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-20.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our New Zealand van!</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a thought experiment on the idea of financial independence (FIRE). And at its core, the question is asking about what you would practically do for the rest of your life if money wasn’t an issue. The current existence of career advancement is fueled by a never-ending competition in monetary and title status. But if those were all stripped away, what would be left to complete life satisfaction?</p><p>I realized there was nothing else I wanted to do but build a startup anyway. Of course money will always matter and I inherently want to grow the business bigger and bigger. But what happens when it’s just a question of: <em>what do I do with my time when my expenses are accounted for and I want to be productive?</em></p><p>Many people in the FIRE community seem to be at loss when they finally achieve their financial freedom. They grind at a job for 15 years to finally quit and reach the same elation that I felt for maybe a few weeks or even months to suddenly fall back into a depression of sorts. Their life has no purpose after hitting their number. Which makes sense, because for 15 years <strong>all they knew about was the grind</strong> and <strong>all they thought about was hitting their number</strong>.</p><p>I personally love startups and businesses. Building and running companies requires the experience and skillset to get better at doing so. And so the question posed that helped me understand things was: </p><p><em>Would you rather be completely financially independent at age X and then quit your job to try a startup, or get good at building startups now and be a complete pro at age X instead?</em></p><h2 id="buy-futures-in-yourself">Buy Futures in Yourself</h2><p>The first few weeks after quitting my job I enjoyed the classic freedom and flexibility I had …</p></div></section></div>

			<p>This is a tale of the intersection between thermal physics, cosmology, and a tiny
amount of computer science to answer a seemingly innocuous question: “How strong does
a password need to be for it to be physically impossible to brute-force, ever?”</p>
<p><a href="#conclusiontldr">TLDR</a> at the bottom.</p>
<p><em>Note: this post contains equations. Since none of the equations were long or
complex, I decided to just write them out in code blocks instead of using images or
MathML the way Wikipedia does.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I realize that advice on password strength can get outdated. As supercomputers grow
more powerful, password strength recommendations need to be updated to resist
stronger brute-force attacks. Passwords that are strong today might be weak in the
future. <strong>How long should a password be in order for it to be physically impossible
to brute-force, ever?</strong></p>
<p>This question might not be especially practical, but it’s fun to analyze and offers
interesting perspective regarding sane upper-limits on password strength.</p>
<h2 id="asking-the-right-question">Asking the right question</h2>
<p>Instead of predicting what tomorrow’s computers may be able to do, let’s examine the
<em>biggest possible brute-force attack</em> that the laws of physics can allow.</p>
<p>A supercomputer is probably faster than your phone; however, given enough time, both
are capable of doing the same calculations. If time isn’t the bottleneck, energy
usage is. More efficient computers can flip more bits with a finite amount of energy.</p>
<p>In other words, energy efficiency and energy availability are the two fundamental
bottlenecks of computing. What happens when a computer with the highest theoretical
energy efficiency is limited only by the mass-energy of <em>the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe">observable
universe</a>?</em></p>
<p>Let’s call this absolute unit of an energy-efficient computer the MOAC (Mother of All
Computers). For all classical computers that are made of matter, do work to compute,
and are bound by the conservation of energy, the MOAC represents a finite yet
unreachable limit of computational power. And yes, it can play Solitaire with
<em>amazing</em> framerates.</p>
<p>How strong should your password be for it to be safe from a brute-force attack by the
MOAC?</p>
<h3 id="quantifying-password-strength">Quantifying password strength.</h3>
<p>A good measure of password strength is <strong>entropy bits.</strong> The entropy bits in a
password is a base-2 logarithm of the number of guesses required to brute-force
it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A brute-force attack that executes 2<sup>n</sup> guesses is certain to crack a
password with <em>n</em> entropy bits, and has a one-in-two chance of cracking a password
with <em>n</em>+1 entropy bits.</p>
<p>For scale, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>
encryption is currently the industry standard for strong symmetric encryption. As the
name suggests, its keys have 256 bits of entropy; if your password has more than 256
entropy bits, then the AES-256 encryption algorithm is the bottleneck.</p>
<p>To calculate the entropy of a password, I recommend using a tool such as
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler">zxcvbn</a>
or <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Define a function <code>P</code>. <code>P</code> determines the probability that MOAC will correctly guess
a password with <code>n</code> bits of entropy after using <code>e</code> energy:</p>
<pre><code>P(n, e)
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>P(n, e) ≥ 1</code>, the MOAC will certainly guess your password before running out of
energy. The lower <code>P(n, e)</code> is, the less likely it is for the MOAC to guess your
password.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-and-estimates">Caveats and estimates</h2>
<p>I don’t have a strong physics background.</p>
<p>When estimating, we’ll prefer higher estimates that increase the odds of it guessing
a password; after all, the point of this exercise is to establish an <em>upper</em> limit on
password strength. We’ll also simplify: for instance, the MOAC will not waste any
heat, and the only way it can guess a password is through brute-forcing. Focusing on
too many details would defeat the point of this thought experiment.</p>
<p>I won’t address any particular encryption algorithms; this is just a pure and simple
brute-force attack given precomputed password entropy. Furthermore, quantum computers
can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> for
an exponential speed-up; to account for quantum computers using Grover’s algorithm,
calculate <code>P(n/2, e)</code> instead.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’m not taking into account future mathematical advances; my crystal ball
broke after I asked it if humanity would ever develop the technology to make anime
real.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s always a non-zero probability of a brute-force attack guessing a
password with a given entropy. Literal “immunity” is impossible. Lowering this
probability to statistical insignificance renders our password practically immune to
brute-force attacks.</p>
<h2 id="computation">Computation</h2>
<p>How much energy does MOAC use per guess during a brute-force attack? In the context
of this thought experiment, this number should be unrealistically low. I settled on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_(energy)"><code>kT</code></a>. <code>k</code> represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant">Boltzmann
Constant</a> (about
1.381×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K) and <code>T</code> represents the temperature of the system. Their
product corresponds to the amount of heat required to create a 1 nat increase in a
system’s entropy.</p>
<p>A more involved approach to picking a good value might utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%E2%80%93Einstein_relation">Plank-Einstein
relation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also probably a better idea to make this value an estimate for flipping a single
bit, and to estimate the average number of bit-flips it takes to make a single
password guess. If that bothers you, pick a number <code>b</code> you believe to be a good
estimate for a bit-flip-count and calculate <code>P(n-b, e)</code> instead of <code>P(n, e)</code>.</p>
<p>What’s the temperature of the system? Three pieces of information help us find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MOAC is located somewhere in the observable universe</li>
<li>The MOAC will be consuming the entire observable universe</li>
<li>The universe is mostly empty</li>
</ol>
<p>A good value for <code>T</code> would be the average temperature of the entire observable
universe. The universe is mostly empty; <code>T</code> is around the temperature of cosmic
background radiation in space. The lowest reasonable estimate for this temperature is
2.7 degrees Kelvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A lower temperature means less energy usage, less energy
usage allows more computations, and more computations raises the upper limit on
password strength.</p>
<p>Every guess, the MOAC expends <code>kT</code> energy. Let <code>E</code> = the total amount of energy the
MOAC can use; let <code>B</code> = the maximum number of guesses the MOAC can execute before
running out of energy.</p>
<pre><code>B = E/(kT)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, given the maximum number of passwords the MOAC can guess <code>B</code> and the bits of
entropy in our password <code>n</code>, we have an equation for the probability that the MOAC
will guess our password:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,B) = B/2ⁿ
</code></pre>
<p>Plug in our expression for <code>B</code>:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="calculating-the-mass-energy-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the mass-energy of the observable universe</h3>
<p>The MOAC can use the entire mass-energy of the observable universe.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Simply stuff
the observable universe into the attached 100% efficient furnace, turn on the burner,
and generate power for the computer. You might need to ask a friend for help.</p>
<p>Just how much energy is that? The mass-energy equivalence formula is quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>E = mc²
</code></pre>
<p>We’re trying to find <code>E</code> and we know <code>c</code>, the speed of light, is 299,792,458 m/s.
That leaves <code>m</code>. What’s the mass of the observable universe?</p>
<h3 id="calculating-the-critical-density-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the critical density of the observable universe</h3>
<p>Critical density is smallest average density of matter required to <em>almost</em> slow the
expansion of the universe to a stop. Any more dense, and expansion will stop; any
less, and expansion will never stop.</p>
<p>Let <code>D</code> = critical density of the observable universe and <code>V</code> = volume of the
observable universe. Mass is the product of density and volume:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>We can derive the value of D by solving for it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations">Friedman
equations</a>:</p>
<pre><code>D = 3Hₒ²/(8πG)
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>G</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">Gravitational
Constant</a> and <code>Hₒ</code> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Hubble Constant</a>. <code>Hₒd</code> is the rate of
expansion at proper distance <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the observable universe is a sphere, expanding at the speed of light
ever since the Big Bang.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The volume <code>V</code> of our spherical universe when given its
radius <code>r</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>V = (4/3)πr³
</code></pre>
<p>To find the radius of the observable universe <code>r</code>, we can use the age of the universe
<code>t</code>:</p>
<pre><code>r = ct
</code></pre>
<p>Hubble’s Law estimates the age of the universe to be around <code>1/Hₒ</code></p>
<h3 id="solving-for-e">Solving for E</h3>
<p>Let’s plug in all the derived values into our original equation for the mass of the
observable universe <code>m</code>:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>Remember when I opened the article by saying that none of the equations would be long
or complex?</p>
<p>I lied.</p>
<pre><code>m = (3Hₒ²/(8πG))(4/3)π(ct)³
m = c³/(2GHₒ)

E = mc²
E = c⁵/(2GHₒ)
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, we found an expression for the total energy the MOAC can consume!</p>
<h2 id="final-solution">Final Solution</h2>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
P(n, c⁵/(2GHₒ)) = c⁵/(2GHₒ*2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s copy and paste the values for those constants from Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha:</p>
<ul>
<li>c = 299,792,458 m/s</li>
<li>G ≈ 6.67408×10<sup>-11</sup> m³/kg/s²</li>
<li>Hₒ ≈ 2.2×10<sup>-18</sup> Hz (uncertain; look up the Hubble tension)</li>
<li>T ≈ 2.7 K</li>
<li>k ≈ 1.3806503×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugging those in and simplifying:</p>
<p><strong>P(n) ≈ 2.21×10<sup>92</sup> / 2<sup>n</sup></strong></p>
<p>Here are some sample outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>P(256) ≈ 1.9×10<sup>15</sup> (password certainly cracked after burning 1.9
quadrillionth of the mass-energy of the observable universe).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(306.76) ≈ 1 (password certainly cracked after burning the mass-energy of the
observable universe)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(310) ≈ 0.11 (about one in ten)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(326.6) ≈ 1.1×10<sup>-6</sup> (about one in a million)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your threat model is a bit smaller, simulate putting a smaller object into the
MOAC’s furnace. For example, the Earth has a mass of 5.972×10²⁴ kg; this gives the
MOAC a one-in-ten-trillion chance of cracking a password with 256 entropy bits and a
100% chance of cracking a 213-bit password.</p>
<h2 id="sample-unbreakable-passwords">Sample unbreakable passwords</h2>
<p>According to KeePassXC’s password generator, each of the following passwords has an
entropy between 330 and 340 bits.</p>
<p>Using the extended-ASCII character set:</p>
<pre><code>¦=¦FVõ)Çb^ÄwÎ¡=,°m°B9®;&gt;3[°r:t®Ú"$3CG¨/Bq-y\;
</code></pre>
<p>Using the characters on a standard US QWERTY layout:</p>
<pre><code>%nUzL2XR&amp;Tz5hJfp2tiYBoBBX^vWo3`g6H#JSC#N6gWm#hVdD~ziD$YHW
</code></pre>
<p>Using only alphanumeric characters:</p>
<pre><code>tp8D69CGWE5t5a9si5XNsw32CKyCafh8qGrKWLwE6KJHpGyUtcJDWpgRz5mFNx
</code></pre>
<p>An excerpt from a religious text with a trailing space:</p>
<pre><code>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, 
</code></pre>
<p>Don’t use actual excerpts from pre-existing works as your password.</p>
<h2 id="conclusiontldr">Conclusion/TLDR</h2>
<p>Question: How much entropy should a password have to ensure it will <em>never</em> be
vulnerable to a brute-force attack? Can an impossibly efficient computer–the
MOAC–crack your password?</p></section></article></div>

										<span>This is The Entire Computer Science Curriculum in 1000 YouTube Videos</span>
			
														
						
						<div>
				<p><span>In this article, we are going to create an entire Computer Science curriculum using only YouTube videos. The Computer Science curriculum is going to cover every skill essential for a Computer Science Engineer that has expertise in Artificial Intelligence and its subfields, like: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, etc.</span></p>
<p>The curriculum is going to be organized in 40 courses in total, further organized in 4 academic years, each containing 2 semesters.</p>
<p>We are going to try to list a few videos per course as we can, so we can keep the list short.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to capture the whole university experience in perspective of the organization of the courses and deliver you the whole curriculum for FREE, so you can gain significant knowledge.</p>
<p>We know that this is not the same as you’ll get at university, but the videos are of high quality, and most of them helped us, during our time at university.</p>
<p>We hope you will like it, and it will be of use to you.</p>
<p>As of today, we’ve seen that most of the visitors on our website, like the articles where we talk about free courses, curriculums, books, etc. Some of our most popular articles in that area are:</p>

<h2><strong>Whole Computer Science Curriculum in 40 YouTube Videos</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Year 1: </strong><strong>Semester 1</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Structured Programming (Programming in C)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to <a href="http://laconicml.com/machine-learning-weka/">programming</a>. It will help you write your first code, run your first application, and see what programming is about. You will start with printing messages on the screen, simple arithmetic operations, if-else statements, loops, data structures (arrays, matrices), memory addresses, pointers, reading and writing files, etc. You will build simple applications that will allow you to understand the material even better. The best two videos that we recommend for this course are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C Programming Tutorial For Beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CpG3oATGIs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C Programming Tutorial | Learn C programming | C language</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 1</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to declarative statements, sets, and operations with sets, laws, logic, quantifiers, functions, proofs, sequences, and summation. For this course, and it’s a second part which we’ve put in Year 2, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 YouTube videos, but we are going to split it, 34 videos for part 1 (1-34) and 26 videos for the part 2 (35-60).</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 1-34)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Calculus part 1</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to limits, intervals, differentiability, continuity, derivatives, antiderivatives, rules, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, optimizations, and sums. It will be a huge help to you, once you dive into the later semesters of your studies and will help you understand most of the <a href="http://laconicml.com/mathematical-skills-data-scientist/">mathematics</a> behind Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc. Here we will suggest you take look at this list of 86 videos. Yes, it looks long, but the videos are quite short and well explained.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1ml6mys-RXoQ0O3GfwBPVM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 1 playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to computer science and programming from a theoretical view. It is very important for every beginner to have a visual representation in its mind about most of the concepts of computer science and programming. That way, it can understand their complexity and unlock its imagination and creativity and use the full power of computer science and programming while respecting their laws. Here we recommend you this video:</p>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zOjov-2OZ0E" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Intro to Python Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is an introduction to Python programming. Easily one of the most popular programming languages in the world, <a href="http://laconicml.com/implement-bayesian-regression-python/">Python</a> is widely used by many people who work in some sort of IT-related field. It is easy to understand, use has tons of libraries and it has huge community support. It is used in Web Development (Django, Flask), Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow), etc. You are going to use Python a lot, so for this course, we are going to keep it simple by recommending only one video:</p>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfscVS0vtbw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>





<h2><strong>Semester 2</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Calculus part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the second part of the Calculus. Here you are going to learn about integrals, series, tests, polar coordinates, polar graphs, etc. For this course, we are going to recommend you this playlist of 64 videos. It looks like a lot, but the videos are well explained and are quite short, so you feel like you’ve covered a lot of material.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1OxI-BbNkEhuwPHcKxuPSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 2 playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to matrices, graphs, searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, algorithms complexity, introduction to probability, combinatorics, variations, and permutations.</p>
<p>This is the second part of the Discrete Mathematics, and as we’ve mentioned in the first part, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 videos, but here we are going to watch starting from the 35th up to the 60th video.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 35-60)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce me to C++, starting from the basics, up to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is one of the main programming paradigms, and probably the most used.</p>
<p>Most of the applications that you have on your mobile phone or access from the browser are programmed following this paradigm.</p>
<p>It is the pillar of every program you will write in the future, so you will want to give this course more time. For this course, we will recommend you a video playlist of 29 videos.</p>
<p>However, we recommend you to watch them up to the 13th because the rest of them are beyond OOP and if you are new to this, might be complex and difficult to understand.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvQ9S8YSV0iDsuEU8v11yP9M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++ tutorial playlist (videos: 1-13)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Computer System Architecture</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this course, you are going to be introduced to set design, processor micro-architecture and pipelining, cache and virtual memory organizations, protection and sharing, I/O and interrupts, in-order and out-of-order superscalar architectures, VLIW machines, vector supercomputers, multithreaded architectures, symmetric multiprocessors, and parallel computers. For this course, we will recommend you the following playlist coming from <a href="http://laconicml.com/computer-science-engineer-mit-university/">MIT</a>. The list has 39 videos, that are quite long</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PHm2jkkXmi5CxxI7b3JCL1TWybTDtKq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Systems Architecture full playlist</a></li>
</ol>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLP_X4wyHbY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Web Design (HTML + CSS)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is your introduction to what one stage of web development (the front-end) looks like. You are going to get familiar with HTML, which is the markup language that makes the elements we see on a webpage, and with CSS, which is a stylesheet that gives life to those elements. Here we recommend two videos, one for HTML and one for CSS.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&amp;ab_channel=TraversyMedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML Crash Course For Absolute Beginners</a></li>

</ol>
<p>This course is one of the most important courses for every Computer Science Engineer who wants to be an expert in <a href="http://laconicml.com/free-artificial-intelligence-courses-by-google/">Machine Learning</a>. The course consists of intro to probability, combinatorics, variations, permutations, distributions, etc.</p>
<p>The playlist that we’ve recommended is from Khan’s Academy. It contains 41 videos that are 10 minutes long at max, and are very interesting, and contain tons of practical examples.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC58778F28211FA19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Probability playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Statistics</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the other most important courses if you want to do Machine Learning in the future. The course will get you familiar with the main statistical features, hypothesis testing, levels of measurements, etc. The playlist that we recommend contains 28 videos, which are quite long.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5102DFDC6790F3D0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statistics playlist</a></li>

<p>Live chat (Slack, Teams, etc.) sucks for important discussions.</p>



<p>Thinking one line at a time lowers the quality of the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/01/08/discussion-topics-for-development-teams/">discussion</a>. Knee jerk rapid fire responses become the norm.</p>



<p>Conversations that last weeks or even days get lost and context gets fuzzy. Threads scroll up into the past and are never seen again.</p>



<p>Despite the “asychronous” claim, you have to <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/09/05/the-chatodoro-breaking-the-group-chat-addiction/">keep a steady eye on it</a> and reply in realtime or the conversation will move on without you. Anyone who takes the time to ponder and respond thoughtfully with context and explanation will find that they’re too late. </p>



<p>If you go on vacation or even take a few hours of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/13/heads-down-tuesday/">focused time for deep work</a>, you come back to hundreds or thousands of messages. Often your only option is to declare chat room <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">bankruptcy</a> which means missing out on important discussions and big decisions.</p>



<p>I’m not saying live chat is useless. It’s great at some things:</p>



<ul><li>Quick answers to quick questions</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">Low-stakes status updates</a></li><li>Swarming around <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/14/making-the-most-of-post-mortems/">red alerts or outages</a></li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">Fun and belonging</a> (especially for remote workers)</li></ul>



<p>In other words, <strong>live chat is for the things that can get lost.</strong> </p>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/07/a-simple-process-beats-a-perfect-process/">Rule of thumb</a>: <em>If a discussion will matter after today, don’t have it in a chat room.</em> Check out <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, <a href="https://twist.com/">Twist</a>, <a href="https://carrot.io/">Carrot</a>, <a href="https://threads.com/">Threads</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://flarum.org/">Flarum</a>, or heck even GitHub issues. These tools exist for a reason. They solve a real problem.</p>



<ul><li>They encourage longer form responses rather than quick one liner replies. </li><li>They show you a list of threads <em>with titles</em> for maximum <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">skim-ability</a>. </li><li>They let you sort (by last comment, for example) and filter threads or archive them once a decision has been reached. </li><li>They don’t show online/offline indicators or timezone notifications or “XYZ is typing…” because nobody expects a quick response anyway.</li><li>Some of them even support multi-level (Reddit-style) threading, which can help if a lot of people are involved.</li></ul>



<p>Try it as <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">an experiment</a>. For one sprint, ask if your team will put anything that matters after today in a discussion tool instead of a chat room. Then see if they want to switch back after the sprint ends.</p>

As the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths climbed during 2020 and reached new heights in 2021, search volumes for Covid-related terms, specifically “cases” and “deaths,” have not followed suit. One might think that concern about the pandemic, measured through these metrics, would closely follow the severity of the disease. Instead, we are seeing just the opposite: people’s interest has, if anything, declined as the disease has intensified. Why is this and how might it be affecting our response to the pandemic?</p>

<div><p>As the U.S. trudges through the deadliest period of the pandemic so far, The Factual set out to explore why Americans seemingly care less and less about a disease that is killing thousands prematurely every day. We reviewed 31 articles from 26 sources across the political spectrum to examine human responses to immense suffering and why American’s may be numb to the ongoing impacts of Covid-19.</p></div>

<p>More than 370,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, with the daily death toll at its highest yet in recent days. On January 7 alone, 4,112 Americans died. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 standard 737s crashing in a single day, each <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/why-minds-brains-cannot-make-sense-coronavirus-enormous-death-toll/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>loaded with 138 people</span></a>. It’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more American deaths</span></a> than from D-Day in 1944 and more than from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. No matter how we split up and conceptualize these numbers — a tactic journalists use to make impacts <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more tangible</span></a> — we fail to capture each of the individuals that these statistics include.</p>
<p>As thousands die, Americans are seemingly paying less attention. According to Google’s tracking mechanism for online searches, Google Trends, interest in “cases” and “deaths” <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>peaked</span></a> the week of March 22, when cases were <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalandratecases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rapidly surpassing</span></a> the 100,000 mark but fewer than 50 Americans had died. (The search terms are closely linked, but not exclusive, to the Covid-19 pandemic.) Smaller peaks appear the week of June 21 and, to a lesser degree, in the weeks prior to Thanksgiving — times when warnings were abound about an impending spike in cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the subsequent peaks in Covid-19 deaths, and now, with more than 2,000 deaths every day for the last month, searches for these terms have failed to match the severity of the disease (note, however, that searches for “covid” generally have been consistent with trends in severity). For example, searches for "cases" and "deaths" are now at roughly a quarter of their March and April 2020 peaks, even as 10 times as many cases appear every day and twice as many people die.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This counterintuitive divergence seems to be explained by a combination of psychological, political, and demographic factors. However, at the very least, our inability to comprehend such widespread death continues to undermine our pandemic response.</p></div>

<div><p>Note: Searches are measured on a scale of 1 to 100 from January 12, 2020 to January 9, 2021. 100 represents the highest number of searches in a given week over the time period.<br>Source: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-12%202021-01-09&amp;geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Google Trends</span></a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our World in Data</span></a></p></div>
<h4><strong>Psychological Factors</strong></h4>
<p>The most common explanations have to do with human psychology and the way we think about problems. For starters, humans have a hard time <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>comprehending large numbers</span></a> and tend to downplay risk even as the numbers, and risk, increase exponentially. This inability to appreciate larger numbers plays out through “psychic numbing,” a phenomena which suggests that humans are far more impacted and attuned to first instances of danger but grow <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less worried</a> as the numbers increase and the threat is prolonged. For example, the difference between no one dying and one person dying is quite large, but the difference between the 100th and 101st death is far less impactful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As evidence, scientists have shown that focusing on individuals and personal suffering, rather than large numbers, is much more effective at attracting interest and attention. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Popularly cited examples</span></a> come from experiments like those conducted by Paul Slovic, a professor at the University of Oregon, who identified that people are far more likely to donate to help a single starving child than to help successively larger groups of children. Human behavior is prone to connect to individuals and circumstances where we feel we can have an impact. Increasing the number of people dilutes our ability to connect and our perceived ability to make a difference. This effect can be seen elsewhere, such as with <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/08/why-dont-dead-matter/167840/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>wars</span></a> and genocides. Slovic’s work, for one, <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>demonstrates</span></a> that in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide “subjects were less willing to send the same amount of aid to a refugee camp of 250,000 than they were to a refugee camp of 11,000.” This mechanism helps to explain how each additional Covid case or death does not equate to an attendant increase in risk or concern, and may even give way to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>complacency</span></a>.</p>
<div><p>Furthermore, humans are far more attuned to immediate and recognizable risk, such as an armed assailant or an acute natural disaster. It is far more difficult to comprehend the true magnitude of a complex web of <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>seemingly low-risk events</span></a>, be it from a virus with a low mortality rate or from the incremental unseen changes of climate change. Both have effects that are spread over time and hard to capture in any single, concise event. This obscures the connection between human behavior and any positive or negative ramifications. Furthermore, as the symptoms repeat with increasing frequency — be it the 312,672nd death or yet another warmest year on record&nbsp;— each additional iteration tends to make less of an impact. As Melissa Funicane, a social scientist at the Rand Corporation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>put it</span></a>: “the average human who’s not a statistical analyst or epidemiologist, doesn’t have the tools you need at their fingertips to make judgements about something as vast and complex as the global pandemic.”</p></div>
<h4><strong>Political Factors</strong></h4>
<p>Another clear potential reason comes from the spurious narrative that many of these deaths are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-94-percent-covid-among-caus/fact-check-94-of-individuals-with-additional-causes-of-death-still-had-covid-19-idUSKBN25U2IO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not actually due to Covid-19</span></a>. A popular conspiracy even goes so far as to suggest that medical authorities are attributing deaths from a range of causes to Covid-19 in an effort to make the crisis more dire, spread fear, and permit stronger government action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These narratives have been <a href="https://undark.org/2020/11/10/covid-19-death-counts-conspiracy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>repeatedly</span></a> and <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-baselessly-suggests-covid-19-deaths-inflated-for-profit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>soundly</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/30/trump-promotes-the-outlandish-claim-that-covid-19-has-killed-a-minuscule-number-of-americans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rejected</span></a>, and many suspect the true toll to be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/01/03/trump-claims-covid-deaths-are-exaggerated-as-us-surpasses-350000/?sh=10965bbc37b6" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>even higher</span></a> than the official figures. But whether or not people fully ascribe to the idea that deaths have been over-reported, it has played into doubt around the seriousness of the disease and whether official tallies and government warnings about its seriousness should be trusted. Arguments against the severity of Covid-19, such as that it is little different from the common flu, drive down concern about the virus, especially in more conservative populations. In December, Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/#republicans-and-democrats-differ-over-outbreaks-threat-to-public-health" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>found</span></a> that just 43% of Republicans see Covid-19 as a major threat to public health, compared to 84% of Democrats. Though there is fixation on Covid-19’s low mortality rate, now <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>just below 2%</span></a> in the U.S., there is a larger failure to recognize the scope of human suffering that mortality rate delivers across millions of cases, let alone from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22166236/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-symptoms-heart-fatigue" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>10% (or more) of patients</span></a> who exhibit <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-of-long-haul-covid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>long-term effects</span></a>. The severity of the disease, it seems, often fails to resonate until people are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/12/coronavirus-deaths-highest-us-rural-republican-leaning-county/3828902001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>personally, and often irreversibly</span></a>, affected, a dynamic that is <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not restricted</span></a> to the U.S. or the issue Covid-19.</p>
<div><p>In hyper-partisan conditions, it is no surprise that as the disease became politicized, certain populations may have begun to pay less attention. If one doesn’t believe that it is as deadly or widespread as is being reported, there’s little reason to monitor its progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>Demographic Factors</strong></h4>
<p>A final set of potential factors relates to specific populations that society consistently undervalues. These populations have <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-viz-covid-19-deaths-in-illinois-20210101-etvvpateifbzbbjkf33maqdqme-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffered the worst impacts</span></a> but are also those most commonly pushed out of sight, be it the elderly locked away in nursing homes or minority groups relegated to impoverished and underserved communities.</p>
<p>For example, Covid-19’s impacts are particularly acute on the elderly, who account for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-is-dying-from-covid-19-why-11601407258" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>roughly 8 in 10</span></a> of those who die. In a range of experiments, scientists have shown globally that people consistently <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>undervalue the elderly</span></a> vis-à-vis others, generally falling back on the explanation that those with fewer years left to live are less valuable than those with many more productive years ahead. Even if each of these individuals may be a deeply loved parent, sibling, friend, or mentor, this implicit devaluation plays into an interpretation that the disease is one that specifically impacts the elderly and is therefore less of a concern.</p>
<div><p>The virus has had a similarly outsized impact on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/14/946045921/how-do-we-grieve-300-000-lives-lost" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minority communities</span></a>. Data suggests, for example, that Black, Latino, and Indigenous Americans are several times more likely than white Americans to both be hospitalized and die from Covid-19. In LA, the site of the country’s worst outbreak, Latinos <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article247434155.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>account for</span></a> 59% of cases and 48.5% of deaths, even though they only account for 40% of the population. Individuals from these communities make up many of the essential workers who continue to work in <a href="https://theconversation.com/black-and-latino-essential-workers-experience-greater-safety-concerns-than-their-white-counterparts-141180" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>dangerous conditions</span></a> and typically have less of a safety net to fall back on. In a country that has consistently underserved minority communities, especially in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/23/914427907/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">matters of public health</a>, it’s no wonder that these communities <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffer disproportionately</span></a> and that the country as a whole — which is roughly 70% white — may be less attuned to the severity of the problem.</p></div>

<h4><strong>American Deaths Will Continue to Go Unseen</strong></h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>This project is a favorite of mine and so I wanted to share a glimpse of what we've been up to with <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's amazing GPT-3 language model</a>. Today I'll be sharing a couple of straightforward results with basic prompts only. There are more advanced avenues we're exploring for our use of GPT-3, such as fine-tuning (custom pre-training for specific datasets); you'll hear none of that today, but if you're interested in this topic, follow this blog for updates.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>I believe the future of monitoring has to include autonomous root cause tools. Deployment frequency and complexity make the "new" issue the driver of Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) today. You may always know when something breaks, but you won't always know what. Problem is, root cause often hides in log files... but since the volume of logs has grown enormous and it's not always clear what to search for when a new issue arises, we saw a need for a smarter tool to help with root cause.</p>

<h2>Our approach in a nutshell</h2>
<p>If you structure logs really well (we do this with machine learning), including free-text logs, even when there are only one or two examples for a given event type, you can start talking confidently about a "rare" event. Severity lets you talk about a "bad" event. So, you can imagine one log stream expressing a "rare" event, and then another log stream expressing an event that is both "rare" and "bad". A simple point process model lets us talk naively about how likely it is that such a pair of events should show up as close together in time or closer, given patterns of "rare" and "rare"+"bad" events in those two streams. Watching the data for a while will let you estimate parameters for this model, and you can start picking out bouts of such event pairs. Zebrium takes such a bout, and generates an incident report from it. The results we are seeing…</p>

<h2>The plain language challenge</h2>
<p>Our approach works really well at generating root cause reports: if there's a root cause indicator in the logs, it will almost always make its way into a concise root cause report. Our approach has proven robust to different kinds of applications and logs; it requires no training or rules, pre-built or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, there's a big challenge remaining here. The last mile of delivering the benefits of autonomous Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is translating even the concise reports we generate into something the user can understand. The user who needs the quick RCA is not always the person who can understand the oblique root cause indicators in a technical log file. Who is to consume these reports, and what composes them?</p>

<p>This challenge is even more stark for an Managed Service Provider (MSP) or enterprise. At a small company, engineers may be responsible for front-line triage. At a large company or MSP, there will be a front-line, typically junior person who needs a quick RCA; they can't be expected to know all the different intricacies of application logs and what those logs mean. To bring value over the last mile to them, we need plain-language.</p>

<h2>Enter GPT-3</h2>
<p>Now that I've set the stage, let me show you a couple of examples that I think make it clear how transformational GPT-3 can be in the context of our problem. I think you'll agree with me that autonomous RCA seems a lot more real when it's translated into plain-language, and surely a lot more accessible by a lot of users.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art bidirectional autoregressive transformer model, with parameters in the hundreds of billions. It is produced, trained, and maintained by OpenAI, and it has really brought start-of-the art, deep NLP to developers’ fingertips.</p>

<p>The most basic procedure for using GPT-3 looks like this -</p>

<p>1) Construct a “prompt” for the model – this is a sort of open-ended document that leaves the model to “continue the story”, as it were; the continuation or response is called a “completion”. For the below two-line examples, I used the following simple prompt construction:</p>

<p>An expert examined the logs for the incident.</p>
<p>The first log message was: &lt;first_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The last log message was: &lt;second_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The expert described what had happened, in plain English:</p>

<p>2) Select model (I used davinci) and parameters - for the below examples, I used the following parameters to the davinci GPT-3 model:</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>"max_tokens": 128,</p>
<p>"temperature": 1,</p>
<p>"top_p": 0.05,</p>
<p>"presence_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"frequency_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"best_of": 10</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>3) Call the API; post-process completion for dangling or repeated phrases, to-taste. Serve warm.</p>

<h2>Example one: Database shutdown</h2>
<p>We shut down the Postgres database backing our Atlassian stack. Thousands of events, largely errors, ensued in the logs. Zebrium dutifully generates a root cause report, based on an ML-driven auto-detection. The report looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png" alt="postgres incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png" alt="postgres incident summary" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>OK, so Zebrium did a pretty good job here. It autonomously picked these two log events out of thousands to display to the user on the list page. Often, the “FIRST” event reflects root cause and the “WORST” reflects follow-on problems; you’ll note here that the first is not even an error, but it’s rare, and happens too close to other incident events, according to our model, to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Now in this case, it’s pretty clear to someone who has looked at a log file before that the database was shut down by the administrator. You’ll also notice, though, above the log events, a field called “DESCRIPTION”: this was generated by GPT-3. It says:</p>

<p>“The database server was stopped by the administrator.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>We passed in the “FIRST” and “WORST” events, as described above, to GPT-3. Notice that the first line says that the “PostgreSQL RDBMS” was “Stopped”. The second line says that there was a “PSQLException” indicating that a connection was “terminating due to administrator command”.</p>

<p>The word “administrator” appears on a different line than the word “PostgreSQL”, and nowhere in the log messages are the words “database” or “server” to be found at all.</p>

<p>The algorithm is doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) Inferring that the statements on the two lines are related</p>
<p>2.) Inferring that they are both speaking about a “database server”</p>
<p>3.) Putting the two statements together: “stopped by the administrator”</p>

<p>Essentially, this is the sort of summary someone would put into a ticketing system; here, it’s being done automatically, thanks to an appropriately selected pair of log messages coupled with a language model.</p>

<h2><span>Example two: Out of memory</span><span></span></h2>
<p>In this case, and using the same parameters as were used in the previous example, we take a root cause report for what turns out to be an out-of-memory issue to GPT-3 and see what sort of summary it gives us.</p>

<p>This particular report was generated in response to a signal from a monitoring tool that saw endpoint latencies spike too high. The system was configured with Zebrium to provide root cause observability across the stack. Here is the report Zebrium ML generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png" alt="oom_incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=520&amp;name=oom_incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=oom_incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png" alt="oom_incident_summary" width="908" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=454&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 454w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 908w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1362&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1362w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1816&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1816w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2270&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2270w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2724&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2724w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></p>

<p>In this case, it’s not so clear that the problem is due to an out-of-memory issue, unless the reader is familiar with Linux and the OOM killer facility. There are a lot of technical parameters in these events as well, obscuring what was really at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a look above the log messages again, in the “DESCRIPTION” field, let’s see what GPT-3 gave us:</p>

<p>“The memcached process was killed by the OOM killer</p>
<p>because it was consuming too much memory. The OOM killer</p>
<p>is a Linux kernel feature that allows the system to kill</p>
<p>a process when <strong><u>the system is running out of memory</u></strong>.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>What this summary tells us explicitly in plain-language is that the system was running out of memory. This is in fact the root cause of the original incident, tallying up a successful root cause summary.</p>

<p>For an L1 or L2, the Zebrium root cause summary may not be enough. That person won’t necessarily know that OOM means out-of-memory, or that the “FIRST” message isn’t talking about an application issue entirely within memcached.</p>

<h2>What more I wanted here</h2>
<p>In the second example, I would have liked to have seen some recognition that the first line implies that the system was out-of-memory, and therefore the second line was due to related problems (in fact, the application server was paged out). It’s a lot to ask, but I think it might be possible, given some combination of more expressive prompts, finetuning, and presenting GPT-3 with other select data from the report (in this case, the report also included metrics anomalies showing a plunge in swap free).</p>

<h2><span>A cool direction</span></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that GPT-3 gave us a lot of extra detail about the Linux OOM killer than was mentioned in the log messages themselves. I believe it was able to provide this context in the same way it knew that PSQL referred to a database server: it was trained on the internet. There is likely enough information in the public domain that, as GPT-3 was being trained, it picked up enough cursory knowledge of these sorts of systems to add additional value.</p>

<p>To test my hypothesis, I spent some time fiddling quite unscientifically with the prompt and model parameters, trying to get it to expound on the OOM example as describe above. I also gave the model a much larger budget of response tokens. Eventually, I teased out this response:</p>

<p>The root cause of the …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>ExaGear is a dynamic binary translation layer to run x86_32 and x86_64 applications on Arm 64-bit Linux systems.</p>



<p>You can download it <a href="https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/archive/ExaGear/ExaGear_V100R002C00.tar.gz">here</a>. On an RPM-based distribution, just unpack the archive and install.</p>



<p>A CentOS 7 rootfs is shipped, you might want to install vte-profile afterwards.</p>



<h4>Hardware requirements</h4>



<p>A 64-bit Arm CPU with floating point and SIMD extensions. If it can run a conventional Linux distribution, it’ll be able to run this.</p>



<h4>Kernel requirements</h4>



<p>You’ll have to install the p64k variant for systems with a 64KB page size set up (which ships with the x86_64 -&gt; arm64 translator only, not the x86_32 to arm64 one). Some applications might not work on such a system.</p>



<p>You’ll also need a kernel with 48-bit VA space, 39-bit of VA space kernel configurations are not compatible with ExaGear.</p>



<h4>Memory model</h4>



<p>ExaGear does not follow TSO completely by default, using heuristics instead. This can be configured through /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf.</p>



<p>SMO_MODE=fbase is the default, with SMO_SEVERITY=smart. For full compliance, you can run those commands:</p>



<pre><code>sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_32.conf
sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf</code></pre>



<p>On Tegra K1 64-bit and Tegra Xavier, you’ll want to set SMO_MODE=none, as their CPU implements sequential consistency as the memory model. This setting provides a free performance boost with no downsides on that hardware.</p>



<h4>Performance</h4>



<p>For running your Docker containers or whatever on an Apple Silicon Mac too, this is a much faster solution than qemu-user.</p>



<p>Some performance numbers on Tegra Xavier: <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183</a>. (Geekbench arm64 Android compared to x86_64 Linux Geekbench results on the same hardware)</p>



<p>Because ExaGear doesn’t implement the AES instructions, the scores for those is an outlier. Apart from that case, the results are pretty good.</p>

<p>
From the Snowden revelations we learned not only about NSA data collection projects, but also about many software tools that are used to analyze and search those data. These programs run on secure computer networks, isolated from the public internet. Here we will provide an overview of these networks that are used by the US military and US intelligence agencies.</p><p>

Besides computer networks, they also use a number of dedicated telephone networks, but gradually these are transferred from traditional circuit-switched networks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP" target="_blank">Voice over IP</a> (VoIP). This makes it possible to have only one IP packet-switched network for both computer and phone services. It seems that for example NSA's <a href="http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/02/nsa-director-alexanders-phones.html#nsts">NSTS</a> phone system is now fully IP-based.</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" width="450"></a><br>

The main US military and intelligence computer networks are (of course) only accessible for authorized personnel from the United States. Special security measures are in place to prevent interception by foreign intelligence agencies. Most of the tools and programs used by NSA run on JWICS and NSANet, but here we only mention them when this is confirmed by  documents. </p><blockquote>

These various military and intelligence networks run on a world-wide physical infrastructure that is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Information_Systems_Network" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Network</a> (DISN), which is maintained by the <a href="http://www.disa.mil/" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Agency</a> (DISA) and consists of landline, mobile, radio and satellite communication links.</p><p>

Most of these communication links are not connected to the public internet, but because radio and satellite transmissions can easily be intercepted by foreign countries, the security of these networks is assured by encryption. This encryption can also be used to run higher classified traffic over communication links with a lower classification level through Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels.</p><p>

Classified communications have to be protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite A Cryptography</a>, which contains very strong and classified encryption algorithms. On most networks this is implemented by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_product" target="_blank">Type 1</a> certified <a href="http://www.gdc4s.com/products/secure-voice-and-data-products-catergory-listing/network-encryption.html?taxonomyCat=326" target="_blank">TACLANE</a> (KG-175A/D) in-line network encryptors made by General Dynamics:</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" width="400"></a><br>

<p>

As long there's the appropriate strong link encryption, only the end points with the computer terminals (where data are processed before they are encrypted) need strict physical and digital security requirements in order to prevent any kind of eavesdropping or interception by foreign adversaries.</p><p>

Most American military bases are connected to the SIPRNET backbone, but for tactical users in the field, the SIPRNet and JWICS networks can extend to mobile sites through Satellite Communications (SATCOM) links, like for example <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/TROJAN_SPIRIT" target="_blank">TROJAN SPIRIT</a> and TROJAN SPIRIT LITE, which consist of a satellite terminal that can be on a pallet, in a shelter, on a trailer or even connected to a transit case.</p><p>

Besides the aforementioned networks that are only accessible for authorized military and intelligence personnel from the United States, there are also computer networks set up by the US for multinational coalitions, and which therefore can also be used by officials from partner countries. </p><p>

The group of countries that have access to such coalition networks is often denoted by a number of "Eyes" corresponding with the number of countries that participate.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>One of the worst parts of modern life is how <em>unsatisfying</em> it is to hang up on somebody. Tapping on the ‘End Call’ button on an iPhone or angrily clicking ‘Leave Meeting’ on Zoom just isn’t nearly as fun as slamming down the handset on a <em>real phone</em>.</p>
<p>This particular project was to breathe some life into the antique Northern Telecom phone from my grandparents’ house by attaching it to a modern VoIP system. This was surprisingly difficult, but very satisfying as the result is essentially a free ‘vintage’ landline for my home.</p>
<p><img src="https://nbailey.ca/images/nt500.jpg" alt="Northern Telecom model 500"></p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-phone">The Phone</h3>
<p>The device in question is a NT analog phone, based on the classic Western Electric model 500. The models are very similar with only minor differences, for example the printing of the numbers on the dial is slightly different for models from Canada. Based on the stamp marks on the bottom, I believe this phone was manufactured in 1969 and installed shortly after, which does match up with when my grandparents would have purchased their first phone.</p>
<p>On its own, this telephone would not work with any modern telecom system. The ‘pulse dial’ that it produces is not compatible with modern telephone equipment and VoIP adapters alike.</p>
<p>I can’t get a good source on this, but most telephone exchanges in urban areas haven’t accepted pulse dial signals for decades. Some areas may still accept pulse signalling depending on the age of their equipment, but in 2021 I doubt there are many left. Seeing as how Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling">DTMF</a>) signalling has been the standard for over forty years, <em>nearly all</em> VoIP equipment was manufactured without support for old devices.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-dialling">Pulse Dialling</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/images/pulse-dialing.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Pulse dialing is very simple as it is derived from the mechanical rotation of the dial. As it turns from the dialed digit back to the resting position it toggles the local loop voltage to transmit the data to the FXO. In the old days, these voltage ‘ticks’ were used to rotate mechanical switches in the exchange stations to connect physical circuits needed to complete a call.</p>
<h3 id="dtmf-dialling">DTMF Dialling</h3>
<p>DTMF on the other hand is an in-band signalling method using eight different frequencies transmitted in pairs. To use the example from Wikipedia, to transmit a ‘1’ on a DTMF system it will transmit two tones, 1209Hz and 695Hz together:</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/MultiTone1.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling#/media/File:MultiTone1.png">Photo Source: Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tones are the beeps we’re used to hearing when dialing. Even my cell phone creates these tones when you type on the on-screen keypad in the ‘Phone’ app, though it’s mostly for ‘cosmetic’ reasons. Theoretically one could use these tones to dial on a rotary phone if you held the speaker of the cell phone up to the microphone of the telephone while dialling, though I couldn’t get it to reliably work.</p>
<h3 id="converting-signalling">Converting signalling</h3>
<p>So, the first piece of equipment I needed was a pulse-tone converter. Indeed, such a device does exist to convert the ‘ticks’ produced by the rotary dial to the ‘beeps’ produced by most keypad phones. I was a little squeamish about tearing apart a working antique, so I opted to buy an external dial tone converter box from <a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converters/">OldPhoneWorks</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/images/D/small%202-212.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converter.html">Photo Source: OldPhoneWorks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a very simple device which listens for the pulse tones and using tiny DSP chips converts them to DTMF tones. If your only goal was to use the old phone with a POTS landline this would be sufficient, but I want to connect this to VoIP.</p>
<h3 id="the-sip-ata-box">The SIP ATA box</h3>
<p>There are <em>heaps</em> of Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) boxes on the market, but in the interest of keeping this project low-cost I opted to purchase a new-old-stock <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/csbpvga/pap2t/administration/guide/pap2t_user.pdf">Linksys PAP2T-NA</a> device from eBay. I wasn’t too worried about security since the device sits in the ‘enclave’ part of my home network isolated from personal devices, and won’t have any ports forwarded to it. I was initially worried that my custom <a href="https://nbailey.ca/post/linux-firewall-ids">Linux router</a> would cause issues with the UDP traffic RTP creates, but it handled it wonderfully.</p>
<p>Setup was fairly straightforward to begin with, entering my sub-account credentials and SIP proxy server. Without too much fuss the device was registered and communicating with my provider.</p>
<p>However, I did run into some strange issues after initially setting it up. First, the ring pattern was intermittent and sounded <em>strange</em>. After a couple test calls I also found that both sides of the conversation were quiet when using the vintage phone. With some fiddling, I rectified these by increasing power limits slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed ring waveform to Sinusoid</li>
<li>Changed ring voltage to 90</li>
<li>Changed FXS port power limit -3 -&gt; 5</li>
<li>Changed FXS port input &amp; output gain -3 -&gt; 0</li>
</ul>
<p>I chalk these up to the mechanical nature of the ringer and the age of the mic/speaker. After all, there’s a lot more energy involved in moving a hammer around than powering a little beeper.</p>
<h3 id="making-calls">Making calls</h3>
<p>That night, I successfully ordered a pizza using an antique phone. Dialing was laborious, but novel for somebody my age, and honestly kind of fun.</p>
<p>Monthly costs are minimal, only $0.80 for the DID number and an additional $0.005 per minute. Calls are clear and sound great, and after nearly a month of use I can say that it’s reliable and solid as a ‘landline’ replacement. Plus, it makes a great conversation piece!</p>
<p>There are certainly improvements I would could make, for example adding SRTP to add another layer of security for my calls. It would also be nice to add additional handsets to my house to build an ‘intercom’ - that is if I can find more old phones.</p>

When I first discovered it in 2016, I really liked how it can almost be fully customized as per the likes. Well, almost, because there was no way you could add or configure any buttons on the top side of the editor. FYI, this is possible in many popular IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, and even Notepad++. I was more of a mouse-guy back then so the lack of GUI buttons was hindering my so called <em>developer productivity</em>.</p><p>I decided to build an extension for this. That would add handy buttons for many common commands like save file, format (beautify) file, show opened files list, etc. To build this, I followed VSCode extension development docs and learned typescript along the way. I named it <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jerrygoyal.shortcut-menu-bar">Shortcut Menu Bar</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/1.png" alt="Shortcut Menu Bar"><figcaption>Shortcut Menu Bar</figcaption></figure><p>Fast-forward to 2020, and it got over 10k+ downloads and multiple 5-star ratings. I guess I wasn't the only mouse-guy out there.<br>
<!-- -->Out of Covid boredom, I decided to put a donate button to see what happens. I explored few platforms to create donation links like buymeacoffee.com (charges 5% fee), patreon.com (more geared towards recurring donations, 5% fee), PayPal (UI sucks), Ko-Fi.com (0% fee and nice clean UI).</p><p>I made a free account on ko-fi.com, linked my PayPal account, and created a donation link. I added that link to the extension description.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/2.png" alt="Buy me a coffee"><figcaption>Buy me a coffee</figcaption></figure><p>And guess what? someone donated 5$.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/3.png" alt="donation via ko-fi.com"><figcaption>donation via ko-fi.com</figcaption></figure><p>I know I know, it's not that big amount, but somebody put an effort to make that transaction means he cared about it and found it useful.
I hope it inspires people who want to contribute and build stuff in the FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) community. It's so captivating that the whole tech industry relies (and thrives) on open source software made by people in their free time.<br>

    <meta itemprop="description" content="A fast concurrent persistent key-value store and log, in C# and C++. Latest release v1.7.4">
    
    

    <section itemprop="text">
      <p>Managing large application state easily, resiliently, and with high performance is one of the hardest
problems in the cloud today. The FASTER project offers two artifacts to help tackle this problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER Log</strong> is a high-performance concurrent persistent recoverable log, iterator, and random 
reader library in C#. It supports very frequent commit operations at low latency, and can quickly saturate 
disk bandwidth. It supports both sync and async interfaces, handles disk errors, and supports checksums. Learn 
more about using the FASTER Log in C# <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER KV</strong> is a concurrent key-value store + cache (available in C# and C++) that is designed for point 
lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external 
storage (local or cloud). It also supports consistent recovery using a new checkpointing technique that lets 
applications trade-off performance for commit latency. Learn more about the FASTER KV in C# 
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">here</a>. For the FASTER C++ port, check <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-cpp/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ol>
  <li>Latch-free cache-optimized index, in FASTER KV.</li>
  <li>A fast persistent recoverable append-only log based on fine-grained epoch protection for concurrency, 
in FASTER Log.</li>
  <li>Unique “hybrid record log” design in FASTER KV, that combines the above log with in-place updates, to 
shape the memory working set and retain performance.</li>
  <li>Architecture as a component that can be embedded in multi-threaded cloud apps.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous non-blocking recovery model based on group commit.</li>
  <li>A rich extensible storage device abstraction called <code>IDevice</code>, with implementations for local
storage, cloud storage, tiered storage, and sharded storage.</li>
</ol>

<p>For standard benchmarks where the working set fits in main memory, we found FASTER KV to achieve
significantly higher throughput than current systems, and match or exceed the performance of pure 
in-memory data structures while offering more functionality. See our <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/td-research-papers/">research papers</a>
for more details. We also have a detailed analysis of C# FASTER KV performance in a wiki page 
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/wiki/Performance-of-FASTER-in-C%23">here</a>. The performance of the 
C# and C++ versions of FASTER is very similar. FASTER Log is also extremely fast, capable of saturating modern
NVMe SSDs using less than a core of CPU, and scaling well in a multi-threaded setting.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We now support variable-length keys and values in FasterKV C# via <code>Memory&lt;byte&gt;</code> and more generally <code>Memory&lt;T&gt; where T : unmanaged</code> as key/value/input types. We also added
a new type called <code>SpanByte</code> to represent variable-length keys and values. See the sample <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples/StoreVarLenTypes">here</a> for details on these capabilities. This is in addition to the existing object-log support for class types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support C# async in FASTER KV (and FASTER Log). See the guides for <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">FasterKV</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">FasterLog</a> 
for more information. Also, check out the samples <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples">here</a>.</p>
