</p>


<h2><span id="Bill_Gates_is_my_hero">Bill Gates is my hero</span></h2>
<p>Bill Gates was an early guiding light and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">our</a> inspiration. When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Krzysztof_Biedalak" title="Krzysztof Biedalak">Krzysztof Biedalak</a> and I made our first $3 investment in a corporate rubber stamp, which was a post-communist obligation for all companies in Poland in 1991, Microsoft was a multibillion-dollar company. How could we not have been blinded by inspiration? We wanted to write a universally useful piece of software and the world would be ours - we thought. Bill Gates's software philosophy, based on respect for backward compatibility, sheltered <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> on its path to its painfully slow adoption. Software and database compatibility have been preserved for 30 years now. My first pieces of knowledge in medical sciences, typed in on Dec 13, 1987, are still there in my collection, well-memorized and useful. Without Gates and his stance on compatibility, I would have lost all that knowledge to some upgrade hiccup long ago. When Gates moved to philanthropy, he has secured his place on my list of the greatest people who ever walked this planet. Perhaps as many as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_saved_over_100_million_children" title="Bill Gates saved over 100 million children">30-120 million kids have been saved by Bill's foundation</a>. This begs a vital question: Why is Gates so awfully wrong about education? Why does he fall for the same old myth that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Myth:_You_can_improve_education_by_throwing_more_money_in_it" title="Myth: You can improve education by throwing more money in it">investing in education will produce better outcomes</a>? The education system is wrong and it must be redesigned. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end" title="Compulsory schooling must end">Compulsory schooling must end</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Grand_Education_Reform" title="Grand Education Reform">Grand Education Reform</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Could_Bill.27s_great_mind_be_wrong.3F">Could Bill's great mind be wrong?</span></h2>
<p>Everyone who disagrees with a great mind needs to pause and re-examine. Gates got sensational credentials. He sports a genius mind. He has seen more places that I could possibly ever manage to visit in Google Maps. He has spoken to more great people than I have had a chance to read about. He has visited more schools that I have seen on pictures. He started his forays into education in 1999. In contrast, I started thinking about "the system" only in 2016 when getting ready to write this <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">book</a>. This makes me into a fledgling with an immature point of view. Gates himself is a great example of a brisk student who has turned his skills and talents into a monumental achievement. His credentials are so much better than mine!
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_perspective">Bill Gates's perspective</span></h2>
<p>Could this just be that Gates's perspective is so much different than mine?
</p><p>He looks at the education system like at the operating system. Measure the performance, look for bottlenecks in the system, fix the parameter here and there, videotape a great teacher, and make others copy the method, and manufacture greatness.
</p><p>He looks at education like a philanthropic job. Like he treats health problems with mass vaccinations, he looks for a simple formula which could improve the education of the masses with some industrial move? He seems less focused on letting the brightest thrive, and more focused on preventing the weakest from dropping out. He wants to bring up the average using some <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">standardized testing</a> approach.
</p><p>He looks at education like a big company that needs to be managed effectively with departments, and sub-departments. With a clear division of responsibility. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy#Schooling_is_like_Soviet_Economy" title="Modern schooling is like Soviet economy">With an industrial goal in mind?</a>
</p><p>Could this be that this great capitalist shows more socialist thinking than a little well-indoctrinated ex-communist like myself?
</p><p>There is a different perspective of an employer and an employee, esp. in a creative position. Gates looks at the number of college graduates. I look for specific skills and creative powers. Actual degrees do not matter much if you take time to get into a particular brain.
</p><p>He looks at students like productive workers. The heretic idea of a longer school day must have come from the factory model thinking. Longer days, more production, more manufacturing.
</p><p>He looks at education from a societal point of view, while I look at the brain of an individual. He wants to move the masses to high achievement, while I want to produce more little Bill Gateses.
</p><p>Unlike myself, Bill Gates does not focus on having more Bill Gateses. He focuses on helping the poor, in boosting qualifications of the middle class, and adds "<i>you can't run a society on top 5%</i>". He is right, however, that top 5% can forge a path in education that would inspire all the rest. They cannot be run through a compulsory system set on pushing through the remaining 95%.
</p><p>Gates's approach would be great for some poorer countries (e.g. in Africa). Where there are no schools, industrial approach and good management could quickly improve health, eliminate poverty, and provide basic education.
</p><p>My approach is probably more suited to well-developed nations where the industrial approach makes people sick of schooling. With social awareness and education on the rise, we look for more little future Noble Prize winners and future Bill Gateses.
</p><p>His own kids get the best kind of learning. During his trips around the world, they get to visit places like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This could spark a life-long passion that could turn them into future particle physicists or another incarnation of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.  
</p><p>Where Gates optimizes for improving the average, I am looking for the optimum of peak intellectual performance.
</p><p>Last but not least, could Gates's approach be an afterglow of his dropping out from Harvard. I see that over and over again, dropouts seem to suffer from this life-long hangover about what could have been? They tend to over-appreciate the power of schooling or the power of college. In the same way, I might be under-appreciating my own degrees. Gates is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Thiel_on_competition_for_degrees" title="Thiel on competition for degrees">the opposite of Peter Thiel</a> who studiously climbed the educational ladder until he stumbled to see the light. Thiel is now one of the staunchest critics of college.
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_formula_for_success">Bill Gates's formula for success</span></h2>
<p>I see Gates's own life as a simple formula for success in science, engineering, or life in general:
</p>
<ul><li> healthy childhood of few concerns (preferably without the relegation to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>)</li>
<li> healthy approach to schooling with pranks, rebellions, disobedience, and freedom </li>
<li> minor trajectory nudges within the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone" title="Push zone">push zone</a> by inspirational tutors. If tutors are not parents, this might be the most expensive part of the formula</li>
<li> breakthrough passion, e.g. for tinkering with computers or software</li>
<li> healthy education, possibly interrupted by some breakthrough decision (e.g. <i>Let me drop out from Harvard to set up the greatest software company in the world</i>)</li>
<li> relentless lifelong pursuit of goals born from that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">youthful passion</a></li>
<li> voracious reading (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_and_his_non-incremental_reading" title="Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading">Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading</a>)</li></ul>
<p>Only Bill Gates truly knows it, but my understanding of his life story is that his future was determined by just one major factor: getting his hands on a computer. He was good at math and programming. So are dozens of kids in my neighborhood. My thinking comes from the fact that I was also strongly affected by my first contact with computers.
</p>

<p>When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/First_steps_of_SuperMemo" title="First steps of SuperMemo">I got my first computer in 1986</a>, ZX Spectrum, I was 24 and experienced wild elation with computer's obedience in executing my commands. I told the computer what to do, and it did it perfectly without asking questions. That was wonderful. I started writing my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">program for planning my day</a> on paper long before I got the computer on my desk. I was eager to see it work! As ZX Spectrum would load programs from a cassette tape, I could not easily dream of having <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. It needed access to some disk drive. I got my first PC with a 360 KB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">floppy disk</a> drive only <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_1.0_for_DOS_(1987)" title="SuperMemo 1.0 for DOS (1987)">in 1987</a></p>
<p>The above hypothetical formula for educational success is simple and effective. Only a few might ever dream to replicate the scope of Bill's success. If that formula does not bring serial Nobel Prize winners, it should at least bring up a great deal of happy and fulfilled individuals. Freedom to explore the world is essential and it is denied to a great deal of kids in the modern world. When Peter Thiel pays kids to drop out from college, he looks for this type of free thinking experience that can change one life and then can change the world.
</p>
<h2><span id="My_attempt_at_employing_Gates.27s_formula">My attempt at employing Gates's formula</span></h2>

<p>I am happy with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_adoption_of_spaced_repetition" title="Exponential adoption of spaced repetition">my achievements in life</a>. I have followed the formula employed by Gates. However, there were some exceptions. Perhaps I could use them as an excuse for not being as wildly successful as Bill? I was sent to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>, and I am sure this slowed down my development. The time I spent with my brother was more intellectual and inspirational by two orders of magnitude. However, he was a student and could not babysit the little me for ever. In later years, I was forced into a degree of conformity by an ever-present threat of being enlisted by the army in service of the Warsaw Pact. In 1986, I was finally free of the army service, and could finally drop out, however, I was not ready. There was no market economics culture in Poland of the 1980s. I read about entrepreneurial science in Science in 1989 (Oct 31, 1989). This was the first time when it occurred to me that my research into memory might actually be a seed of a business. Initially, though, my passions led me in the direction of a PhD. Schooling told me that science done by entrepreneurs is inferior to science done in academia. I thought of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> as an opportunity to earn money for a trip to America. It seems that while Gates was fast to mature as a little entrepreneur, I needed 28 long years to even start thinking of my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">own business</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Reconciling_Gates_and_Woz">Reconciling Gates and Woz</span></h2>
<p>Gates wants better teachers, better education, verification, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">testing</a>, measuring, carrot-and-stick for teachers, etc. In contrast, I stand with Steve Jobs. Jobs told the kids to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning" title="Fundamental law of learning">rebel</a>!
</p><p>Gates believes that the key to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform" title="Reform">great future education system</a> is the teacher. He is almost right. If we could populate present schools with great teachers, I wouldn't ever need to write <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">this book</a>. The problem is that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Progressive_education" title="Progressive education">a great teacher is simply a truly great man</a>. Great teaching requires a degree of genius. We need millions of those great people. How can we possibly hope to produce hundreds of thousands …</p></div></div>

November 27, 2020 | https://htmx.org/posts/2020-11-24-htmx-1.0.0-is-released/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://htmx.org/posts/2020-11-24-htmx-1.0.0-is-released/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h2>htmx 1.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>I'm happy to announce the <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/htmx.org@1.0.0/">1.0.0 release</a> of htmx.</p>
<p>htmx is now mature enough that I can recommend it as a general replacement for intercooler.js
projects.  I <strong>don't</strong> think there is a strong reason to port an existing intercooler project to
htmx.  I have several large intercooler apps and will not be moving them over any time soon. I can, however, recommend using htmx over intercooler for new projects.</p>
<p>htmx is a different sort of javascript library.  It is an HTML &amp; hypertext-oriented reply to the current dominance of javascript-based SPA libraries.  It is a response to Tom MacWright's question:
<a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">"If not SPAs, What?"</a>.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://htmx.org/">homepage says</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> be able to make HTTP requests?</li>
<li>Why should only <code>click</code> &amp; <code>submit</code> events trigger them?</li>
<li>Why should only GET &amp; POST be available?</li>
<li>Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML-oriented web development was abandoned not because hypertext was a bad idea, but rather because HTML didn't have sufficient expressive power.  htmx aims to fix that &amp; allows you to implement <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/">many common modern web UI patterns</a> using the original hypertext model of the web.</p>
<h3>History &amp; Thanks</h3>
<p>htmx began life as <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a> back in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/intercooler-js/commit/62d3dbdb5c056ee866aba3575e148de649fc3efe">2013</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/commit/e38dea64dd1065003a0e833d7b469d24e6bc2919">april</a> of this year I began work on a jQuery-indepenent &amp; improved version of intercoolerjs, renamed
to htmx.  I chose to rename the library because, in working on intercooler, I had come to appreciate that intercooler &amp; htmx were completing HTML as a hypertext rather than just some funky, idiosyncratic javascript libraries.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/releases/tag/v0.0.1">May</a> htmx reached 0.0.1.  Soon thereafter I had the good fortune of being contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_pylo">Ben Croker</a>
who was interested in htmx as a base for his new reactive library, <a href="https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/sprig">Sprig</a>.  Ben was willing to be an early adopter of htmx and pushed the library along
much faster than it would have gone otherwise.</p>
<p>I have been very lucky to the have help and feedback from many contributors in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/graphs/contributors">Github</a> and on <a href="https://htmx.org/discord">Discord</a>.  I'd like to thank, in particular, <a href="https://github.com/benpate">Ben Pate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rschroll">Robert Schroll</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/jreviews">Alejandro Schmeichler</a> for contributing code as well as new ideas and discussions.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="https://devmode.fm/">Devmode.fm</a> for having me on to <a href="https://devmode.fm/episodes/dynamic-html-with-htmx">talk about htmx</a> and for cleaning up all my "uhhs" and "umms".</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/jsampson">Justin Sampson</a>, who took a lot of time to explain REST &amp; HATEOAS to me and how intercooler (and now htmx) fit into that model for web development.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I bumped the version number :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h2 id="i">I</h2><p>I, like many other people, have discovered that it is almost impossible to think seriously without writing. Writing clarifies and sharpens your thoughts in a way that is superior to merely articulating them in a conversation. It allows you to look at your ideas more objectively, almost as if they were from another person. You can then examine them and think about if what you have written down is really true.</p><p>However, more often than discovering that your ideas are wrong, you will discover something different: that you do not know what you think. Sure, you have some vague idea, and you believe that there is a chain of reasoning that leads to a certain conclusion. But what you will discover is that this chain of reasoning is mostly not existent. At best, it has many holes and maybe leads not where you think it does. This discovery is, of course, very unpleasant and sometimes even painful. In a sense, you have lied to yourself by thinking you have thought through this specific topic when, in reality, you have only copied the opinion of someone else.</p><p>This process requires an immense amount of honesty because nobody likes to feel stupid. Either you do not know what you think, in which case you feel stupid. Or it turns out that what you believed to be your opinion does not really make sense, is logically inconsistent, and mostly copied from someone else, in which case you feel stupid as well. However, the reward for all this exhausting work is clarity and simplicity. You now possess a chain of reasoning where you have looked as carefully as you can for holes and problems. The next step is to let others examine your reasoning—publishing.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I am happy when others enjoy my work and when I can offer a new perspective, but for me, the criticism of my ideas is the most rewarding part of publishing. This is why I recently wrote:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't write to criticize others; write to be criticized by others.</p>— Sven Schnieders (@SvenSchnieders) <a href="https://twitter.com/SvenSchnieders/status/1303074445003812864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>If you care about being less wrong tomorrow than you are today, you have to take this extreme attitude towards criticism. It will show in your writings and in the way you express your ideas. If you want to be perceived as smart and right, you will articulate your ideas in a moderate way so that others agree with it. (This is one of the main problems I have with contemporary intellectuals who always seem to take the middle ground.) If you are searching for truth, you will articulate the most extreme and radical consequences of your ideas, precisely because others will disagree with them and tell you where your ideas are wrong.</p><p>A good example is a discussion about the distribution of intelligence (not IQ) that I often have with my dad. To crudely summarize the discussion: he believes most people are too stupid to understand complex ideas; for him, this even applies to people who do not recognize the importance of free speech (the real free speech without the “but”). On the other hand, I think that the difference between people’s minds is mostly quantitative (speed and memory) and that almost everyone can understand complex ideas if they take the time and put in the effort; for me, this even applies to, e.g., quantum mechanics.</p><p>I do not want to get into the discussion (that’s a different essay, and it is more nuanced than I portrayed it here), but note how radically different our positions are. It is because we both put forward the most extreme consequence of our theories. If he or I cared about finding a consensus and about looking correct, we could have used different examples: he could have said that people cannot understand complex systems like capitalism, and I could have said that people are capable of understanding even classical physics.</p><p>Notice that the disagreement looks way less severe using these examples. Some people might even argue that understanding how capitalism works is more difficult than understanding classical physics. It feels as if we are way closer to a compromise or to finding a common ground. But in reality, were are just further away from finding the truth because our disagreement is not as clear and obvious as it could be, which leads to worse criticism.</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>This way of expressing ideas can sometimes be perceived as rude because, in contrast to most other people, you are not searching for consensus but for the truth. However, it is not a form of arrogance to express the most extreme consequences of your ideas; it is a form of intellectual honesty. In this way, your ideas are widely open to criticism, and you are therefore more likely to learn something. You are also more likely to look stupid, but that is a price you must be willing to pay.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>The inherent fuzziness of conversations makes it difficult to notice gaps in your understanding and reasoning. This applies both to your conversation partner and to yourself.</p><p>Having a conversation with someone else about your ideas is only superior to writing about them under two conditions. First, if you have already thought about your ideas on the topic a lot and have carefully examined your chain of reasoning, which, as I have already explained, is best done in writing. And second, if the other person is smart, has thought about the topic a lot as well, and values truth over consensus. If, and only if, both of these conditions are met, a conversation can be more fruitful in sharpening your ideas than writing about them. There are other advantages to conversations with regards to creativity, thought-provoking impulses, and inspiration, but for thinking deeply about a topic, writing is superior to a conversation.</p><h2 id="v">V</h2><p>Anyone who reads books that are commonly known as <em>the classics</em> will be somewhat discouraged from publishing their writing because these people were so smart. Every idea you come up with has probably been expressed better by someone else (most likely even by Plato because, as some say, <a href="https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/philosophy/footnotes_plato.html">all of western philosophy is merely a series of footnotes to his works</a>). Put differently by Allen Farrington:</p><blockquote>“The classics are classic because those people were a lot smarter than us and we kinda wish they were still around telling the rest of us idiots what to do.”</blockquote><p>Although I whole hardheartedly agree with this sentiment and might one day decide to write up my thoughts on why I think we are “stupider” than our ancestors, it does not have to be demotivating. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Recognizing that our contemporary intellectuals are, let’s just say, “not up for the task” should be a motivation for everyone else. I think the question,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have the smart people always been this stupid?</p>— Heather E Heying (@HeatherEHeying) <a href="https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1327124783365021696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>should be answered with a resounding no. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, being mostly unworthy of the great works of the past. But it does not mean that we cannot make ourselves worthy. You (and I) may not possess the courage of Nietzsche or the wisdom of Plato, but it is our responsibility to breathe new life into their thoughts—to think them further—and since they are not around, there is no point in being discouraged.</p><h2 id="vi">VI</h2><p>Do not compare yourself to the classics; they are dead and cannot solve our problems for us. If you need confidence, compare yourself to contemporary intellectuals, and you will see that society needs all the help it can get. Remember, “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_land_of_the_blind,_the_one-eyed_man_is_king">in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,</a>” and one thing is certain: there are very few two-eyed men left.</p><p>Every time I get disappointed in my ability to think and articulate my thoughts, which happens frequently, I look at contemporary intellectuals and remember Bukowski’s words:</p><blockquote>“I had to continue because they were so bad, not because I was so good; and I’m still not so good, but they’re still very bad.”</blockquote><h2 id="vii">VII</h2><p>This essay is my way of saying: Start writing! You will learn as much about the topic as about yourself. You will be shocked by how often you trick yourself into falsely thinking that you have understood something. You will write and think, “Oh, is this why I think that? I didn’t know that.” </p><p>The process is exciting, challenging, scary, and sometimes painful, but above all, it is worth it. And one day, you and I might be able to read the great works of the past and feel that we have honored their achievements by keeping their ideas alive, and maybe we have even managed to think some of them further.</p><p>Thank you for reading my essay.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-type="text"><p>If someone had told me a decade ago that I was going to produce the first (and, so far, only) published reconstruction of Chopin's posthumous Mazurka in F Minor that includes every uncanceled measure of the composer's sketch, I would have laughed. But apparently when a performance opportunity inspires a research obsession, unexpected things can happen.</p><p>I'm no piano virtuoso, but for some years I've performed chamber music and solo programs on a church recital series. As a student I learned Fauré's B-Minor Nocturne; Scriabin's Preludes, Op. 74; and Scott Joplin's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Magnetic Rag</em>—each of which is its respective composer's last completed composition for solo piano (and in the case of the latter two, the composer's last completed composition). Eventually I had the idea of performing an entire recital of such works, adding Schubert's Sonata in B-flat, D. 960; Schumann's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Ghost Variations</em>; Brahms's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Klavierstücke</em>, Op. 119; and the piece that is generally considered Chopin's last: the Mazurka in F Minor, Op. 68, No. 4.<br></p><p>Of these last completed piano works, the mazurka was the least finished. Chopin customarily composed at the piano, then notated a sketch, and lastly wrote a fair copy. But for the work published posthumously as Op. 68, No. 4, he only got as far as the sketch, a confusing one-page document that was discovered after his death in 1849.<br></p><p>Virtually all editions of the complete Chopin mazurkas include the same sixty-two-bar A–B–A version published in 1855 by former Chopin copyist Julian Fontana, based on a fair copy by cellist Auguste Franchomme, a close friend of the composer and dedicatee of his Cello Sonata. (The Henle edition exactly follows Franchomme's copy, which is more accurate in several respects than Fontana's published version.) But I was aware of a longer version from pianist Arthur Rubinstein's 1967 RCA recording of the complete Chopin mazurkas—a 1965 reconstruction by Polish pianist-musicologist Jan Ekier that adds a C section in F major. I purchased a copy of this A–B–A–C–A version and assumed I'd play it on my recital.<br></p><p>Looking up the work in Maurice Hinson's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Guide to the Pianist's Repertoire,</em> however, I learned of a more complete 1975 reconstruction by British pianist Ronald Smith as published by Hansen House. It turned out to be out of print, but I tracked down a copy via interlibrary loan. The C section in Smith's A–B–A–C–A version is thirtytwo bars, versus sixteen in Ekier's; in his foreword, Smith specifically criticizes Ekier's version, saying that it "takes a disastrous short-cut in the F major episode."<br></p><p>Wondering whether there had been any other published reconstructions, I of course did a Google search, which led me to "Chopin's Last Style," an article by the eminent Chopin authority Jeffrey Kallberg that appeared in the Summer 1985 issue of the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Journal of the American Musicological Society</em> and was republished with slight emendations as a chapter in his 1996 book <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Chopin at the Boundaries: Sex, History, and Musical Genre</em>. Kallberg contends that the piece's form is actually A–B–A–C–A–B–A, which struck me as the solution to one riddle in the sketch— the two different versions of the left hand of the B section's last measure (the second version is printed as an ossia passage in the Ekier and Smith editions). It seems likely that one version of that measure is intended for the first B section, the other for the second B.<br></p><p>Kallberg also provides a detailed summary of the various attempts to reconstruct the piece, which in turn led me to two other versions: an edition by Polish composer-pianist Milosz Magin, published in 1983 by Editions Concertino of Paris, and British pianist John Vallier's 1986 edition (now out of print) of a reconstruction by British musicologist Arthur Hedley, who as the first modern scholar to view the sketch in 1951 had discovered the long-missing C section. The thirty-two-bar C section in Magin's A–B–A–C–A version is structurally identical to Smith's. The form of the Hedley-Vallier version is (as Kallberg proposed) A–B– A–C–A–B–A, with the aforementioned slight variation at the end of the second B; but its final A section is oddly truncated, and the thirty-two-bar C section includes material that is clearly crossed out in the sketch.<br></p><p>In "Chopin's Last Style," Kallberg states that "numerous attempts have been made to decipher the document, none entirely successful." Playing through the four published versions, I couldn't help drawing the same conclusion; I could not see performing any of the four verbatim. So I thought I'd put together a composite version, just for my own personal use, incorporating the most convincing readings from the various editions.<br></p><p>But how does one make those decisions? My own sense of musical style, and of Chopin's style in particular, provided a general basis. Ultimately, though, I had to study the sketch itself, a facsimile of which was printed in several of the published editions.</p><p>One of the first spots I examined was a segment that Kallberg cites as having been omitted in previous reconstructions (Ekier, Magin, and Smith all fail to include it): the bass-clef passage that Chopin labeled 3ci (an abbreviation for <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">trzeci</em>, Polish for "third"). Kallberg's article interprets this segment as the left hand for the transition to the second B section, and the Hedley- Vallier edition adopts that interpretation as well. I took one look at this passage in the sketch and—to my great surprise—drew a completely different conclusion.</p><p>The passage consists of a quarter note and four eighth notes, connected by an ascending slur (the only slur in the entire sketch) that continues up and to the right of the last note; the beam over the eighth notes also continues up and to the right of the last note. To me, this looked like shorthand for an ascending tonic arpeggio that continues upwards (despite the fact that the last notated pitch is a D-flat, which sounds wrong even if the passage is used as a transition to the second A; Kallberg now conjectures that Chopin intended this note to be a C). And the function of the passage seemed clear to me as well: a little extra flourish to distinguish the final iteration of A as the end of the piece. Indeed, the A section ends three different ways—first leading to B, later leading to C, and finally ending the piece—and Chopin specifically labels this ending the "third." (I find it highly unlikely that the passage represents the second A-to-B transition. My examination of all the Chopin sectional dances—the mazurkas, polonaises, and waltzes—reveals that in A–B– A–C–A–B–A rondos where the first and second B sections are in the same key, the second transition from A to B is always identical to the first.)<br></p><p>But the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">3ci </em>passage isn't the only sketch segment that is typically omitted. At the end of the C section, Chopin wrote one measure above the staff in (presumably) treble clef and one measure plus a quarter note below the staff in bass clef. Ekier, Smith, and Magin include the former but omit the latter; Hedley-Vallier includes the latter but omits the former. No previous reconstruction had included every measure of the sketch that Chopin had not crossed out. So I made up my mind that my version would be the first—and this required figuring how to incorporate both these segments at the end of the C section. Thinking more as a composer than as a musicologist, I came up with a solution that seemed to make musical sense.<br></p><p>Barely had I drawn these conclusions than I began to question how I could have solved riddles that had stumped a whole series of eminent Chopin specialists. So first I sent my reconstruction to an esteemed scholar who has dealt extensively with another composer's manuscripts. She was quite encouraging, as were the other editors and teachers I then asked to review my work. Eventually I got up the nerve to send my version to Jeffrey Kallberg himself, who responded, "You've solved a number of puzzling passages that have eluded other researchers, including myself (I'm thinking especially of your very sensible rendition of measure 95 [the end of the C section])." He also generously provided a great deal of critical feedback that led to numerous improvements in both my reconstruction and the accompanying editorial notes.<br></p><p>By this time, I realized that my version might well be of interest to other pianists and scholars, so I began submitting it for publication, and fortunately Richard Walters of Hal Leonard decided to issue it as part of that company's Schirmer Performance Editions series. It appeared in print in 2012—the year after I gave its premiere performance on my last-completed-pianoworks recital.<br></p><p>All music schools try to link performance and scholarship. But sometimes, by pure serendipity, one leads seamlessly to the other—and then back again.<br></p></div></div>]]>

I would summarize it for you or offer pull-quotes but honestly you just have to read it yourself because it's mind-blowing. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19">The original article</a> is now deleted from the Johns Hopkins website ... for some reason. Luckily the internet is forever and it's available via<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19"> the Wayback Machine</a>. Here is the article in its entirety:</p><p>* * *</p><p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/21/covid-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths">new data</a>, the U.S. currently ranks first in total COVID-19 cases, new cases per day and deaths. Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master's degree program at Hopkins, critically analyzed the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in her webinar titled "COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data."</p><p>From mid-March to mid-September, U.S. total deaths have reached 1.7 million, of which 200,000, or 12% of total deaths, are COVID-19-related. Instead of looking directly at COVID-19 deaths, Briand focused on total deaths per age group and per cause of death in the U.S. and used this information to shed light on the effects of COVID-19.</p><p>She explained that the significance of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths can be fully understood only through comparison to the number of total deaths in the United States.</p><p>After retrieving data on the CDC website, Briand compiled a graph representing percentages of total deaths per age category from early February to early September, which includes the period from before COVID-19 was detected in the U.S. to after infection rates soared.</p><p>Surprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same.</p><p>"The reason we have a higher number of reported COVID-19 deaths among older individuals than younger individuals is simply because every day in the U.S. older individuals die in higher numbers than younger individuals," Briand said.</p><p>Briand also noted that 50,000 to 70,000 deaths are seen both before and after COVID-19, indicating that this number of deaths was normal long before COVID-19 emerged. Therefore, according to Briand, not only has COVID-19 had no effect on the percentage of deaths of older people, but it has also not increased the total number of deaths.</p><p>These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people's assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.</p><p>This comes as a shock to many people. How is it that the data lie so far from our perception?</p><p>To answer that question, Briand shifted her focus to the deaths per causes ranging from 2014 to 2020. There is a sudden increase in deaths in 2020 due to COVID-19. This is no surprise because COVID-19 emerged in the U.S. in early 2020, and thus COVID-19-related deaths increased drastically afterward.</p><p>Analysis of deaths per cause in 2018 revealed that the pattern of seasonal increase in the total number of deaths is a result of the rise in deaths by all causes, with the top three being heart disease, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia.</p><p>"This is true every year. Every year in the U.S. when we observe the seasonal ups and downs, we have an increase of deaths due to all causes," Briand pointed out.</p><p>When Briand looked at the 2020 data during that seasonal period, COVID-19-related deaths exceeded deaths from heart diseases. This was highly unusual since heart disease has always prevailed as the leading cause of deaths. However, when taking a closer look at the death numbers, she noted something strange. As Briand compared the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018, she noticed that instead of the expected drastic increase across all causes, there was a significant decrease in deaths due to heart disease. Even more surprising, as seen in the graph below, this sudden decline in deaths is observed for all other causes.</p><mediatag id="57319"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018.</i></p><p>This trend is completely contrary to the pattern observed in all previous years. Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading. Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19.</p><mediatag id="57320"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the total decrease in deaths by various causes, including COVID-19.</i></p><p>The CDC classified all deaths that are related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths. Even patients dying from other underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths. This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease.</p><p>"All of this points to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths. Total death numbers are not above normal death numbers. We found no evidence to the contrary," Briand concluded.</p><p>In an interview with <i>The News-Letter</i>, Briand addressed the question of whether COVID-19 deaths can be called misleading since the infection might have exacerbated and even led to deaths by other underlying diseases.</p><p>"If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn't give us a choice but to point to some misclassification," Briand replied.</p><p>In other words, the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the U.S. is considered problematic only when it increases the total number of deaths or the true death burden by a significant amount in addition to the expected deaths by other causes. Since the crude number of total deaths by all causes before and after COVID-19 has stayed the same, one can hardly say, in Briand's view, that COVID-19 deaths are concerning.</p><p>Briand also mentioned that more research and data are needed to truly decipher the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the United States.</p><p>Throughout the talk, Briand constantly emphasized that although COVID-19 is a serious national and global problem, she also stressed that society should never lose focus of the bigger picture — death in general.</p><p>The death of a loved one, from COVID-19 or from other causes, is always tragic, Briand explained. Each life is equally important and we should be reminded that even during a global pandemic we should not forget about the tragic loss of lives from other causes.</p><p>According to Briand, the over-exaggeration of the COVID-19 death number may be due to the constant emphasis on COVID-19-related deaths and the habitual overlooking of deaths by other natural causes in society.</p><p>During an interview with <i>The</i> <i>News-Letter </i>after the event, Poorna Dharmasena, a master's candidate in Applied Economics, expressed his opinion about Briand's concluding remarks.</p><p>"At the end of the day, it's still a deadly virus. And over-exaggeration or not, to a certain degree, is irrelevant," Dharmasena said.</p><p>When asked whether the public should be informed about this exaggeration in death numbers, Dharmasena stated that people have a right to know the truth. However, COVID-19 should still continuously be treated as a deadly disease to safeguard the vulnerable population.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Facebook and Twitter will certainly block this article within hours of its publication. Just like Johns Hopkins deleted it from its site. The question is ... why?</p><mediatag id="57334"></mediatag><mediatag id="57329"></mediatag><mediatag id="57331"></mediatag><mediatag id="57332"></mediatag><p>* * *</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: JHU tweeted that they deleted the article because it "was being used to support false and dangerous inaccuracies about the impact of the pandemic."</p><mediatag id="57420"></mediatag><p>Importantly, they didn't say anything in the article was incorrect. So we're just memory-holing studies that don't align with the narrative? Got it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1606480641864" id="item-5fc0f2d33f75b16643f61aae"><div><div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-3e269a4e320cdf7cc7e4"><div><p data-preserve-html-node="true">This is a follow-up post to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://finestructure.co/blog/2020/11/27/running-docker-on-apple-silicon-m1">“Running Docker on Apple Silicon M1”</a>, continuing the journey of exploring Docker on Apple’s new M1 machines.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">We left off at booting an ARM Linux virtual machine, and installing &amp; running Docker inside it. This works fine and allows you run containers like for instance a Postgres database. They can expose their ports and instead of connecting to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">localhost:5432</code> on the host, you connect to your VM’s IP address, for instance <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.8:5432</code>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now in case you’re not aware, Docker is actually a service that exposes an API over HTTP and when you run <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> commands, they control the service via these API requests on a local socket. You’ve probably seen the reference to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">unix:///var/run/docker.sock</code> at times.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What that means is that it’s possible to direct your <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> client to talk to a Docker service over the network, and that’s what we can do as well to enable “regular” docker commands to work with a locally running “Linux Docker VM”.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Incidentally, that’s exactly what “Docker for Mac” is doing under the hood: it is actually a <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/moby/hyperkit">VM based on Apple’s Hypervisor framework</a> which hosts Docker, not your Mac itself.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Installing “Docker for Mac”</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to get started, we need to obtain the Docker client app. I migrated my existing setup from a Time Machine backup and therefore had Docker installed from the start. If you need to install from scratch, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/">installing the client binaries</a> is probably the easiest way to get started.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Assuming you have a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> binary to hand, you’re good to go. The way we’ll set up the connection is via a “docker context” and all this is <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/johannesweiss/status/1332271974719090688?s=21">thanks to a tip by Johannes Weiss</a>.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up SSH in virtual machine</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">First though, we need to configure to connect to our VM via SSH. Install the SSH server:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and copy your public key to the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">ubuntu</code> user’s <code data-preserve-html-node="true">authorized_keys</code> for password-less access.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to connect to the VM, you’ll need to find its IP address (which is on a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.0</code> network if you’ve followed along from the previous blog post).</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Our image comes without <code data-preserve-html-node="true">net-tools</code>, so we’ll install these first:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt install net-tools</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and then run</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">which should yield the following</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="8cf9eef9e2f8f9ccf9eef9e2f8f9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:<span>~</span>$ ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168
        inet 192.168.64.8  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.64.255</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">With all this out of the way, we can test the connection from the host:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ssh <a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="98edfaedf6ecedd8a9a1aab6a9aea0b6aeacb6a0">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code></pre>

<figure data-preserve-html-node="true"><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/finestructure-public-images/posts/ssh-login.png"></figure>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up a Docker context</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The remaining steps are simple. We create a Docker context:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="3d485f485349487d0c040f130c0b05130b091305">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span></code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and tell Docker to use it</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context use myvm</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now all docker commands are targeting the virtual machine, just like they do in Docker for Mac.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">❯ docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="a3d6c1d6cdd7d6e3929a918d92959b8d95978d9b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
myvm
Successfully created context <span>"myvm"</span>
<span>~</span>
❯ docker context use myvm
myvm
<span>~</span>
❯ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
<span>~</span>
❯ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker<span>!</span>
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the <span>"hello-world"</span> image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">You can find out more about <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context</code> in the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/working-with-contexts">online documentation</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Bear in mind that this setup does not come with the convenience of Docker for Mac’s bridge networking or support for volumes – but surely these aren’t far off.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My digital life in a nutshell: I discover relevant content I don’t have time to consume, I find time and become overwhelmed with my scattered backlog, I wish the content were in a different format, and then I’m unable to find something again once I’ve consumed it. <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Not retaining enough</a> is a valid problem but we’ll tackle that one later.</p><p>There’s a lot of generalization in my summary but <strong>the core issue is an extraordinarily high level of friction in the process of finding, organizing, and sharing digital content</strong>. During the past few years I’ve noticed:</p><ul><li><p>The more seamless the acquisition &amp; ingestion, the more engaged I am with the content</p></li><li><p>Insights are just as likely to be found in a 400-page book as in a 40-minute podcast</p></li><li><p>Notes and their subsequent review are essential for long-term retention</p></li><li><p>Recommendations from other humans are as good, if not better, than algorithmic suggestions</p></li></ul><p>In the rest of this post I attempt to explain the digital tools I wish existed, and how the the currently available tools do not suffice. What are also probably lacking are my <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">habits and workflows</a> around this - but I’m looking at tools specifically here.</p><h2 id="queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">Queue management for inbound digital content&nbsp;<a href="#queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">#</a></h2><p>Where to begin? Probably the most common problem I see myself and other people dealing with is processing the incoming deluge of articles to read and videos to watch. This isn’t all personal recommendations - it encompasses any and all content I think my future self would appreciate me consuming. A list of issues, roughly by order of appearance:</p><ul><li><p>Content (or links to it) arrive from a variety of sources including text messages from friends, email conversations, tweetstorms and replies, references in books, suggestions in real-world conversations, and more.</p></li><li><p>Every book, article, post, or tweet has the potential to lead to more content.</p></li><li><p>Content is published in a variety of formats including but not limited to images, sound files, videos, Google Drive docs, diagrams, long-form paywalled articles, PDFs, powerpoint presentations, and base 64 encoded blobs.</p></li><li><p>I have little visibility into required time investment and foundational context until I’ve opened it and started thinking about it. Should I sit down with a pen and paper to read this or can I skim it while waiting for my coffee?</p></li><li><p>Learning, work, news, and entertainment all have different priorities in my life (roughly in that order).</p></li><li><p>I would like to batch process content in different “streams” regardless of where they are stored. For example: I have two hours, let me work through interesting text content my friends sent me last week. Or: show me all the interesting/relevant videos I’ve queued over the past month.</p></li><li><p>I’m not always connected to a stable internet connection.</p></li><li><p>If it’s a long piece of content I want my position saved reliably so I can resume at a later point.</p></li><li><p>I often want it in a different format than the one it was originally published in (audio → text, text → audio, pdf → ebook). Automated conversion works but is cumbersome. Listening to text articles requires sending them to a special app and converting articles to ebooks is annoying and loses a lot of formatting and navigation.</p></li><li><p>I love to respond to a person’s recommendation - preferably before they’ve forgotten why they sent me it in the first place.</p></li><li><p>I’d like a centralized history of content tied to my notes and annotations in case I want to find it again later. It feels like every week I’m speaking with someone and I remember a blog post I read a few months ago they might find relevant … or was it a Reddit post? Can I find it my history? Oh no, it’s been replaced with <code>[deleted]</code> … find an archived copy… rinse and repeat.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/icon_swap.png"><figcaption>Relevant XKCD, as is tradition</figcaption></figure><p>Following my curiosity feels like chasing a caffeinated bunny around while real understanding requires time, perspective, and reflection. The internet makes the former much easier - so I find myself constantly balancing the two. Additionally, my energy and attention levels vary throughout the day and it’s far easier to just open Twitter rather than continue reading a long-form article I started on my laptop two days ago. Too often I default to the lower-friction one.</p><p>Honorable Mentions: <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a></p><h2 id="a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">A universal book log, recommendation &amp; sharing system&nbsp;<a href="#a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">#</a></h2><p>I love exploring other peoples’ reading lists. Here’s <a href="https://jon.bo/books">my own</a>. I find everyone keeps their reading lists in different formats on different platforms. Plaintext lists are nice but hard to parse. Spreadsheets are easy to parse but a pain to manage. Third-party services aren’t interoperable, require logins, and are not future-proof.</p><p>Part of the problem here is <a href="https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm">metadata is hard</a>. Someone has to sit there and fill out the author, title, subtitle, summary, page count - and they’re probably not going to do it for free. Amazon is a good at it but <a href="https://stallman.org/amazon.html#publishing">is hostile to publishers</a>. Goodreads has much potential but <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/almost-everything-about-goodreads-is-broken-662e424244d5">seems to have stagnated</a>. Linking to the book’s Wikipedia entry would be my preference but very few books have an entry.</p><p>Whatever this tool for managing my ever-growing reading list will be, it should:</p><ul><li><p>Let me compare my reading list with another to see overlap. I find this a wonderful way to spark conversation and find common interests.</p></li><li><p>Allow me to tag books instead of placing them into static lists (think clusters or tag clouds).</p></li><li><p>Be tied to my highlights, annotations, and bookmarks in a non-proprietary, searchable, and shareable format. Make them public if I want to.</p></li><li><p>Save context on where and when I found this book: why I thought it was important to read, when I read it, what I wrote down while reading it, and what other content I discovered through it.</p></li><li><p>Let me query this tool like a relational database. For example: show me all books about scaling startups recommended by people I follow on Twitter or by people they follow. The current Twitter search makes me feel like I’m using a government site created before I myself even knew what a computer was.</p></li><li><p>Help me <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kmch6T2YscMyLFJD9/rational-reading-thoughts-on-prioritizing-books">deal with prioritization</a>. My reading list is a mess and I can’t be alone. Are certain books better read before others? Prerequisites? Could three of them be replaced with one? What are the other books by the this author? Are they worth reading too? Why exactly did I think reading this 800 page book was relevant when I added it? <a href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/health-fitness/the-checklist-manifesto/">Is 80% of the content attainable from a blog post?</a> Where is that post?

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:

42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

    <p>As many of us have experienced during school years, late-night learning is not the most effective technique. The information might have stuck around for a short period, but just after the day of the exam, it flew away with us unable to recall it. If you would like to remember more during and after your studies, forget the last-minute learning. Using spaced repetition, a method to rehearse educational material, you will not simply earn better grades, but studying would be an overall easier process and memorized information will be available to recall later in your life.</p>

<p>The spaced repetition system is a learning technique in which the material previously learned is recalled by the learner from time to time at ever-increasing intervals. This method is based on the intermittent repetition effect on how we tend to forget information. The primary goal of the technique is to recall the material learned as infrequently as possible, just before we forget it. By approaching repetitions in this scientific way, time spent learning can be used much more efficiently.</p>
<h2>The neurological background of memorizing</h2>
<p>Learning always begins with perception, the form of how we collect information. This data travels through the nerve pathways to the place where the perception is processed, our brain. Some perceptions cause our bodies to react, which usually does not happen consciously.</p>
<p>Scientists once thought that the brain stores memories in a similar way to computers. It was later proved that the artificial approach is completely different: information is broken down into elements (bits) on the computer and is stored that way. The machines can store up to a certain amount of information on a storage device called a hard disk. If our brain would work similarly, despite having hundreds of billions of cells, our internal storage device would have filled up in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Our brains work in a rather different way: since we always store information in context it is more about capturing the contents of things. That’s why when we recall a memory, related reminiscences come to mind, like smells or the color of the paper, or what we ate for dinner during learning.</p>
<h2>What makes spaced repetition so effective?</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition technique is one of the most effective learning techniques, which you probably use even if you do not know about it. Using this method consciously makes it far superior to standard learning.</p>
<p>There are three key values it provides:</p>
<div>
<p>Delays forgetting learned information by prolonging the forget-curve.</p>
<p>Active recall helps to keep memorized information fresh (as the context layers build-up, it gets easier to remember what you have learned).</p>
<p>Spaced repetition supports long term memory, so you won’t forget the learned information even after the exam.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to get started with the spaced repetition system?</h2>
<p>To put the above in practice, try to remember a movie you’ve seen more than one time. After you’ve watched it first, you understood it well, but a few weeks later you only remembered the title and main story points. You watched it with a friend two months later, and while watching, you have realized that you can recall the story and started to watch out for certain details in the background, or the listening closer to the music. When you watched it for the third time, you probably remembered all the names, a few exact quotes, and the story details too.</p>
<p>Of course, the typical study materials are far from a movie’s excitement, however, learning it works the same. Review your documents and memorize them for the first time. After you have finished, try recalling them in a suitable way: you can write them down or simply rehearse the answers out loud. (Trying to recall it through your inner voice is not the best idea as we all tend to cheat ourselves.)</p>
<p>If you recalled it correctly, put the documents down and start another activity. After an hour try to rehearse it again, maybe using a different method. Then again in a few hours, and on the next day morning. Keep lengthening these intervals until you are ready to face the exam.</p>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>Luckily, today we have multiple choices on how to organize our studies. Different websites, along with applications, will help to study faster and also memorize for the long-term. Let’s see 5 software programs and applications utilizing the spaced repetition system!</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quizlet</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.png" alt="Quizlet logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This is an application that you can use either through your browser or on any mobile device. With one account you can have all your data synchronized, so you can continue your studies away from the computer when it is time to repeat!</p>
<p>The basic idea of Quizlet is that you can search for subjects that already have their case sets and use those, or you can create your own “memorizing cards”. Just enter the term and the definition, and after you are ready, you can start the learning process. Quizlet is also utilized for high-level education and corporate usage, ranging from healthcare studies to Starbucks training programs.</p>
<p>The app is available for students and teachers as well. If you get the vibe of this tool and you want to support it, for a low amount of monthly payment you can also purchase Quizlet Go or Plus for wider and advanced toolkits to create enhanced study sets.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> After creating or choosing your flashcard set, you can start to memorize the information. When you feel ready, you can choose how to check your knowledge. First is the “Learning” phase: Quizlet will show you the term and you will have to answer it from multiple choices or you will have to type it from memory - and the software will immediately review it. Getting it correctly will set the term as “Familiar”, and after multiple times it will be changed to “Mastered”. Furthermore, this spaced repetition app will give you constant feedback based on your answers, where you are in the learning process, and what you should focus on.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.edapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EdApp</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.png" alt="EdApp logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Signing up for EdApp will give you a choice if you want to educate others or yourself. The registration is fast, and you can immediately create your topic or search in the content library based on your interest.</p>
<p>The contents will be summarized using texts, gifs, and short videos because visualization had a great positive effect on memorizing capabilities. The presentations also have interactive parts, triggering the mind with the element of surprise, stabilizing the learned information. While you are stepping further, EdApp will give you milestones to know where you are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> With its sophisticated approach and triggering effects, this spaced repetition software helps to improve memorizing information. On its finalizing page it summarizes the studied content, and based on your answers it gives feedback.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.png" alt="Anki logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and any device with a web browser</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Anki is a simple, ad-free software that helps you to create flashcards. After downloading it to your computer or on your mobile phone, the first step is to generate decks, which will include flashcards. All cards have a front- and a backside that you can fill up with information. Also, you can insert pictures and other notes from your classes, so you can memorize those as well. You can also grade the difficulty of the lesson. Anki is mostly used by college students (especially in healthcare). It runs offline, and its ad-free, transparent user interface won’t cause any disturbance during studying.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Based on how difficult you have found the lecture, the program will offer you three choices to choose from: to see the lesson again in one minute or to repeat it in ten minutes or four days.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.brainscape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainscape</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.png" alt="Brainscape logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, Android, iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Brainscape is a specialized spaced repetition system where the algorithm focuses on the areas which need improvements, based on your answers and learning patterns. This is a lively web surface because their team is openly active on other social media websites and showing their results and feedback from users and companies, furthermore, a blog, full of content, is available as well.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Brainscape will effectively monitor and check your answers and will support you - if you are honest how well you have known the flash cards’ answers, based on a scale from 1 to 5. It will also measure time during your study phases and help you to memorize information faster.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://smartcardsplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartCards+</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.png" alt="SmartCards+ logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Smartcards will support your studies with a learning curve, measure the optimal time, and suggest when to repeat your studies. This spaced repetition app is only available for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Its classical surface will help you not simply with drag and drop text flashcards, but you can also insert video and audio files to support the memorization process. Furthermore, typing an answer is also an option during the learning phase, and the program will color results to show if you were correct or not.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning accompanies us throughout our entire life, while as we age studying gets harder. Spaced repetition is a good-to-know tactic (or even life-hack) that you might have used before without consciously knowing it. Utilizing the method through one of the above spaced repetition software apps will help you to memorize learning materials more effectively and in less time. The method comes handy in all ages, regardless if you go to school, prepare for college exams, or do corporate training to develop your career.</p>

<![CDATA[SQLite as a Document Database]]>
            </title>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>SQLite has had JSON support for a while.</p>

<p>However recently it added a killer feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html">generated
columns</a>. (This was added in 3.31.0,
released 2020-01-22.)</p>

<p>This makes it possible to insert JSON straight into SQLite and then have it
extract data and index them, i.e. you can treat SQLite as a document database.
This has been possible with PostgreSQL and obviously is what something like
Elastic provides but having it available in an embedded database is very nice
for lightweight stuff.</p>

<p>Let's get started:</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE t (
   body TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.d')) VIRTUAL);
sqlite&gt; insert into t values(json('{"d":"42"}'));
sqlite&gt; select * from t WHERE d = 42;
{"d":"42"}|42
</code></pre>

<p>It's that simple, the <code>d</code> column is extracted from the provided JSON.</p>

<p>(Aside: The hard bit may be getting a new enough SQLite, at the time of writing
Homebrew on macOS has it, else you likely need to use an unstable source like
nixpkgs-unstable.)</p>

<p>There's some nice properties of this. Normally it's encouraged to minifiy and
validate JSON when inserting (via the <code>json()</code> function) as because SQLite
doesn't have a JSON type it will allow anything. However nothing enforces that,
you could add a constraint but will probably forget... Having <code>GENERATED ALWAYS</code>
using <code>json_extract</code> means invalid JSON will get a <code>Error: malformed JSON</code> at
INSERT time.</p>

<p>This can be taken further:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE x (
  body TEXT,
  id TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.id')) VIRTUAL NOT NULL);
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('');
Error: malformed JSON
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('{}');
Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: x.id
</code></pre>

<p>We can enforce items are present in the inserted JSON, here by adding <code>NOT
NULL</code>, but we could also use constraints and other SQLite features!</p>

<p>You'll notice I've used <code>VIRTUAL</code> with the generated column in these examples.
There's also the option of using <code>STORED</code> to essentially cache the values,
although a downside is you can't add those columns via <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.</p>

<p>However you can always create an index on a column, even if it's defined a
virtual one:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX xid on x(id);</code></pre>

<p>Then check that's going to work as expected:
</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM x WHERE id='foo';
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE x USING INDEX xid (id=?)
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with ALTER TABLE we can add a new column and index it:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE x ADD COLUMN text TEXT
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.text')) VIRTUAL;
INSERT INTO x VALUES(json('{"id":43, "text":"test"}'));
CREATE INDEX xtext ON x(text);
</code></pre>

<p>
The benefit here is you can start off with a table which could be as simple as
just a single JSON column, and add columns and indexes as you find useful data
in that JSON. For example this can work really well for webhooks, insert all the
data you are sent straight into a table, then pull out the useful stuff later.
Have fun.
</p>

</div><p>Swiss public television, SRF, has found a second company besides Crypto AG&nbsp;was involved in manufacturing manipulated devices allegedly used for spying by foreign intelligence.</p>
<span>This content was published on November 26, 2020 - 11:34</span>
<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

For example, it integrates with the rest of the home security system — using machine learning to identify humans, cars, animals, and more:</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg.webp 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg.webp 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg.webp 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg.webp 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg.webp 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg.webp 442w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" alt="DIY smart doorbell detects a guest visitor with AI computer vision" width="1024" height="1024" title="Detecting a person approaching" srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-1024x1024.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w"></picture><figcaption>The smart doorbell uses TensorFlow to detect people, cars, animals, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p><h2><span id="Designing_the_Smart_Doorbell"></span>Designing the Smart Doorbell<span></span></h2><p>Doorbells live outside.</p><p>Okay, that’s obvious. But it was my first electronic project that needed to <em>survive the elements</em>. To that end, I decided to use a <strong>junction box</strong> to house the electronics themselves.</p><p>The next requirement was also obvious: a <strong>button</strong>. However, the concern with such a unique design is that visitors need to intuitively understand <em>what the device is</em>. I decided upon a durable metal button that also lights up.

This is arguably the most important security camera in the entire house, and I didn’t have a lot of space in the junction box, so I splurged on a <strong>night-vision IR camera</strong> with a microphone built-in.

It also can detect which user pin code was used to open the door (and when) — great peace of mind when giving cleaners a code to the house.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png.webp 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png.webp 768w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" alt="home assistant motioneye camera" width="947" height="717" title="Home Assistant " srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-947x717.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w"></picture><figcaption>Home Assistant connects to MotionEye to show the camera, motion alerts, and other detections.</figcaption></figure><p>But, most importantly, it can be locked/unlocked with a tap in Home Assistant.</p><h2><span id="Source_Code_Recap"></span>Source Code: Recap<span></span></h2><p>I wish I could give you copy-and-paste code for this project, but a lot of it will depend on your exact hardware, speakers, cameras, etc. Instead, I’ll recap each piece involved and link to the articles/code where I explain how to implement them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/node-red-docker-kubernetes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Node Red uses gpiod</a> to trigger a flow when GPIO #18 (the doorbell button) fires.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/loudspeaker-network-intercoms-alerts/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">loudspeaker alert flow plays a wav file</a>.</li><li>I have <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">multiple DIY speakers</a> that play the alert around the house.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/diy-dashcam-raspberry-pi-zero-w-motion-eye/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">MotionEye drives the camera</a>, capturing stills and videos.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/iot/cctv-security-cameras/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">CCTV Security Cameras</a> handle person/object detection.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/tag/home-assistant/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant’s</a> Yale Lock integration allows us to lock/unlock.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154
1.5921412270130977e+77
4.8915590244884904e+38
2.7093655358260904e+19

42.92431640625
42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>I am writing this post because Thunderbird 78.x has issues for advanced PGP users. But first, I’d like to say a few words to all the frustrated users: I hear you, I too am displeased with this update, but while it’s easy to complain and rant, we should look at the bright side and still be grateful that Mozilla thought of including PGP, as it makes it more accessible to users that are not as tech-savvy. It’s always good to push for privacy and having it built-in, and easy to use! But, there are issues with the new built-in PGP that we should talk about…</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You know, as I stated in <a href="https://www.sindastra.de/p/1566/open-letter-why-it-security-is-obvious-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my open letter</a>: Security and privacy is important to me. Of course, this means I use PGP, or more specifically, GnuPG with smartcards.</p>
<p>I like FOSS, especially if it’s cross-platform as I use Linux, Mac and Windows (alphabetical order, no preference stated) and it’s great to be able to use your software on all your machines across all systems, and for free! The popular email client, Thunderbird is one such application that meets these criteria, and so is GnuPG (or GPG for short), a popular application that implements the OpenPGP specification.</p>
<p>GnuPG has a ton of features, among those features is the support of smartcards. Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the situation in Thunderbird before, and then since version 78.x and what we can do about it.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>before</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>Before Thunderbird 78.x (namely 68.x), if you had both Thunderbird and GnuPG installed, all you had to do was to install a Thunderbird addon known as Enigmail. This addon basically bridged the gap between Thunderbird and GnuPG, and essentially allowed you to experience full PGP within Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Of course this meant you had to install GnuPG on your system, then an addon, then generate and manage keys, and – although powerful – it was overall not as user-friendly as it could be.</p>
<p>So, even I as an advanced user, was excited that Thunderbird would come with PGP built-in in 78.x as I thought they might ship it with GnuPG, and something like Enigmail but built-in and maybe more user-friendly. At the very least having no third-party things to install sounds better. And convenience is nice, right? But I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>since</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>You see, Mozilla, the people behind Thunderbird did not ship it with GnuPG. Instead, they use a library called RNP. This library does not provide full-featured PGP.</p>
<p>RNP does for example, not support the use of smartcards. Which, basically means no PGP at all for me or any user with smartcards. Thunderbird does currently also not support using subkeys with detached primary key. Which means any advanced user that did a proper, more secure PGP setup, can also not use PGP with Thunderbird for the time being.</p>
<p>So, you might think to yourself: Just install Enigmail! Well, here’s the thing: Enigmail does not work with Thunderbird 78.x!</p>
<p>Thunderbird 78.x has hidden settings in the advanced configuration editor, that you can use to tell it to use external GnuPG, which is great! Except it doesn’t really work…</p>
<p>It did not work for me, and I tried many things, on different systems, followed different guides (including the official Mozilla Wiki), and heard the same from other users through the fediverse. For a friend of mine, setting up Thunderbird to use external GnuPG on Windows made it outright crash whenever trying to open a PGP encrypted email!</p>
<p>And this is basically the problem. On one hand, Mozilla was cool enough to include (some) PGP in Thunderbird which in theory makes it more accessible as you can generate and use keys with a few clicks, which is also good for us advanced users as we can then email privately with friends that would otherwise be unable to use PGP. But on the other hand the execution was bad in such a way that it stabs all the advanced users that were already using (advanced setups of) PGP.</p>
<h2>What to do about it (for now)</h2>
<p>Honestly, my advice to anyone that uses Thunderbird and depends on advanced PGP (smartcard etc.) for now: Just downgrade to Thunderbird 68.x and install Enigmail. It seems it will still receive updates for now and there’s no forced update to 78.x (yet). I just tried, and got an (undocumented) update for the 68.x version (namely 68.12.1).</p>
<p>Let’s hope they will keep providing security updates for 68.x until they have (hopefully) sorted out PGP in version 78.x so that we will eventually be able to upgrade, but without being pushed into a broken environment prematurely.</p>
<p>You can get the latest version of 68.x from here (official download link): <a href="https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/</a></p>
<p>Please note that, Thunderbird will notice that the current configuration is from a newer version after downgrading, which you cannot use. This will result in a little window informing you about that on startup. Your only two options are to quit the application, or to create a new (configuration) profile. This means you will have to set up your accounts again but at least PGP will work again (with Enigmail and GnuPG)!</p>
<p>Thank you and goodnight! :D</p>
<h2>UPDATE 2020-NOV-29</h2>
<p>Hey everyone, this article drew many visitors after it was posted on HN (thanks, kind stranger!) and I did read through the comments (both here and some on HN)!</p>
<p>I’d like to address some things:</p>
<ol><li>I saw a tl;dr on HN which mentioned the downgrade recommendation, but without the details. As I understood it, it got criticized as you need to stay up to day for security reasons. And I agree with that. However, I’d like to make it clear that I only recommended a downgrade for now, as it seems the 68.x branch is still getting updates, as I experienced myself. As long as Thunderbird does not drop support for 68.x, and does not force an upgrade to 78.x, I think downgrading is fine. When Thunderbird finally drops support for 68.x, I would of course not recommend staying on outdated software.</li><li>When Thunderbird 68.x reaches EOL, and if 78.x hasn’t sorted out the issues with PGP by then, an alternative, if you’re on Windows and have MS Outlook, would be the free GpgOL extension for Outlook that comes bundled with Gpg4win. Please note that I don’t have experience with this myself, but I’d like to point it out anyway in case it’s useful. There’s also a (paid) Apple Mail extension that comes with gpgtools, however I do not recommend it unless you don’t mind paying for each new major version every year.</li><li>Thank you for informing me that Thunderbird is not part of Mozilla Corporation anymore, but as I understood it, still part of Mozilla Foundation. So, I guess in that case I’m addressing the Mozilla foundation. If this is still wrong, please let me know.</li></ol>
<p>PS I was exhausted and it was late at night when I originally wrote this article, and I wasn’t fully happy with it but people seemed to like it and had very constructive feedback which really helps. Thank you all for stopping by and reading it! &lt;3</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_5">Chang’e 5</a> is a Chinese lunar sample return mission. It was launched a few days ago on 2020-11-23 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchang_Satellite_Launch_Center">Wenchang</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782149490413568">is estimated</a> to perform lunar orbit injection on Saturday. Since then, a number of Amateurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/usa_satcom/status/1331092113069543425">USA Satcom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/uhf_satcom/status/1331317024992210944">Paul Marsh M0EYT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331138035891650560">Scott Tilley VE7TIL</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/supertrack_it/status/1331354629146365953">Fer IW1DTU</a> and others have been receiving the X-band signals from the spacecraft and posting reports over on Twitter. Meanwhile, <a href="http://r00t.cz/">r00t.cz</a> has been working in <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331097492482646016">decoding the frames</a>, which has led him to the amazing achievement of being able to <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/Sats/Change5">retrieve a short video</a> from the signal.</p>



<p>In this post I will look at some of the frames demodulated by USA Satcom and Paul during the first couple of days of the mission. The frame structure has many similarities with Tianwen-1, which I have described in several posts, such as <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-telemetry-framing-and-data/" data-type="post" data-id="8773">here</a> and <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/" data-type="post" data-id="8871">here</a>. However, there are some interesting differences.</p>



<h4>Low data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The low data rate telemetry signal is a PCM/PSK/PM signal with a subcarrier rate of 65536 Hz and a baudrate of 2048 baud. The coding is CCSDS concatenated frames with a Reed-Solomon codeword size of 252 bytes, so that a frame takes 2 seconds to transmit. The Reed-Solomon code uses the dual basis, as specified in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/131x0b3e1.pdf">TM Synchronization and Channel Coding</a> blue book. This is very similar to Tianwen-1’s low rate signal. The only differences are that Tianwen-1 uses a baudrate of 16384 baud (so frames take 0.25 seconds to transmit), and the conventional Reed-Solomon basis (which is not standard CCSDS).</p>



<p>Chang’e 5 has been seen to use <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782140900503556">a number of different frequencies</a> at X-band. Here I will be looking at some frames received by USA Satcom on 2020-11-24 between 4 and 6 UTC.</p>



<p>The frames are CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/732x0b3e1.pdf">AOS frames</a> coming from spacecraft ID 91. The spacecraft ID is quite relevant, because the spacecraft has different detachable modules: a service module, a return module, a lander, and an ascent module. Most likely each of these modules uses a different spacecraft ID, and we are in fact seeing data from different spacecraft IDs.</p>



<p>Two virtual channels are in use. Virtual channel 1 contains most of the data (a total of 5888 frames), while virtual channel 2 contains only 5 frames.</p>



<p>The AOS frames in both virtual channels have an insert zone that is 8 bytes long. The purpose of the first 4 bytes is unknown, while the last 4 bytes are a little-endian timestamp encoded as the number of seconds elapsed since 2012-08-01 00:00:00 UTC. It is interesting to compare this timestamp format with <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/more-about-the-tianwen-1-timestamps/" data-type="post" data-id="8734">that used in Tianwen-1</a>, which uses a 48 bit big-endian timestamp that encodes 100us units since 2016-01-01 00:00:00 Beijing time. The change from big-endian to little-endian is peculiar, since somehow the CCSDS protocols favour big-endian fields, and the change from a Beijing time epoch to a UTC epoch is also an interesting curiosity.</p>



<p>The M_PDU protocol is used to multiplex CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf">Space Packets</a> in the AOS frames.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and virtual channel frame counter in the frames from virtual channel 1. The gaps correspond to time gaps between the different files provided by USA Satcom.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>The Space Packets in virtual channel 1 use many different APIDs. I have been browsing through the plots of the data in each of the APIDs and they look reminiscent of Tianwen-1. There are many analogue telemetry channels, but I haven’t been able to spot any that has an obvious meaning, and there doesn’t seem to be any floating point data as in Tianwen-1. Here I show a few of the most interesting APIDs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524-644x654.png" alt="" width="483" height="491" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524-644x654.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524-295x300.png 295w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524-768x780.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524.png 903w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></a></figure>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-644x649.png" alt="" width="483" height="487" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-644x649.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-298x300.png 298w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-768x774.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></a></figure>



<p>The five frames in virtual channel 2 were transmitted consecutively, perhaps in response to a telecommand. Each of them contains a single Space Packet from APID 897 that occupies all the frame.</p>



<p>The data from these Space Packets looks like some kind of file download or memory dump. The first 8 bytes contain three fixed bytes that maybe identify the file or the region of memory followed by a 5 byte little-endian chunk counter. The transfer here uses only 5 chunks, and most of the data in the last chunk is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding bytes. The figure below shows the data in this transfer, with one chunk per row. The data clearly shows patterns, but I have no idea what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="187" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-300x87.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-768x223.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Chang’e transfer in APID 897</figcaption></figure>



<p>The code and data used in this part of the post, including the full plots of all the APIDs, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>



<h4>High data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The high data rate telemetry uses 2.5Mbaud BPSK <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331351055972642818">according to r00t</a>. Coding is, as in the case of <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/">Tianwen-1 high data rate long frames</a>, concatenated CCSDS frames using four interleaved Reed-Solomon codewords (with 255 bytes each).</p>



<p>The data used here is a short segment received by Paul on 2020-11-24 between 20:52 and 20:58 UTC at 8455 MHz. It is quite interesting to see the errors corrected by the Reed-Solomon decoder, which show large variability but indicate that Paul has more than enough SNR margin to decode the signal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png 612w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></a></figure>



<p>The data consists of AOS frames from spacecraft ID 26 (note this is a different spacecraft ID to the one in the low rate data used in the previous part). Virtual channels 38 and 63 are in use, with 18396 and 51850 frames respectively.</p>



<p>In contrast to the AOS frames used for the low data rate telemetry, here the AOS insert zone is only 6 bytes long, with 2 unknown bytes that always contain the value <code>0xf0f0</code> followed by a 4 byte timestamp using the same format as in the low data rate frames. There is no M_PDU. The data follows directly after the insert zone.</p>



<p>Virtual channel 63 consists solely of idle data. This is a standard feature of the AOS Space Data Link protocol called OID channel (only idle data), which is always virtual channel 63. The data in the frames of this virtual channel is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and frame counter in the OID channel.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The frame loss computed from the jumps in the virtual channel frame counter shows that very few frames were lost. The large jumps near the end correspond to a gap in Paul’s data, which is divided into two files.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>Virtual channel 38 is quite interesting. I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1331711668045434886">joked on Twitter</a> that it resembles the Inception film, because it has several layers of CCSDS protocols. The timestamps in this virtual channel are quite weird, since comparing with the timestamps from the OID channel they seem to run too fast and extend into the future. There is no way that the 18396 frames in this virtual channel are able to span one hour and 30 minutes as shown here. I’m not sure what’s happening with this.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>This shows the first frames in virtual channel 38. We can discern the AOS headers, then two parts that seem quite similar, and then a large section of <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="173" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-768x206.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The data field of each of these AOS frames contains a single Space Packet, which is embedded directly without using M_PDU. The length of the Space Packet is 510 bytes including its header, which explains why the end of the AOS frame is filled with padding. These Space Packets belong to APID 92.</p>



<p>The contents of each of these Space Packets are two back to back AOS frames, which explains the repetition in the figure below. The AOS frames belong to spacecraft ID 197 (yet a new spacecraft!), virtual channel ID 52, and have the replay flag set.</p>



<p>The insert zone of these replayed AOS frames contains three unknown bytes followed by a 32 bit timestamp in the usual format. The timestamps and frame counts are shown below. The replay data is actually from the previous day, starting just 30 minutes after launch.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="631" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png 631w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px"></figure>



<p>These AOS frames have a CRC-16, in contrast with the usual AOS frames, which rely on the Reed-Solomon parity check bytes for error detection. The CRC of all the replay frames I’ve decoded is correct.</p>



<p>These replay AOS frames use M_PDU, and contain Space Packets from APIDs 301 and 2047 (the idle APID). As expected, the idle APID packets contain only zeros. The data in APID 301 is shown in the figure below. I am not sure how to interpret it, but some of the structure is evident.</p>

    <p>Oh boy, am I glad that I trusted my gut feeling.</p>

<p>You probably know the type of badge I’m talking about.  It’s tiny, lives in the lower-right corner of the screen and says something like “by Jakob Greenfeld”.</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/tinybadge.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But not too many indie makers seem to be using it. I hesitated myself. It makes the fact that the project is an indie project immediately obvious. Hence the project will be perceived as less professional. Also it possibly distracts customers and might annoy some of them.</p>

<p>So there are lots of reasons why you shouldn’t include a badge and not really many objective ones why you should.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I decided to include one on all of my pages. The main reason was that I instantly like a page more if it has such a badge (and not some annoying chat widget or whatever.) It shows me directly that I’m a looking at a project by a fellow indie maker. I really think of the badge as some kind of membership card for the indie maker club.</p>

<p>Okay, enough of this. You’re probably not here to hear about my sentimental feelings.</p>

<p>So let’s get back to the main story.</p>

<p>Now what happened is that yesterday I’m getting lots of new followers even though I didn’t write a single tweet. Also I’m getting lots of Gumroad notifications.</p>

<p><em>“You have a new subscriber for <a href="https://gumspy.com/">Gum Spy</a>”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”….</em></p>

<p>Cool, but strange. Something must be happening but I have no idea what.</p>

<p>Then I get a DM from <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevMcKendrick">Trevor McKendrick</a> (Chief of Staff @ Lambda School).</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/dm.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Apparently, Sam Parr and Shaan Puri talked about me on <a href="https://www.myfirstmillionpodcast.com/">their podcast</a>. The show has hundreds of thousands of listeners. I’m just a guy with 600 Twitter followers who launched his first paid product 4 weeks ago. This is insane.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/496MjbRwFPa52tqdJBvC3m?si=QrBc05p3TlOgEFDl9iqRNA">episode</a>, Shaan mentions that he discovered my stuff because of a tiny badge in the lower-right corner on the Gum Spy landing page.</p>

<p>Without the badge, my site would’ve been just another faceless project. But thanks to the badge, Shaan was quickly able to see that I’m a “build in public type of guy”, that I’m currently doing a <a href="http://jakobgreenfeld.com/mba">Bootstrap MBA learning experiment</a>,  that I recently launched similar projects. And this is why he decided to give me a shoutout on the show.</p>

<p>You probably thought the title of this post is clickbait. It’s not.</p>

<p>I really made dozens of sales (still counting) and got hundreds of new <a href="https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld">Twitter followers</a> and <a href="https://productideas.substack.com/">newsletter subscribers</a> only thanks to the tiny badge.</p>

<p>So what’s the takeaway? Use a “made by” badge on your sites, obviously.</p>

<p>And no worries, I’m not trying to sell you some “made by” badge service. The code for the badge I’m using is <a href="https://gist.github.com/levelsio/9c531122e557da6282458bbc2a8e2aff">freely available</a> (thanks <a href="https://levels.ui/">Pieter</a>!) and is so simple that really anyone can use it.</p>

	<b>Subject:</b> Referencing: <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2004/09/14.1">http://boston.conman.org/2004/09/14.1</a><br>

	</p>

	<p>Sean,</p>

	<p>My apologies if any of your time, sanity, peace, or data was lost
	due to the event. But surely I will clarify any of your doubts with
	some information about the attacks.</p>

	<p>It was a hired job. I was sent to take down the majority of <span>XXXXXXXXX</span>'s servers/content and actually
	infiltrated the <span>XXXXXXXXX</span> network
	<em>physically</em>.  I flew to <span>XXXXXXXXXX</span>,
	and social engineered my way onto client machines. From there I
	essentially attained enough credentials that left me able to access
	the companies client database(s), affiliation(s) database(s) … oh
	and logins to your servers.</p>

	<p> … However, your <code>swift.conman.org</code> (or Mark's
	rather) was running gentoo with some modifications including tighter
	suid access on vulnerable binaries on the system, and common
	misconfigurations through the system was also fixed.  Finally, using
	a kernel attack to sniff the memory of a recent “su” execution,
	root was caught.  As I looked around and tried to asses the
	situation, I suppose Mark witnessed (from another location perhaps)
	my SSH login attempts to servers he had access to.  In any case,
	<code>switch.conman.org</code> 
	was unnessesary but I'm glad Mark's paranoia took it down, because
	it would have left much more work for me to do on game day.  By the
	way, I still had access to <code>swift.conman.org</code> even after
	it was patched, I had all known system credentials plus there was a
	kernel entry using portknocking. so if the server was fixed up and
	left on, even during Mark's paranoia it still would have been a
	successful attack on my part.  So yes, the compromise of
	<code>swift.conman.org</code> and the other servers are related.  I
	was sloppy, and Mark is paranoid … I guess I lost that one.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I certainly wasn't expecting <em>this</em>.</p>

<p>There was more, including details about the company we're hosting the
sites for, even more details about the attack (but really, when it's an
inside job, it's all the more harder to prevent) and some details about
harding servers to prevent such an attack from happening (like a link to <a href="http://www.grsecurity.net/">grsecurity.net</a> which
I have to check out, but most of the other stuff is common sense).  But this
does answer a bunch of questions about the past few weeks of cracking
activity.</p>

<p>And how do I know for a fact that is guy is telling the truth?  He also
included the passwords to several accounts on <code>swift.conman.org</code>. 
To me, that's pretty conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>A new thing I've learned though—<a href="http://www.portknocking.org/">portknocking</a>, something else to look
into.</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>Anyway, I'm typing this as I sit across the street from a
	cybercafe so note not to waste your time backtracing.  This is my
	job, don't take it personal.</p>

	<p>sincerely and respectfully.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It's tough not to (especially since all this went down while three
hurricanes were headed our way) but I guess that's what I get for living in
a Gibsonian novel these days.</p>

<div>

	<h4>Update on Thursday, September 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2004</h4>

	<p>Just to clarify one last detail:  the cracker did 
	not social engineer his way into the colocation facility in <a href="http://fastcolo.net/" title="FastColo.net">Boca 
	Raton</a> or the <a href="http://www.napoftheamericas.com/">NAP 
	of the Americas</a> in Miami.  The physical access 
	mentioned was the corporate network of the company (which is not 
	located in South Florida) who's sites were hosted on the servers 
	in Boca and Miami.</p>

	<p>Just in case there might have been any confusion 
	on the matter.</p>

	<p>You have my permission to link freely to any entry here.  Go
	ahead, I won't bite.  I promise.</p>

	<p>The dates are the permanent links to that day's entries (or

	links to <em>that</em> entry only.  The format for the links are
	simple: Start with the base link for this site: <a class="page" href="http://boston.conman.org/">http://boston.conman.org/</a>, then add the date you are

	<p>You may also note subtle shading of the links and that's
	intentional: the “closer” the link is (relative to the

	using color shading to denote the distance a link is from here.  If
	you don't notice it, don't worry; it's not all <em>that</em>
	important.</p>

	<p>It is assumed that every brand name, slogan, corporate name,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Many years ago, Peter Norvig wrote a beautiful article <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">about creating a lisp interpreter in Python</a>. It’s the most fun tutorial I’ve seen, not just because it teaches you about my favorite language family (Lisp), but because it cuts through to the essence of interpreters, is fun to follow and quick to finish.</p><p>Recently, I had some time and wanted to learn Rust. It’s a beautiful systems language, and I’ve seen some great work come out from those who adopt it. I thought, <em>what better way to learn Rust, than to create a lisp interpreter in it?</em></p><p><strong>Hence, Risp — a lisp in rust — was born.</strong> In this essay you and I will follow along with <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">Norvig’s Lispy</a>, but instead of Python, we’ll do it in Rust 🙂.</p><p>If you haven’t heard of lisp, some Paul Graham’s essays (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html" target="_blank">one</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html" target="_blank">two</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">three</a>), alongside some <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a> will get you fired up. In short, everything is a list, everything is an expression, and that makes for a very powerful language.</p><p>Our structure will be similar to Norvig’s tutorial, though I depart slightly in two ways:</p><ol><li>Instead of 2 stopping points (Lispy Calculator and Full Lispy), we have 4 stopping points. This reflects the phases I took to build it in Rust.</li><li>Norvig’s syntax is based on Scheme. We will base it on Scheme too, but since I’m also a Clojure fan, I sometimes used slightly different naming, and different implementations for a few functions. I will note when I do that in the essay.</li></ol><p>Finally, this is the first program I wrote in Rust. I may have misused some things, so if you’re a Rust hacker, I’d love to hear your feedback 🙂.</p><p>With the notes out of the way, let’s get into it.</p><p>As Norvig suggests, our first goal is to create a subset of lisp, that can do what a basic calculator can do.</p><p>To make it as simple as possible to follow, for language 1, <strong>we’ll <em>only</em> support addition and subtraction.</strong> No variable definitions, no if statements, nada.</p><p>This departs a bit from Lispy, but I found this stopping point a lot more convenient when writing it in Rust. So, our goal:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>//=&gt; 17</span>
<span>(</span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>) </span><span>//=&gt; 3</span></code></pre><p>The important process we need to remember is the flow of an interpreter:</p><p><em>our program</em> ⟶ <em><strong>parse</strong></em> ⟶ <em>abstract syntax tree</em> ⟶ <em><strong>eval</strong></em> ⟶ <em>result</em></p><p>We will need to <strong>parse</strong> our program and convert it into an abstract syntax tree. After that, we can <strong>eval</strong> the abstract syntax tree and get our result. (Refer to Norvig’s article for more detailed definitions and explanations).</p><h2 id="type-definitions">Type Definitions</h2><p>Risp can have three kinds of values for now:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ find lib -name *.c | awk -F <span>'/'</span> <span>'{print $NF}'</span> | sort -u | tail
yp_maplist.c
yp_master.c
yp_match.c
yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c
zic.c</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be illustrated as a sequence of processes and pipes connecting the programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-chain.svg" alt="pipe chain"></p>

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)
look like this one, for
the kernmalloc (the kernel allocator documentation) example:</p>

<h2 id="the-c-interface-for-pipes">The C interface for pipes</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html">POSIX specification</a>
declares the <code>pipe</code> function with the following signature:</p>



<p>inside the <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header.</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-in-process.svg" alt="pipe in a process"></p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

<p>This algorithm is coded as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

{
	<span>char</span> c;

	<span>if</span> (child <span>==</span> <span>0</span>) {
		<span>/* child */</span>
		<span>if</span> (close(fildes[<span>1</span>]) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
			err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"close"</span>);
		read(fildes[<span>0</span>], <span>&amp;</span>c, <span>1</span>);
		printf(<span>"Received: %c</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, c);
		<span>/* force the buffer to be printed on the output (screen) */</span>
		fflush(stdout);
		_exit(<span>0</span>);
	}
	<span>/* parent */</span>
	<span>if</span> (close(fildes[<span>0</span>]) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)

	<span>if</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)

	<span>/* wait for the child process termination */</span>
	<span>if</span> (wait(<span>&amp;</span>status) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"wait"</span>);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	printf(<span>"_PC_PIPE_BUF: %ld</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, fpathconf(fildes[<span>1</span>],_PC_PIPE_BUF));
	printf(<span>"PIPE_BUF: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, PIPE_BUF);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</span><span>

</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (ioctl(fildes[<span>1</span>], FIONSPACE, <span>&amp;</span>n) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"ioctl"</span>);
	printf(<span>"FIONSPACE fildes[1]: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;signal.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (fcntl(fildes[<span>1</span>], F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"fcntl"</span>);

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* filter real errors from the unavailable for now resource */</span>
	<span>if</span> (errno <span>!=</span> EAGAIN)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

<p>We use software for our everyday needs because we want to get something done. We have goals to achieve and things to do.</p>
<p>The software we use is coded by brave programmers that have their own goals. Most of the time there is an overlap between their goals and ours.</p>
<p>Over time these will diverge.</p>
<p>This means that the tools we depend on grow features we don't use or understand. There will be bugs in these code parts which will prevent us from reaching our goals.</p>
<p>So we are at a fork in the road:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the choice of trying to understand the code and fix it.</li>
<li>We have the choice of trying another program, whose creator's goals are closer to ours.</li>
<li>We also have the choice of coding the software ourself.</li></ul>
<p>All but the last path mean endless seeking, evaluating and further deviation from our goals. Therefore we replace programs we do not understand fully with our own implementation.</p>
<p>The followers of the Code It Yourself Manifesto believe in these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We implement it according to our own goals.</li>
<li>We make mistakes and learn from them.</li>
<li>We learn how our tools we depend on need to work.</li>
<li>We gain a deep understanding of our problem domain.</li></ul>
<p>We still embrace sharing of ideas and code.</p>
<p>Sharing is only possible if we are excellent developers to each other. The next developer reading our code will be us in a not so distant future. Coding It Ourselves means we will document our code, clearly stating the goal of the software we write.</p>
<p>Together we enjoy the diversity of implementations and ideas.</p>
<p>We encourage our colleagues to</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27316166-the-effective-manager">The Effective Manager</a> says you only need 5 to 15 seconds to deliver effective feedback. Here are the 4 steps:</p>



<ol><li>Ask (“Can I give you some feedback?”)</li><li>State the behavior (“When you X…”)</li><li>State the impact (“…the result is Y.”)</li><li>Encourage effective future behavior (“Keep it up!” for positive feedback or “Can you change that?” for negative feedback)</li></ol>



<p>Those steps should be followed whether you’re giving positive or negative feedback. </p>



<p>Here’s an example, pasted from the book:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Manager</strong>: Can I give you some feedback?<br><strong>Direct</strong>: Sure, boss.<br><strong>Manager</strong>: When you tell my boss bad news before me, even with the best of intentions, I end up getting in a lot of trouble for not knowing before he did. Can you try to tell me first, going forward?</p></blockquote>



<p>Boom, done in seconds. (And if you’re thinking “but it’ll take much longer when you account for the inevitable debate about what actually happened!” then there’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/27/future-focused-feedback/">an answer for that too</a>.)</p>



<p>The beautiful thing about this rapid feedback is the frequency that it allows. When it only takes a few seconds, why not give feedback every day? Why not 5 times a day? It lowers the threshold of what is worthy of feedback.</p>



<p>One caveat: the book has a 3 question test you have to ask yourself before you can deliver the feedback:</p>



<ol><li>Are you angry? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you focused on the past instead of the future (i.e., reminding them about something they did wrong or punishing them)? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you able to let it go? If not, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>. In other words, if you can’t let it go in terms of how you feel, you <em>should</em> let it go by not giving negative feedback. If you feel an urge to deliver feedback, you’re probably doing it for the wrong reasons.</li></ol>



<blockquote><p>If you’re not angry, if it’s not about the past or about punishment, and if you can let it go, then go ahead and give the feedback.</p></blockquote>



<p>There you have it. 5 second feedback. Lower the threshold for what’s feedback-worthy and delivery a steady stream of rapid feedback every day.</p>

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

An operator would wait for the flash of an enemy gun to start the film rolling and the equipment would record the signals as they arrived progressively based on their proximity to the impulse source. </span></p><p><span>The film took around five minutes to develop after which trained analysts could decode the patterns on the film and use them to work out the positions of enemy guns using a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_sound_ranging#cite_note-LawCosines-2">multilateration</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>By the end of WW1 sound ranging techniques could locate enemy guns within 25m to 50m under normal atmospheric conditions and even determine the <a href="https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/OrderOfBattle/Thesis/index.html">caliber, number of guns and the target</a></span><span>. &nbsp;The document above gives us a great insight into how intense and chaotic the barrage of gunfire must have been to those fighting. The missing section that has been edited out of the film in the middle of the image also begs the question â€œwhat would those 2 minutes have sounded like?â€�</span></p><p><b>Forensic sound</b></p><p><span>Using this document, the team at IWM were keen for us to try and create an interpretation of how this â€˜missingâ€™ moment might have sounded as the introduction to a series of exhibitions they were working on to commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War.</span></p><p><span>In order to go about creating a reconstruction, we had do a bit of â€˜forensicâ€™ work, corroborating historical information about the type of artillery that would have been in use by the US, German and French armies at this point in the war, with what the visual information from the sound ranging film tells us about the size, distance and frequency of blasts and finally, interpreting the kind of reverberation you would have expected to hear by looking at landscape photographs and archive film footage from the front.</span></p><p><span>As its basis, our reconstruction uses contemporary recordings of the Howitzer, Mauser, Stokes, Vickers and Lee Enfield guns made for the purposes of sound design in film and television</span><span>. These recordings were then grouped and triggered according to who was using them and in patterns that corresponded to archive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2lGzfuJaok">newsreel</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMf5MmicGlQ">footage</a> taken at the front</span><span>. The density of the gunfire was interpreted both from the sound ranging document and further archive footage. All of these elements were mixed together relative to each other and with respect to the distances over which the fighting was taking place. Finally, a convolution reverb</span><span> with an impulse response recorded in a relative â€˜free fieldâ€™ scenario was used to simulate the space and dispersion of the sound across the front</span>.</p><p><strong>Feeling sound: bone conduction</strong></p><p><span>The team at IWM were very keen to present this unique document and our reconstruction in a way that would not only bring them to life, but also make explicit the relationship between them for visitors. With this in mind, we drew inspiration from the mechanics of the â€˜sound rangingâ€™ equipment itself.</span></p><figure id="attachment_1477" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_1477"><picture><source srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg.webp 800w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-300x225.jpg.webp 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-450x338.jpg.webp 450w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-225x169.jpg.webp 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px" type="image/webp"><img src="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="335" srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg 800w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-300x225.jpg 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-768x576.jpg 768w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-450x338.jpg 450w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-225x169.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px"></picture><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_1477">A French ‘sound ranging’ system from 1920s</figcaption></figure><p><span>The â€˜sound rangingâ€™ equipment that was deployed at the end of &nbsp;WW1 used an innovative Low Frequency Microphone developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sansome_Tucker">William Sansome Tucker</a></span><span> in 1916. &nbsp;This microphone used a Helmholtz resonator to detect the physical vibrations of low frequencies of the guns in order to record them onto film</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>The physicality of â€˜sound rangingâ€™ and the fact that the explosions of the guns firing would have been felt as shock waves by soldiers at the same time as being heard led us to the idea of trying to incorporate bone conduction into the exhibit, as a way of tying together our reconstruction with the physicality of â€˜sound rangingâ€™.</span></p><p><strong>How does bone conduction work?</strong></p><p>Normally sound waves reach our ears as vibrations travelling through the air to our eardrums, and then on to the Cochlea or inner ear, which is connected to the auditory nerve that transmits the sounds to our brain.</p><p>However, the ear is a very sensitive organ and it can also pick up vibrations through our skulls. The most obvious example of this is when you go to the dentist and have your teeth cleaned. Dentists often use electric polishers, these polishers make a sound that can be heard in the room, but also, when applied to your teeth and transmitted through your skull, heard directly through the process of ‘bone conduction’.</p><figure id="attachment_1481" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_1481"><picture><source srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg.webp 442w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-300x205.jpg.webp 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-225x154.jpg.webp 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px" type="image/webp"><img src="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="302" srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg 442w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-300x205.jpg 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-225x154.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px"></picture><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_1481">Laurie Anderson, Handphone Table, 1978.</figcaption></figure><p>The logic of ‘bone conduction’ is that anything that vibrates can be put directly on your head and heard through your skull. It is also possible to ‘bridge’ a gap between something vibrating and your skull with an intermediary solid object.</p><p>As luck would have it, Laurie Anderson, in her piece ‘<a

<p>Yesterday I saw this tweet of Chris Campbell passing by in my timeline:</p>



<p>Aah, the memories. Quake III Arena, one of my favourite first-person shooter games.</p>

<p>Years ago, I spent (and lost) so much time playing this fast-paced game with friends and foes, and now it is brought into the world of containers and Kubernetes with <strong><a href="https://github.com/criticalstack/quake-kube" target="_blank">QuakeKube</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalOneTech" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>QuakeKube is a Kubernetes-ified version of</em> <a href="https://github.com/inolen/quakejs" target="_blank"><em>QuakeJS</em></a> <em>that runs a dedicated</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena" target="_blank"><em>Quake 3</em></a> <em>server in a Kubernetes Deployment, and then allow clients to connect via QuakeJS in the browser.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t wait to give it a try, especially after reading the documentation, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Container images are being cross-compiled with</em> <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/" target="_blank"><em>Docker Buildx</em></a> <em>so it can run on hardware with different architectures and operating systems. Currently, it is building for <code>linux/amd64</code> and <code>linux/arm64</code>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>ARM64 support!</strong> Great, it means I can run it on one of my Raspberry Pis!</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-fragging">Let’s get fragging!</h2>

<p>Most of the work is already done by others, so with the proper tools and projects, it will take you only a few minutes to get everything up and running.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
<li>a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 20.04, which supports arm64<br></li>
<li><code>k3sup</code>, a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM.<br></li>
<li><code>arkade</code>, a simple Golang CLI with strongly-typed flags to install charts and apps to your cluster in one command.<br></li>
<li><code>kubectl</code><br></li>
<li>a DigitalOcean account and an API Token</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>First, install <code>k3s</code> on your Raspberry Pi running a arm64 OS like Ubuntu 20.04</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ k3sup install --ip <span>192</span>.168.0.52 --user ubuntu --k3s-extra-args <span>'--no-deploy servicelb --no-deploy traefik'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After the installation of k3s on the Raspberry Pi, k3sup also downloads the required kubeconfig file in your current working directory.<br>
Make sure to configure <code>kubectl</code> to use this config file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ export KUBECONFIG<span>=</span><span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span>/kubeconfig</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, install the inlets-operator with <code>arkade</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ arkade install inlets-operator --provider digitalocean --token-file ~/do-api-token</code></pre></div>
<p>The inlets-operator will create an inlets exit-node on DigitalOcean, giving the LoadBalancer services in the private k3s cluster a public IP address.</p>

<p>As clients connect to the server via QuakeJS in the browser with websockets, the OSS version of inlets will do just fine. If you want to have better support for TLS etc, I can highly recommend having a look at inlets PRO version.</p>

<p>Finally, take the example yaml file from the QuakeKube GitHub repository and make the appropriate changes. The service should be updated to a LoadBalancer instead of type NodePort, and of course you can change the configuration to tweak the game preferences to your own needs.</p>

<p>Example of a QuakeKube yaml file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

  name: quakejs
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>Traditional filesystems and databases have very different properties. Traditional filesystems are best suited for storing large objects while databases for structured data.

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>As we are talking about an image <i>file</i>, it comes natural to store it on the traditional <b>filesystem</b>. Unfortunately, traditional filesystems don't support transactions. Getting the security aspects right is hard. It's a challenge to make consistent backups given that you can't just stop the world. Inevitably, a traditional filesystem will be modified while you are working on the backup. Sooner or later this will cause problems.</p><p><b>Databases</b> can solve all of the above. They have transactions. If you do a backup, it will likely be consistent by default. The problem is, databases are bad with large objects. They are a bad choice if you want to serve lots of users.</p><p>This is really frustrating. Why can't we have a storage system that combines the best of both worlds?</p><p>I want this:</p></div>

<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-7"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>The problem space is cut along the wrong dimensions</h2><p>Let's take a step back and look at the big picture. This is how the problem space for storing data is currently divided:</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>The problem space should be divided along <i>conflicting requirements</i>.</p><p>For <b>example</b>, storing ice cream and fruits have conflicting requirements. Ice cream has to be frozen while freezing directly harms fruits. Ice cream requires below zero temperatures while fruits require above zero temperatures. That's a hard conflict. <i>They require different storage solutions.</i></p><p>The thing is, traditional filesystem and database features have no conflicts. Or tell me a single feature that requires:</p><ul><li><p>the <i>lack of </i><b>hierarchy</b> support,</p></li><li><p>the <i>lack of </i><b>large object</b> support,</p></li><li><p>the<i> lack of</i> <b>transaction</b> support, or</p></li><li><p>the<i> lack of</i> <b>structured data</b> support.</p></li></ul><p>There is none.

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h3>Controlled changes</h3><p>Some data of the website must be controlled, that is, only changed by the website's owners. This includes the codebase, the page structure, blog post contents, some assets like images and videos or even highly structured data like product features. Such data shall not be changing in the production environment<a href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a> as that would mean your visitors see work-in-progress changes that may even break the website temporarily.</p><p>Controlled data shall be edited in <b>development environments</b> which shall be clone-able from the production environment. It often requires <b>version control</b> and <b>non-linear development</b> (branching and merging). Upon shipping a new version of the codebase to the production environment, the new state should<i> replace</i> the old state.</p><h3>Uncontrolled changes</h3><p>On the other hand, there are changes that simply <i>can not be controlled</i>. This includes user contributions like comments and webshop orders. It includes changes made by automatically executed scripts, for example one that resets counters at midnight. It shall include logs generated while serving requests.</p><p>Uncontrolled data consists of <b>linear, sequential changes</b> thus it requires linear snapshots not non-linear feature branches. When cloning the production environment for development purposes, uncontrolled data will typically need to be cloned as well thereby giving you complete freedom to try anything without a complex setup process. This also helps reproducing bugs in minimal time. Upon shipping a new version of the codebase to the production environment, the new state of uncontrolled data shall be typically <i>dropped</i> to prevent accidentally overwriting changes made in production.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>The Boomla Filesystem</h2><p>Most websites and web apps need both a controlled and an uncontrolled storage area.

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h3>Eliminating global data</h3><p>We have addressed how to have a hierarchy of objects everywhere, even on the dynamic filesystem but if we store it as a separate filesystem tree, we are back to square one: a global shared namespace. Instead, what we need is the ability to <i>attach</i> dynamic volumes anywhere on the static filesystem, like so:</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png"><p><img src="https://cdn.boomla.net/v2.0/boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png?height=1024&amp;o1-cache=cb5a4070bc6&amp;width=1024" alt="Dynamic volumes attached to the Static Filesystem"></p></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-21"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>The <i>existence</i> of these dynamic volumes must be version controlled but their contents must not be as they are constantly changing. They must be somehow stored on the dynamic filesystem instead.</p><p>Let's see an <b>example</b>. Imagine a comments element embedded into a page. It shall have its own dynamic volume with its own schema. The existence of the comments element must be version controlled but not the actual comments. They can't be: they would cause continuous merging issues.</p><p>Removing either the comments element itself (or even the page it is embedded in) must remove the comments element itself with all associated user comments. In the traditional setup, you would have to write lots of code yourself to figure out what data needs to be removed. This takes time (money) and may be non-trivial when there are several 3rd party plugins installed. With proper encapsulation, the system can automatically do this for you.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><div><p>So here is how this works. Boomla files have a <i>link</i> property. You can attach a dynamic volume anywhere on your website's filesystem by simply setting the file's link property to <code>dynamic</code>.</p></div></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/the-underlying-structure-of-embedded-dynamic-volumes.png"><p><img src="https://cdn.boomla.net/v2.0/boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/the-underlying-structure-of-embedded-dynamic-volumes.png?height=1024&amp;o1-cache=2c2c8bfd096&amp;width=1024" alt="The underlying structure of embedded dynamic volumes"></p></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-25"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>By doing so, the system will create a new volume on the hidden dynamic filesystem and map it to the linking file. (Using the linking file's file ID.) From that point on, you will be able to write the dynamic subtree as usual. It will appear as if it was part of your website's filesystem tree.</p><p>That way, in Boomla, deleting the page holding the comments will <i>also remove the actual comments</i>.</p><p>The root volume of the dynamic filesystem is hidden by design, it's not directly accessible. If you are interested, see the <a href="https://boomla.com/docs/how-it-works/anatomy-of-the-boomla-filesystem/file-link/dynamic-link">dynamic link docs</a> for more details.</p></div>

<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-19"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Undo, redo</h2><p>One of the really powerful features of the Boomla Filesystem is that undo/redo is available for the entire website. It <i>makes</i> us experiment. We can try things, we can fail and we can always undo. It's a huge boost to <i>dare to try</i>.</p><p>The great news is, <b>undo/redo will still be available</b> when collaboration is enabled.</p><p>There is a little caveat though. In the <b>production environment</b> you may have multiple users making changes. You definitely don't want to accidentally undo a comment or an order made by someone else. Plus in production, the static filesystem is read-only as you probably don't want your visitors to see your work-in-progress. Because of this, undo/redo is not available in the production environment (master branch).</p><p>Once you clone the production environment and thus create a <b>development branch</b>, undo/redo will be available for your entire website. Changes made to the static and dynamic filesystems are bundled in a single atomic transaction, creating a single undo point. That way, whatever changes you make, you will be able to use undo/redo.</p><p>To rephrase, you either don't have undo/redo at all (master branch) or you have undo/redo for your entire website (secondary branches).</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-8"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Users, Access Control, Security</h2><p>Using a traditional filesystem and database poses another problem with access control.</p><p><b>Access control can only be enforced in a layer that has access to both users and data.</b> It's just impossible otherwise. Websites and web apps introduce their own user concepts. As a result, they should take over all access control responsibilities. Data access should only happen through a single, well defined layer.</p><p>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Both databases and the underlying OS have their own user concepts with their own means of doing access control. Plus your chosen CMS or framework has its own user concept and access control mechanisms. Application developers have access to all of them. They have to call all the right functions themselves to make sure everything is secure.

	<div>
		
<p>There’s a fantastic article from last year titled <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">Parse, don’t validate</a>. I’d highly recommend it to any programmer (along with the more recent follow up <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/">Names are not type safety</a>). The basic idea is that there are two ways to check that some input to a function is valid:</p>



<ul><li>A <em>validator</em> checks that the input is valid and throws an error if not. It doesn’t return anything. For example, checking that a list is not empty. </li><li>A <em>parser</em> does the same as a validator, but returns a more specific representation of the input that ensures that the required property is satisfied. For example, checking that a list is not empty and <em>returning a NonEmptyList type</em>. </li></ul>



<p>The thesis of the article is that parsers are preferable to validators. If you’ve not read the original article, please do so – it’s very well written and makes the case much better than I can summarise it. The essential message is to <em>make illegal states unrepresentable</em>. In the article, this is done by making use of the type system. This is a philosophy I entirely agree with, but I want to point out and expand upon one ironic aspect of the argument:</p>



<p><strong><em>A type checker is a paradigmatic example of a validator!</em></strong></p>



<p>A type checker, after all, takes as input an already parsed program representation and rejects it if it fails to type-check. It doesn’t return a more specific representation of the program. (Not to be confused with <em>type inference</em>, which does return more information, but only about the types). </p>



<p>So what would be the parser alternative to a type checker in a programming language? One approach would be to actually create a more specific grammar that eliminates illegal states. For example, if a given function requires a number that must be between one and five, then rather than having a generic syntax for function calls such as:</p>



<pre>fun_call ::= fun_name ‘(‘ integer ‘)’</pre>



<p>You would instead define specific grammar rules for the functions you provide:</p>



<pre>one_to_five ::= 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5<br>fun_call ::= ‘lil_fac(‘ one_to_five ‘)’<br>         | ... other function definitions ...</pre>



<p>Creating such specific grammars is one approach to crafting <em><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">domain-specific languages</a> </em>(DSLs). And indeed, DSLs are a great way of ensuring that illegal states aren’t representable. Of course, this is not a scalable solution if you want to make a general-purpose language with user-defined functions.</p>



<p>An alternative to having a very specific grammar is to instead <em>raise the level of abstraction</em>, so that it is easier to avoid invalid states. For example, a common source of programming errors is out of bounds indexing into arrays. This occurs because the programming language only offers a primitive indexing operation: <code>a[x]</code>. Here “x” is an integer but might be out of bounds, resulting in an exception or crash (if you’re lucky). One way we could prevent this would be to define a more specific type of “integers between zero and 12” so that the type system rejects any potentially invalid indexing operations, and then track this more precise type for each array — validation again. </p>



<p>A different approach would be to notice that there are typically a few common ways that you want to use an array and provide specific abstractions in the language that capture those uses. For example, it’s very common to want to iterate through the array performing some kind of calculation. Rather than making everyone manually write out the for-loops for doing this — do arrays in this language start at 0 or 1? Do they stop at array.length or array.length – 1? Do array indexes have a specific type? — you could instead offer a general <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">fold </a>(reduce) operation. Likewise, instead of making people write their own hashtables you could provide one built-in to the language itself. By providing better abstractions you make it less likely that programmers will hit illegal states. </p>



<p>You can then go further and <em>remove</em> the more primitive operations, only allowing access to the higher level abstractions. Hopefully in 2020 most programmers would agree that removing goto statements in favour of higher level structured programming abstractions was a win, and the same can be true of other low-level constructs: nulls, raw memory pointers, etc. </p>



<p>In the world of computer security, there is a direct analogue of this discussion. The security model of most computer systems allows a separation between operations I <em>can</em> (try to) perform and operations I am <em>allowed</em> to perform: I can try and delete your website, but (hopefully) the request will be rejected as unauthorized. In contrast, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">object-capability systems</a> my ability to even invoke such an operation depends upon me holding an unforgeable c<em>apability </em>granting me permission to perform it. It’s not possible to even attempt an operation that I am not allowed to perform. For example, in a REST API using <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2019/01/16/can-you-ever-safely-include-credentials-in-a-url/">capability URIs</a>, I cannot simply send a DELETE request to /users/alice, but instead need to send it to some unguessable random URI – if I don’t already have that URI then I can’t even begin to send the request. Object-capability security therefore aims to make <em>unauthorized states unrepresentable</em>. </p>



<p>Perhaps the most widely known embodiment of the object-capability paradigm is the <a href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</a>: a <em>dynamically-typed</em> object-oriented programming language. Although now somewhat abandoned, it is a fascinating language with a lot of great ideas. E uses strong abstraction boundaries to ensure security. Be warned: the E website is a rabbit hole of incredible depth!</p>



<p>In my twenties, I used to do a lot of programming in <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/">Tcl</a>. A language that most would agree is about as far removed from a modern statically typed programming language as you can get. (Often pointed out with something close to utter disgust). And yet the idea of making illegal states unrepresentable was entirely natural to myself and other Tcl programmers. I would frequently start a programming project by creating a <a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/interp.htm#M12">blank-slate interpreter</a>, stripping out all the built-in language constructs (<a href="http://nsl.com/">loops</a>, procedures, even <a href="https://tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/expr.htm">arithmetic</a>), and then adding back in a carefully selected set of high-level domain-specific primitives. This DSL would then become the application’s configuration file, safe in the knowledge that illegal configurations cannot be expressed. </p>



<p>To summarise, my point is not that type systems are bad or that the original essay is flawed. On the contrary, I thank the flying spaghetti monster almost every day for the type system in my day job (and that is only Java’s tepid concoction), and I think the “parse, don’t validate” essay is excellent. But the last two decades have seen such advances in type systems and the adoption of typeful programming patterns that we are in danger of thinking that type systems are the only way of achieving correctness in software construction. They are a tremendously powerful tool, but more basic techniques of abstraction and information hiding can be just as powerful. The goal of making illegal states unrepresentable should be one of the defining goals of software engineering, but there are many valid ways to crack that nut.</p>



<p><em>Shameless plug: I discuss capability URIs in depth in chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">my book on API security</a>, just published by Manning. I also discuss using types to enforce security properties in chapter 6. </em></p>

<p>Who’s got two thumbs and shipped her first of <a href="https://monicalent.com/12x-startup/">12 startups in 12 months</a> <em>on schedule</em>? That’s right, this girl.</p>

<p>In its first week, the <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 reached $5K in revenue through
a combination of lifetime deals, subscriptions, and my first ever Bitcoin transaction (thanks, Nico!).</p>

<p>A profitable first week isn’t what makes this a success in my book.</p>

<p>I’m <em>thrilled</em> at all the cool members who decided to join.
Exactly as I’d hoped, each person adds something unique and interesting to the community,
and I’m really excited to see where it goes.</p>

<p>So, welcome to my first monthly retrospective.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll be sharing a behind-the-scenes look at the first week of my paid community launch
and reveal what I’m shipping in November.</p>

<p>Below you’ll discover charts, graphs, screenshots, strategy, reflections, and my master plan
for growing Blogging for Devs through viral, generated content 🔮</p>

<p>I promise, it’s good.</p>



<p>First question: Did I really?</p>

<p>Before talking about what I’ve been up to in October, it’s important to
get on the same page about this:</p>

<p><strong>Even though I began charging to join the community this month, the community
itself was launched as a sort of “closed beta” back in July.</strong></p>

<p>The newsletter that helped me connect with first 100 free members (and most of the
paid members — more on that later) was launched in May.</p>

<p>You know what they say about overnight success.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s what and how I launched in a month.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-community-preview-image.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Pro Community"></p>

<p><a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 is a paid
community for developers, makers, engineering managers, and technical founders to grow their blogs
through feedback, collaboration, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>We have accountability groups, virtual events and workshops, members-only resources and original content,
and most importantly — super kind and knowledgeable members.</p>

<p>For the first 250 people to join, it costs $12/month, $96/year, or $180 once.</p>

<p>The discussions are powered by <a href="http://circle.so/" alt="Circle (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Circle</a>
 and rocking
a custom theme I hacked together through highly specific CSS selectors and
vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/circle-code-snippets.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they say you only need to know React these days 😝</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It integrates with the Gatsby website through a custom OAuth provider, which uses Firebase
for authentication. It’s all serverless and cloud native and such.</p>

<p>In October, I built Events, a member RSS feed, signup, payment, the landing page, onboarding, profiles, welcome email sequence,
and a lean batch of starter content. I designed everything myself in Figma. For more granular detail on building the product,
you can see the day-to-day in my <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1315678202988244993" target="_blank">twitter thread</a>.</p>

<p>Enough about tech, let’s talk launch.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-pro-screenshot-2.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community"></p>

<h2 id="success-metrics-why-you-won-t-find-an-overall-conversion-rate-in-this-report">Success metrics: Why you won’t find an overall conversion rate in this report</h2>

<p>My real goal for the community was to get
great people in, and not to overly optimize for converting anyone with a pulse.</p>

<p>That’s why my biggest launch fear wasn’t that no one would sign up.</p>

<p>It was that people I <em>don’t like</em> would sign up. Spammers, self-promoters, attention-seekers,
jerks.
Thankfully it hasn’t been the case and everyone is awesome so far 🤞</p>

<p>I try to scare those types away with a prominent Code of Conduct and an “Is this right for you?” checklist.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-checklist.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<p>That’s why I have no idea what my “conversion rate” for the community is and I don’t actually care.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> pay attention to the opt-in rate for my free newsletter, though, so don’t take this as, “Girl doesn’t care about metrics.”</p>

<p>I care about metrics, just <em>not</em> on the community landing page.</p>

<p>The reason is, joining a community is a long-term thing.
Something like this often takes time and multiple exposures for people
to make the decision — it was the same for me and <a href="https://rosie.land/" alt="Rosieland (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Rosieland</a>
 and <a href="http://trends.co/" target="_blank">Trends</a>.</p>

<p>The more interesting question is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I can I learn about the members who did sign up, so I can find more people like them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that, it’s chart time 👯‍♀️</p>



<p>Were paying members wooed by my slick landing page, or convinced by
a carefully crafted tweet?</p>

<p>Turns out, probably not.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-members.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Member Attribution"></p>

<p>Most new members were already subscribed to <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/" target="_blank">my free weekly newsletter</a> about blogging for developers, which is about 4,000 subscribers strong.</p>

<p>Every Friday for nearly six months, I’ve been sending out original content about
blogging, SEO, going viral, attracting an audience, and a splash of motivational moments. It takes me an entire day to write.</p>

<p>Out of 69 new paying members in the first week, <strong>only three were
unattributable</strong> at least one of three sources:</p>

<ol>
<li>Waitlister</li>
<li>Newsletter Subscriber</li>
<li>Twitter Follower</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-channels.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Paid Community Launch Channels"></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Newsletter backstory:</strong> I started the newsletter in May, and it’s since grown to over 4,000 subscribers. If you want to know how, check out the writeups I’ve done <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/launch-a-newsletter/" alt="here (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">here</a>
 and <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/product-hunt-launch/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people had multiple touchpoints: subscriber <em>and</em> on the waitlist, or followed me on twitter
<em>and</em> subscriber to the newsletter.</p>

<p>However, only <strong>31% of new members follow me on Twitter</strong>. I’m not offended, to the contrary —
I prefer it.</p>

<p>Now I know that if I want to grow the community, the best thing I can do
is have more of the right people <strong>join the newsletter first</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s why my goal is to grow the newsletter, and trust that the community
will eventually benefit from the best subscribers joining up.</p>

<p>Let’s take a dip into revenue for a second.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-and-where-did-revenue-come-from">How much and where did revenue come from?</h2>

<p>As I said in the <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1325008065041666049" alt="tweet (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">tweet</a>
 where I collected ideas for this article, the $5K revenue is <em>not</em> MRR (monthly recurring revenue).</p>

<p>MRR for the Blogging for Devs Community is just $516 according to Stripe.</p>

<p>So where did the first week’s $5K in revenue come from?</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-revenue.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Revenue"></p>

<p>Someone on Twitter recently asked me if I have any “thought leadership”
to spare on the topic of <strong>lifetime pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t.</p>

<p>Guess what, I’m neither optimizing for conversion nor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value" alt="LTV (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">LTV</a>
 🙃</p>

<p>Offering a lifetime price at a lower cost than 2 years as a member is
really just a way for me to say “Thank you” to people who are in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>I see it as a mutual commitment.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-sustainable-yet">Is this sustainable yet?</h2>

<p>You might see $5K in a week and think it sounds like a lot of money. If only one
could extrapolate that to $20k/mo, then I’d be set.</p>

<p>But of course, it’s not the whole picture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Taxes and healthcare are super expensive here in Germany</li>
<li>I already spend over $300/mo on SaaS tools to run the community</li>
<li>Only $500 currently recurs monthly, assuming zero growth/churn</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, I have a <strong><em>very</em> long way to go</strong> before the community is sustainable.</p>

<p>That’s why my November startup is a side project to scale reach of the newsletter,
which should <em>in turn</em> drive the growth of the community.</p>

<p>I think marketers would call this a “funnel”.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-funnel.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Funnel"></p>

<p>I think about it a little more like concentric circles approaching a core.</p>

<p>My next task is to expand the outermost ring with the kind of people who are
likely to join and enjoy the newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="my-master-plan-for-growing-blogging-for-devs-beyond-twitter-and-word-of-mouth">My master plan for growing Blogging for Devs beyond Twitter and word of mouth</h2>

<p>Channels die. Or at least, they become exhausted.</p>

<p>Although people still write me emails saying they’ve been following for
years, and just found out I have a newsletter — most of that is probably in the past.</p>

<p>People who know me, know about Blogging for Devs.</p>

<p>I really don’t want to spend all day on Twitter “growing my social media presence”.
I’d rather be building cool shit and helping other people build cool shit, too.
Let people find me through that.</p>

<p>Right now, word of mouth is what grows the newsletter.</p>

<p>Random mentions and links.  I find out through welcome emails or through
stalking my backlink reports from time to time.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/newsletter-replies.png" alt="Lala"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do reply to everyone who emails me, but I was running a bit behind
after spending the prior week following the US election 🙈</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On average, I gain about 5-10 subscribers per day.</p>

<p>A prominent mention on Twitter, Indie Hackers, or the success of a subscriber’s
blog post can push than number over 100.</p>

<p><strong>The problem? Today, word of mouth isn’t sufficient to grow the newsletter quickly enough to reach sustainability in the near term.</strong></p>

<p>Ironically, I’m also a blogger with no spare time to grow it writing a ton of individual blog posts 😅</p>

<p>So how can I grow my newsletter about blogging, without blogging <em>myself</em>,
and without relying on Twitter for all my traffic?</p>

<p>Here comes the master plan. I hope it works.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-ll-build-traffic-to-blogging-for-devs-while-writing-virtually-no-blog-posts">How I’ll build traffic to Blogging for Devs (while writing virtually no blog posts)</h2>

<p>I have a theory. Well, I have a few theories.</p>

<p>The first one is this: Developers want to discover blogs written by other developers.
Reading company engineering blogs is fine, but quality content from their peers or individuals
they admire is far more interesting.</p>

<p>Most places to discover developer content feature individual articles. Hacker
News, Reddit, and Twitter all fundamentally work this way.</p>

<p>But what’s more interesting is the person behind the blog. Their personality, what makes them unique,
inspiring, and worth following in their own right.</p>

<p>To back this up, I present Exhibit A.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Tech Twitter:</p><p>What is your NUMBER ONE favorite blog by someone in tech, who has a <em>distinct writing style</em>? Where you read their articles for their <em>unique personality or voice</em>?</p><p>(Pls no list of twitter handles, direct link to the blog is 👍)</p></div>— Monica Lent (@monicalent) <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1299054522074005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>Apart from the fact that asking for any kind of recommendation on Twitter is a
one-way ticket to pandemonium, you can tell from the replies that
people feel strongly about the topic. 400+ responses.</p>

<p>When I build something, I like that the topic evokes a response like this.</p>

<p><strong>It means people care.</strong></p>

<p>Extension of the theory (this time with less evidence): Many people who read
amazing tech blogs also aspire to create one themselves.</p>

<p>Ergo, if I create a place for people to discover the best developer blogs,
there’s a good chance people who show up will like my newsletter, too.</p>

<p>So here’s my plan.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/bfd-rankings-social-preview.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Trends"></p>

		<p>Back last winter – in the beforetimes, as they say now – I did a lot of thinking about how I could be most politically impactful in this election cycle. What I landed on was fundraising focused on my state legislature here in North Carolina. <a href="http://blairreeves.me/2020/08/31/thoughts-on-fundraising/">I wrote a blog about it</a> – one of the few I’ve gotten around to writing this year – and promised a follow-up on what I learned about the nuts-and-bolts of indie political fundraising. So here is that follow-up.</p>

<p>When I launched the <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">Long Leaf Pine Slate</a> in January of 2020, I figured I might be able to raise a few thousand dollars from family and friends. Not much, but something. We wound up doing a lot more than that. “The Slate” caught fire, and over the course of the year, became <i>the largest independent channel of funding based in the state</i> to Democrats running for the North Carolina state legislature. We raised more than $300,000 from over a thousand donors for a small group of our most strategic Democratic candidates running against vulnerable Republican incumbents.</p>
<p>That may not sound like much if you’re used to reading about Senate races which raise tens of millions. But at the state legislative scale, that’s actually very big money. Here’s some comparison to give you a sense of scale:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic.png.pagespeed.ce.kwwoCB2JuC.png" alt="" width="960" height="540" srcset="http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic.png.pagespeed.ce.kwwoCB2JuC.png 960w, http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xQ3-PAC-graphic-300x169.png.pagespeed.ic.5vOtQdpn_j.png 300w, http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xQ3-PAC-graphic-768x432.png.pagespeed.ic.GDK3GM5_As.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p>If the Long Leaf Pine Slate were a PAC, we’d have been the third-largest in the state and the single largest donor to Democrats based in North Carolina. Better: all of that money went to just a small group of our most important races. We raised almost as much money for those select Democrats as Duke Energy – basically the evil empire of right-wing power in North Carolina – gave to Republicans. (Directly, anyway. More on that later.)</p>
<p>The Long Leaf Pine Slate was nothing but <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">a website</a> that linked to an ActBlue fundraising page featuring our candidates and <a href="https://twitter.com/forwardcarolina">a Twitter account</a>. When donors gave, every dollar thus went directly to our candidates’ campaigns, nowhere else. The Slate was not, itself, a PAC – meaning we didn’t touch any money. You could not, for example, write a check to the Long Leaf Pine Slate. We didn’t even have a bank account. It was a 100% volunteer project.</p>
<p>Something similar to this – a no-nonsense ActBlue fundraising slate for state legislative candidates – should exist in every state. If you’re reading this, maybe you should start one, or join up with others who are. The purpose of this blog is to offer up some lessons learned, and maybe – just maybe – convince you, dear reader, that you can do this too.</p>
<h2>Why this model works</h2>
<p>An ActBlue fundraising page literally takes every dollar that is contributed and just slices it up among the campaign recipients you list. If there are ten campaigns listed, then each gets 10 cents. It’s that simple. What you see is what you get.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned PACs and parties act as intermediaries between a donor and the campaigns that need their money, and this causes lots of problems. Unfortunately, both (but particularly PACs) tend to be incredibly inefficient ways for donors to help the good guys, and wind up spending lots of money on things other than getting candidates elected. Very, very few people who give to PACs or parties ever actually look at the disclosures to see where their money went. Without naming names, I have been personally disappointed when I actually saw the spending disclosures from progressive PACs that I thought were good, but turned out to be big money-furnaces for politicos to get paid. (Caveat: yes, there are some good PACs too. They’re just rarer than you’d think.)</p>
<p>Besides its transparency, another large advantage of the ActBlue model is it allows organizations to raise substantially more money per candidate. If we’d been a PAC, we would’ve been limited to giving $5,400 per endorsed candidate – the legal maximum in North Carolina. But in the ActBlue model, <i>we’re</i> not the donor – in a way, we’re just pointing the actual donors to a list of candidates and saying, “these are the folks to give to.” So when you get lots and lots of folks giving money through that page, and each one can give up to the legal limit, it really adds up. ActBlue allows you to see just how much folks have given through your page, which is how we know the Slate raised so much money, almost entirely from folks who never would’ve found our candidates otherwise.</p>
<p>Fun fact: unlike the PACs, the Long Leaf Pine Slate is completely invisible on NC campaign finance reports. All the reports show is the donors, not the online channel they used. This keeps the Republican oppo researchers guessing and the media clueless. But the candidates know very well, because their ActBlue candidate dashboards show exactly what fundraising pages their money is coming from.</p>
<p>Legal stuff: every state is different, but this model is perfectly compliant everywhere I’m aware of. In North Carolina, there are certain conditions where you need to establish a political committee to promote candidates for office – like if you spend much money doing it. We thus had a (very, very low) spending limit for this project. This is the reason for the Slate’s <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">extremely basic webpage</a> – it’s literally just a hardcoded HTML file sitting on AWS. Dirt cheap! (I had lots of folks write in offering their help to create a much fancier webpage. This was very generous, but I could do that too. It’s basic because we couldn’t afford to do something nicer. I’m not kidding when I said our spending limit was low.)</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate/the-long-leaf-pine-slate-44e6abc51318">this explanatory post</a> about the Long Leaf Pine Slate that covers why raising money matters, why it’s hard for most candidates, and why that difficulty enables a lot of corporate corruption in our politics.</p>
<h2>What we did</h2>
<p>After I built the website and set up the ActBlue page, I knew that making a splash on social would be vital to winning eyeballs and attention for the Slate. So pre-launch, I begged a lot of big-audience folks on Twitter for retweets. Believe me, it felt as cringeworthy as it sounds. But incredibly, some obliged, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonkander">Jason Kander</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Bakari_Sellers">Bakari Sellers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjacksonnc/">Jeff Jackson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClintSmithIII">Clint Smith</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer">Dan Pfeiffer</a> and several more. The initial pop sent a lot of traffic and eyeballs on the project, and a little money. It made a difference. (Over time, I noticed that social eyeballs were good for traffic, but not so much for money.)</p>
<p>But what really made the Slate grow was just flogging it relentlessly every day. It was honestly a real grind. I sent hundreds of cold emails. (Didn’t work.) I promoted the Slate on Twitter, explaining why it was important. (Kinda worked.) <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate">I blogged about it</a> (useful for inbound traffic, sometimes for money).</p>
<p>What I found was that successfully fundraising requires you to be needy, persistent and a little bit pushy. Very, very few people will ever volunteer to give you money. You have to ask. And the vast majority of people you ask (directly or not) will say no. And just like in a job interview, you can’t take it personally. (If I cold emailed you and asked for money, sorry!) Asking for money sucks. I don’t like it and I don’t think anyone else does, either. But doing so for a good cause makes it a little easier, and over time, I got used to it.</p>
<p>I just kept doing this all year. Call it a “hustle” or “bootstrapping” or whatever you like, but slowly and gradually, folks started paying attention. We started raising more money. A real audience began to develop. I started writing <a href="https://thelongleafpineslate.substack.com/">email updates</a> to our donors, and those were a hit. Our list grew.</p>
<p>Speaking of email, another fun fact: as a fundraising page owner, ActBlue gives you the ability to ask your donors whether they want to share their email addresses with the recipient campaigns or not. I enabled this, so that every contributor to the Slate got to choose. The Slate still gets your email address, but whether recipient campaigns do was up to you. I now have a rather large donor list, and I made everyone a promise: the Slate will never, ever share or sell your email. It’s just not a deal I’m interested in. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>I knew we must be doing something right when Republican spies started sniffing around. I started getting emails from “supporters” I didn’t recognize, from obviously fake email addresses, asking for recordings from candidate calls. (<a href="https://americarisingpac.org/about/">America Rising</a> lackeys, I see you!) The Slate works in public, so this was fine – a vote of confidence if nothing else.</p>
<h2>So, what happened?</h2>
<p>I won’t bury the lede here: we still lost many of the races we backed.</p>
<p>So was this all a failure? Nah. The money mattered. But as I always remind people, money is just ammunition. It doesn’t buy races. We were able to raise money early in the cycle, which mattered a lot for our candidates. (For a campaign, $1 in October is worth $5 in January.) We funded candidates in “frontier” districts, where the fundamentals were hard, often in rural and exurban areas. Most of our candidates outperformed Biden in their districts, but unfortunately, the “top of the ticket” just didn’t perform as well in NC as we needed it to. Democrats nationwide had a rather poor showing downballot, so it wasn’t just us.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a total loss. Some of our candidates (both millennials!) won. In other places, we funded campaigns where there hadn’t been a really legit Democratic campaign in a decade or more. Even though we lost, there’s now a network of volunteers in place and up-to-date supporter lists that will make subsequent campaigns much stronger. To win, you need to run candidates in difficult districts, and when you do that, some of them are going to lose.</p>
<p>Besides – we were also badly outspent. Remember Duke Energy above? Well, aside from their direct (“hard”) giving, they sunk millions of dollars into a dark-money super PAC to run ads and mailers vilifying Democrats. So did the NC Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber’s super PAC, Citizens for a Better North Carolina, was run by two former top aides to Phil Berger (the GOP State Senate leader) who now have their own political consultancy. (Though of course, I’m sure all of their business was conducted without any …</p></div></div>

      <p>In a <a href="https://blog.owulveryck.info/2020/11/13/ontology-graphs-and-turtles-part-i.html">previous article</a>, I introduced the notion of ontology and knowledge graph.</p>
<p>Let’s go deeper into the concept and apply some technology to create an actual graph structure and eventually play with it.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, we well have parsed a triplestore in turtle format and created a graph structure in Go (based on <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph">gonum’s interface</a>)</p>
<h2 id="the-triplestore">The triplestore</h2>
<p>As explained in the last post, our knowledge database is a triple store. As a matter of example, I will rely on the ontology exposed by <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.</p>
<p>Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process […].
You can grab the complete ontology with this command:</p>
<p>The complete definition is available in turtle format and can be downloaded easily:</p>

</div>
</div><h3 id="parsing-the-store">Parsing the store</h3>
<h4 id="basic-explanation-of-the-parser">Basic explanation of the parser</h4>
<p>To parse the store, I am using the package <a href="https://github.com/deiu/gon3"><code>gon3</code></a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/andreisambra">Andrei Sambra</a>. Even though there is no license attached, Andrei allowed me to use it and to modify it for non-profit code.</p>
<p>I forked the repo to make some minor adjustments I needed for my experiments.</p>
<p>The entry point of the package is a <code>Parser</code> structure. Its purpose is to read a byte stream (<code>io.Reader</code>) and turn it into a functional structure called <code>Graph</code>. The <code>Graph</code> structure within the package is not representing all the edges. Still, it consists of an array of Triples (aka rdf graph):</p>
<div><div>

<pre><code><span>1

	<span>uri</span>     <span>*</span><span>IRI</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <code>Triple</code> is a structure holding three <code>Term</code>. One is the subject, one is a predicate, and the last one is the object.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2

<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the previous article, we saw that a term in RDF can be expressed in different types. As of today, the way to represent generic types in Go is to use interfaces. Therefore, a <code>Term</code> has an <code>interface</code> based definition:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

	<span>RawValue</span><span>()</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Two important objects are implementing the Term interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRI</li>
<li>Literal</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="generate-the-rdf-graph">Generate the RDF Graph</h4>
<p>If we glue all the concepts together we have the possibility to create a basic structure:</p>
<div><div>

<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then we can test the plumbing with the file we downloaded from schema.org previously:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="shell">&gt; cat schemaorg-current-http.ttl<span>|</span> go run main.go
graph contains <span>15323</span> triples
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>We can check that roughly the number of triple matches what’s expected by counting the rdf separators from the file:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>

<pre><code data-lang="shell">&gt; cat schemaorg-current-http.ttl <span>|</span> egrep -v <span>'^@|^$'</span> <span>|</span> egrep -c <span>' \.$| \;$|\,$'</span>
<span>15329</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The numbers are not identical but alike (the grep command does not evaluate the literal and some punctuation may be wrongly counted)</p>
<h2 id="generating-a-graph">Generating a Graph</h2>
<h3 id="understanding-the-graph-structure">Understanding the graph structure</h3>
<p>We have an “RDF” graph in memory; sadly, this structure is not a directed graph. I mean that it is not <em>de facto</em> possible to navigate from nodes to nodes or to identify the edges.</p>
<p>To create a graph, the best option in Go is to rely on the abstraction created by <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#Graph"><em>gonum</em></a></p>
<p>In Gonum a graph is an interface that manages two objects fulfilling the <code>Node</code> and <code>Edge</code> such as:</p>
<div><div>

<p><em>Note</em>: all comments have been removed for brevity. The full definition is available <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#Graph">here</a></p>
<p>Once the graph objects are fulfilling those interfaces, it becomes possible to use all the graph algorithms that have been implemented by the gonum team.
Please go to this link if you wish to learn more about the capabilities: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#section-directories">pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#section-directories</a></p>
<h4 id="our-graph-structure">Our graph structure</h4>
<p>We will create a top-level structure that will act as a receiver for our graph. For the graph itself, we rely on the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph/simple#DirectedGraph"><code>simple.DirectedGraph</code></a> implementation provided by the gonum’s project.</p>
<p>So we have:</p>
<div><div>

    <span>*</span><span>simple</span><span>.</span><span>DirectedGraph</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then we will create a function to create and fill our graph from our rdfGraph.</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="structure-of-the-graph">Structure of the graph</h3>
<p>Remember that the rdf graph contains an array of triples. Each triple is a term.</p>
<p>The object of a predicate is the subject of another triple. For example:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="turtle"><span>schema:</span><span>subject1</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>object1</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>schema:</span><span>object1</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>otherPredicate</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>object2</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Would lead to the following graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.owulveryck.info/assets/ontology/graph1.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This indicates a choice I’ve made: I want to produce a graph where its node corresponds to a subject declared <strong>inside</strong> the triplestore.
Therefore, in the example, <em>object2</em> is not a node because it is not defined as a subject to a sentence. It is relatively easy to change this behavior and reference other nodes, but let’s keep that apart.</p>
<h4 id="declaration-of-the-node">Declaration of the node</h4>
<p>The node object declaration is pretty straightforward. A node is a structure holding:</p>
<ul>
<li>an id</li>
<li>a subject as seen before</li>
<li>and a map of predicates and objects associated with the predicate.</li>
</ul>
<div><div>

<p>Adding a method <code>ID()</code> that returns an int64 makes it compatible with gonum’s Node interface.
Therefore it is possible to add it to a simple graph. So far, this codes compiles (but is useless):</p>

<p>We have created a graph with two nodes and an edge between them.</p>
<h3 id="parsing-the-rdf-graph-to-generate-our-directed-graph">Parsing the rdf graph to generate our directed graph</h3>
<p>The first thing we’ll do is to create a tree of terms. We do that thanks to a hash map.
The key is a subject, and the value is another map. The map value’s key is a predicate and the value is an array of objects (remember that a predicate can point to several objects)</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>tree</span> <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span><span>]</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span><span>][]</span><span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span><span>)</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>But before parsing the rdf graph to fill the tree, we have to address a little gotcha. a <code>Term</code> is an interface. Therefore it is a pointer. Therefore in the rdf graph, if we consider two <code>Terms</code> <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> such as:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>t1</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>NewLiteral</span><span>(</span><span>"bla"</span><span>)</span>
<span>t2</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>NewLiteral</span><span>(</span><span>"bla"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>t1</code> is different from <code>t2</code> (even is their values are the same)</p>
<p>To address this, we will track a dictionary of terms indexed by their <code>RawValue()</code>.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span></code></pre></td>

<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>Dict</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>rdf</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span>

    <span>//...
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then we iter over the triples from our rdf graph to fille the tree and the dictionary.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>for</span> <span>s</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>rdfGraph</span><span>.</span><span>IterTriples</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ... fill dict and tree
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Note</em>: for convenience, we will also set the dictionary as an attribute to our graph for later. The structure becomes:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>Graph</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

</div>
</div>
<p>We can now range over the tree, and create all the nodes in the graph for each subject:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3

<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Note</em>: once again, for convenience, we track the nodes in a hash map. This reference map has the subject as a key and the node as a value (its type is <code>map[rdf.Term]*Node</code>).</p>
<p>Finally, we loop once again through the tree to create the edges:</p>
<div><div>

<h2 id="putting-all-together">Putting all together</h2>
<p>Now that we have the graph builder ok, we can test it with the data from schema.org we downloaded earlier.</p>
<p>Let’s write a simple program that creates the graph and do a simple query. For example, we may want to get all the nodes directly linked to the  <code>PostalAddress</code> in schema.org.</p>

If you have not not seen it yet, go stream that masterpiece right now. #spoilers</p><p id="0d41"><strong>Why is this particular line so important?</strong> Because it is part of the keychain needed to unlock the many abstract concepts Lynch and Mark Frost presents to us, the viewers. The line is from the episode where Mike enters the dream of agent Cooper, revealing clues about Laura Palmers killer. What I find interesting about this line is its deceptive yet clear intention. The viewer is told what to pay attention to, but the dreamy context suggest we might be deceived.</p><p id="f29a">But some things are just what it is, how it sounds.</p><p id="57db"><em>Intuition guides us, one screen at the time.</em></p><p id="4949">For 10 years, I was writing for various advertising companies. My job was to craft words to lure the reader into whatever brand-context I was working on at that time, often with the help of abstractions of concepts, allegories, and other creative tools. It taught me a lot about perception and how I could, very subtly, plant hints for the viewer to decipher the brand message. But most importantly, it made me understand how the brain systematically create mental concepts to percieve and understand the world around it. Words play a crucial part in this process. An incredible 50 % of all words we hear cannot be understood out of context (when presented in isolation). By using concepts, the brain learns to categorize and make sense of all this variable noisy flow of information.</p><p id="b300">How ironic, you might think, that I found clarity in one of the most surreal dreamscapes ever to air on TV in our lifetime. To me, that’s the beauty of inspiration. It rises to our consciousness like wild salmon jumping upstream a river, striving to get a foothold in our mind amidst all the noise.</p><p id="4668">Like Lynch and Frost, I left the keys in plain sight for the audience to discover and interpret. Creative advertising requires just that, an idea we, the creators, code, and then let the audience decode. But UX Writing very often requires quite the opposite. You must write it like it is.</p><p id="856a">It has always been a beautiful mystery to me, how clarity has the power to shape us. How it informs us simply by being less intrusive or more truthful. <br>To me clarity is not the equivalent of writing short and efficient sentences. It can be about that, but not just that. Clarity is about finding the true essence of whatever you’re trying to convey. It’s what will make your followers believe you or not and go where you’re guiding them. Or not.</p><blockquote><p id="edd9"><strong><em>Just do it</em></strong></p><p id="2f63"><strong><em>I have a dream</em></strong></p><p id="78b1"><strong><em>Fire, walk with me</em></strong></p></blockquote><p id="d321">But clarity is also this</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1660/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png" width="830" height="1170" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/42/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Airbnb safely disarming thousands of anxious customers with one single line of text.</figcaption></figure><p id="e258">The real challenge is to fuse the two worlds into one.

He managed to eliminate the inevitable noise surrounding any world-changing project and devote all his attention to making it the next big thing.</p><p id="4ba2">Regardless of age, title and which floor you work on, there is a valuable lesson to be learned from this, Focus is needed to build great stuff, but it also essential for knowing when your brand needs to speak up. Or when to shut up.</p><p id="a94a">Understanding when to do what requires <strong>the ability to listen</strong>. I will listen to what the customer says about their experience. Pay attention to what the designers have to say about their intentions and challenges. Concentrate as programmers show me the project’s specifics and possibilities.</p><p id="879e">Jobs did this and was not afraid to change his mind should it benefit his creative singularity.

Therefore we make and effort to portray ourselves, man and brand, in a way that will serve as purposeful and friendly for our peers. From a brand point of view we would very much like people to feel what we want them to feel about us. This is usually where marketing says “we got this”. And they probably do. Persuasion is needed to increase awareness and market shares. But what happens after we get their attention?</p><p id="fe63">This is where guidance and clarity is provided and needed, not juicy headlines and rethorical tropes. Now it’s time to go with (and steer) the flow.</p><p id="eca1">Some people understand this process intuitively and how to utilize it in many different ways. In a talk at Design Matters 2019, Senior Product Writer at Slack <a href="https://medium.com/u/6aad0c825c59?source=post_page-----2b81f09aadfc--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Schmidt</a> shared insight from Slacks early days on how language could be a tool for identifying “bad” design, and how they discovered when to inject brand personality and how to do it. They came up with a very simple and interesting rule:</p><p id="f0e8"><strong>Never try to make the user feel<br></strong>Instead, look for the feelings they’re already having.<br>And just be part of those.</p><p id="c24e"><strong>👇🏻</strong></p></div></div><div><div><p id="84c2">I believe Slack is on the right path when it comes to how they percieve UX Writing. They have chosen a much less intrusive approach in a world where our minds are bombarded with emotional hooks ready to be reeled in. But for enhancing your UX Writing, I think being subtle and aware (but don’t forget to surprise once in a while) will take you far.</p><p id="acbe">Is your brands presence needed for solving this particular task?<br>Or is it better to get out of the way for a bit? <br><a href="https://uxplanet.org/the-power-of-whitespace-a1a95e45f82b" rel="noopener"><strong>Treat words in the same way designers treat white space.</strong></a></p><p id="cf73">My family owns a summer cabin near the ocean. In my younger days, I would cruise around in our family’s tiny motorboat. That was when I learned the concept of a rudder, a gentle device for navigating smoothly across the sea. This information suddenly reappeared a few years ago when I was writing about ergonomic seating. The company I wrote for had designed a new office chair that kept the person in it slightly moving while sitting down. One of them sat in the chair and used their feet to move around. Seeing this, I suggested to the designers that the feet act as a rudder to navigate the body. According to them, this was a perfect description of what they had accomplished.</p><p id="c439"><strong>I looked. I listened. And I found the embellishment I was looking for.</strong></p><p id="5e4a">In this ocean of information we’re slowly drowning in, I like to think of microcopy as an invisible rudder for our intuition. It’s there to guide you through interactive waters, shallow or deep, without you seeing it. If you can see the rudder, you’ve probably hit bottom, and then you have to slow down to understand the situation. When designing interactivity, people crave fluidity. Like in a musical piece that captivates us or in a movie that enthralls us with great dialogue and scenery. Or even a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 whose job is to help us navigate 60+ hours of content while keeping us immersed in their universe. Well played.</p><p id="54c3">Our understanding of the world is layered in mental concepts. Everything can be stripped down to its very basic components. Even what we know to be basic components has its own basic components. By understanding this, one becomes humble when faced with the task of understanding complex matters. Or answering complicated questions.</p><p id="24c2">Whenever I write, my goal is always to find the simplest version of the truth intended. By truth, I mean the pieces of information I relay to people who desire an outcome of some sort, typically in an app or landing page.

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

November 26, 2020 | https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>The majority of software engineering literature portrays object-oriented programming as distinct from, and often irreconcilable with, functional programming. This is, of course, a false dichotomy, as the techniques encouraged by functional programming are applicable in even the most object-oriented languages. Yet object-orientation, being perhaps history’s most popular software paradigm, has popularized its tenets, and occasionally we can see them show up even in programming languages like Haskell, a language about as antithetical to the object-oriented philosophy as possible.</p>
<p>In this piece, I’ll describe a common example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">information hiding</a> in ALGOL-style languages like Java, then express that in terms compatible with Haskell. We’ll then use this technique to port a <em>responder chain</em> to Haskell, demonstrating how Haskell supports dynamic function dispatch in the presence of hidden type information. I write this not because I expect to break any new ground—all the techniques I use here are long-documented in the literature, and Haskell veterans will probably find little new in this post<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>Those familiar with the care and feeding of existential types may wish to skip to the penultimate section, which contains a couple useful data types that I haven’t yet seen in the wild.</span></span>—but because the existing resources are scattered, perhaps oddly so given how central dynamic dispatch is to most programming languages that aren’t Haskell, and because exploring the edge cases in the design illustrates the compromises inherent in language and library design.</p>

<p>Most of the world’s statically-typed programming languages allow their users to write code resembling the following Java:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>Comparable</span> <span>someFn</span>() {</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    <span>return</span> <span>"a concrete String value"</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Syntactically, this code is uncontroversial: it’s a function that returns a value. Its only interesting aspect lies in the function signature−even though the function body returns a value of type <code>String</code>, its return type is declared to be <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html"><code>Comparable</code></a>, which is not a concrete data type, but a Java <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">interface</a>. As such, we cannot treat the result of this function call as the <code>String</code> it actually is; we can only interact with it via the methods defined on the <code>Comparable</code> interface. This application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">rule of least power</a> is a useful one, even in a strongly-typed language like Haskell: sometimes we want to hide the implementation details of a function’s return type.</p>
<p>We can try to write the same thing in Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>someComparableValue ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-2">someComparableValue _ <span>=</span> <span>"a concrete string value"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Because this is not semantically-valid Haskell, we get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:3:27: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘[Char]’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          someComparableValue :: forall a. Ord a =&gt; Int -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>Haskell’s typechecker looks at the body of this function and says “hey, man, you’re returning a concrete string value here, not ’any type that is <code>Ord</code>–erable.’” Though this is a valid notion in Java, it’s not valid in Haskell. Another perspective on this is that Java allows a value to have more than one type: we can treat a Java string literal as a value of type <code>java.lang.String</code>, or of type<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>even though <code>Comparable</code> is an interface, not a concrete type</span></span> <code>Comparable</code>, or of its superclass <code>java.lang.Object</code>. However, since Haskell doesn’t support inheritance, Haskell treats its values as having one, and only one, type. Working around this takes a judicious application of an existential type.</p>

<p>In Haskell, an <em>existential</em> data type is one that is defined in terms not of a concrete type, but in terms of a quantified type variable, introduced on the right-hand side of the data declaration. This is, as is the case for so many Haskell concepts, not a particularly helpful definition in the abstract. It’s easier to show than to tell, so let’s take a look at one of the canonical examples of an existential type: a <code>Showable</code> type that wraps any type that implements the <code>Show</code> interface.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are several interesting things about this data type. Firstly, it uses the <code>forall</code> keyword to introduce the <code>a</code> type variable: given that we’re dealing with <em>exist</em>-ential types, it threw me for a loop that there wasn’t an <code>exists</code> keyword.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Scala reserves a <code>forSome</code> keyword for this purpose, which I think reads a little more accurately in terms of the intent of introducing this type variable: using the phrase “for all” is a bit inapposite given that the <code>Showable</code> constructor is applied to single values at a time.</span></span> Considering the constructor of <code>Showable</code> is perhaps more enlightening:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>t <span>Showable</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can read this as “<code>Showable</code> is a constructor that takes, for all types <code>a</code> such that <code>a</code> implements <code>Show</code>, an <code>a</code> value, and returns a value of type <code>Showable</code>, the internal <code>a</code> value of which is no longer visible to the world once it’s been applied.”</p>
<p>Secondly, we can’t use a <code>newtype</code> to declare an existential. Attempting to write the following:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>results in an error message:</p>
<pre><code>• A newtype constructor cannot have a context in its type
  Showable :: forall a. Show a =&gt; a -&gt; Showable
• In the definition of data constructor ‘Showable’
  In the newtype declaration for ‘Showable’
</code></pre>
<p>When we consider typeclasses as <a href="https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/fluent-polymorphism-type-applications.html">dictionaries</a>, this restriction makes more sense: in GHC Core, this <code>Show a</code> constraint will be represented as a hypothetical <code>ShowDict</code> data type containing implementations for the <code>show</code>, <code>showsPrec</code>, and <code>showList</code> functions. In this light, we can see that <code>Showable</code> takes <em>two</em> parameters, not one: an <code>a</code> value to wrap, as well as the <code>ShowDict</code> dictionary associated with that value’s type. Newtypes exist to wrap single values, and here we’re wrapping both a datum and its associated <code>Show</code> dictionary: as a result, here we need a <code>data</code> declaration, even though the associated <code>Showable</code> constructor takes only one value (in Haskell surface syntax). This is an understandable limitation, though it would be cool if existential values of this sort could opt into the <code>deriving</code> mechanism in the manner of newtypes.</p>
<p>A third interesting thing: we can’t write a function that unwraps this data type. What might seem like an intuitive type for the function is rejected:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>-- GHC will reject this.</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>unwrapShowable ::</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb8-3">unwrapShowable (<span>Showable</span> a) <span>=</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can see this explained a little more closely if we use the record selector syntax.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> {<span> getShowable ::</span> a }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Attempting to use <code>getShowable</code> as a function that extracts some arbitrary <code>Show</code>–inhabiting type produces a well-explained error messages:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:1:1: error:
    • Cannot use record selector ‘getShowable’ as a function due to escaped type variables
      Probable fix: use pattern-matching syntax instead
    • In the expression: getShowable
</code></pre>
<p>The mental model I use here is that applying a constructor of an existential type serves as a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">event horizon</a> for type information. In other languages we can assemble heterogenous lists natively; in Haskell, by contrast, we have to opt into it explicitly: applying the <code>Showable</code> constructor to a value swallows its type information. We can’t write a function, whether the hand-written <code>unwrapShowable</code> or descending from our <code>getShowable</code> record selector, that unwraps some arbitrary type out of an existential. All that is retained is the ability, given a proper <code>case</code> statement to unwrap the value within the existential, to <code>Show</code> the value contained therein: it cannot <em>escape</em> its scope, as the error message above explains<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>We can, however, use the <code>getShowable</code> record selector to update the wrapped value present in a <code>Showable</code>.</span></span>.</p>
<p>We can, as I mentioned above, cross the event horizon with a <code>case</code> statement, binding the <code>Show</code>–conforming contents to a variable name:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>let</span> shown <span>=</span> <span>case</span> x <span>of</span> <span>Showable</span> val <span>-&gt;</span> <span>show</span> val</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Inside the right-hand-side of this <code>case</code> statement, we have a value <code>x</code> in scope. A quick inquiry with type holes reveals the type we expect:</p>
<pre><code>• Relevant bindings include
    x :: a (bound at &lt;interactive&gt;:28:15)
  Constraints include Show a (from &lt;interactive&gt;:28:11-15)
</code></pre>
<p>All we know about this value <code>x</code> is that we can call <code>Show</code> on it. Other than passing it to the basic combinators (<code>id</code> and <code>const</code>), that’s <em>all we can do</em> with this value. Any bit of type information has been lost, replaced instead with <em>capabilities</em>, via typeclasses. Again, when we consider typeclasses as dictionary parameters, we can visualize how this works on a core-calculus level: we discard type information, including only the relevant dictionaries provided by the context of the <code>forall</code>.</p>
<p>A fourth and final interesting thing about this type is that you can write it, using the <code>GADTs</code> GHC extension, without an explicit <code>forall</code> keyword:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">  <span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This stems from the fact that GADTs allow us to introduce per-constructor type variables and associated constraints, even if the type variable is not visible externally. Another thing to note is that data declarations containing existential values don’t have to be limited to a single value: they can hold concrete values, or values expressed with more <code>forall</code>–introduced type variables.</p>

<p>Being able to hide implementation details of a function’s return type is all well and good, but many users are going to need to convert (or attempt to convert) from an existential type back into a concrete type. Java provides this functionality with the <code>instanceof</code> operator and its cast syntax:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>Comparable</span> c = <span>someFn</span>();</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>if</span> c <span>instanceof</span> <span>String</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-3">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Got a string: "</span> + (<span>String</span>)c);</span>
<span id="cb14-4">} <span>else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-5">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Casting to a String here would raise a ClassCastException"</span>);</span>
<span id="cb14-6">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a consequence of all Java objects descending from <code>java.lang.Object</code>, and the ability of the <code>instanceof</code> operator to query the type of an object at runtime. Though …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I could probably achieve 300% more in 6 years as a programmer if I knew these things when I started.</p>
<h2 id="coding-is-not-about-the-coding">Coding Is Not About The Coding</h2>
<p>What do you think programming is about?</p>
<p>Writing code?</p>
<p>Writing good code?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>It's just a part of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Programming is not about coding, programming is about solving problems with coding.</strong></p>
<p>End customers don’t care what technologies, languages, frameworks, or methodologies you use. They care only about one thing, whether your product solves their problem or not.</p>
<p>That’s why no one cares what technologies Google search is using under the hood. Until people can find relative information with it, they will use it.</p>
<p>It’s the number one thing I wish I knew when I started programming.</p>
<p>I would spend less time writing “best code” and more time solving customer’s problems best.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t write code just to write code, solve customer’s problems with the code.</strong></p>
<h2 id="communication-skills-more-important-than-coding-skills">Communication Skills More Important Than Coding Skills</h2>
<p>When I just started my career, lack of social skills was not my main problem. But when I moved higher, to the middle, senior, and leadership position, my weak soft skills became my Achilles heel.</p>
<p>When you work on a product with a group of different people (engineers, designers, managers), communication is the only thing that makes you a “team” and helps you effectively develop the product.</p>
<p>Lack of social skills does the opposite, it decreases the product development time and overall productivity.</p>
<p>Here is the real situation you might face:</p>
<p>The leadership team tells your product manager that they want to create a new product feature and put it in the next product release. It’s not urgent, they just want to release it as soon as possible (as always).</p>
<p>The product Manager calls you on Zoom, tells you what you need to build, and asks, <em>“How much time do you need to build it?”</em></p>
<p>You are doing a rough calculation and tell, <em>“I need 20 hours.”</em></p>
<p>The Product Manager is not satisfied with your answer. He wants to release it as soon as possible and show the management that he can deliver results fast (this is a very common situation).</p>
<p>So he asks you, <em>“Can you build it for 10 hours? We really need this feature in the next product release!”</em></p>
<p>And you know that you can if you cut the corners (no tests, messy code) but then you will need to refactor it, and it will take an additional 30 hours. Because other engineers will work with your messy code when you release it. And after refactoring, you will need to integrate their code with yours.</p>
<p>So here’s what will happen next. If you have bad social skills, you will not convince the Product Manager that you actually need 20 hours to build this feature. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Product Managers often have good social skills, from my experience. So if you can’t convince him that refactoring later is worse than spending 20 hours right now, he will easily argue with you and convince you that “refactoring later is okay.” And the whole team will lose additional 30 hours for this refactoring (I don't count the time to fix unpredictable bugs after).</p>
<p>But if you have good communication skills you will be able to convince him of the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>So improve your social skills as well as coding skills</strong> (send memes in the group chats on Slack or something).</p>
<p>And remember one simple truth:</p>
<p><strong>People work with people, not machines.</strong></p>
<h2 id="regular-breaks-help-to-program-better">Regular Breaks Help To Program Better</h2>
<p>For 4 years I always feel exhausted after work. Somehow I could productively work only for a couple of hours. After that, I didn't have much energy. Until I learned about the Pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>It’s quite simple. You work for 25 minutes and take a break for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Your working routine becomes:</p>
<p>8:00-8:25 – Work</p>
<p>8:25-8:30 – Break</p>
<p>8:30-8:55 – Work</p>
<p>8:55-9:00 – Break</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I tried it for a week and was surprised at how focused, energetic, and productive I became  (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/the-science-behind-the-pomodoro-technique/">the science behind Pomodoro</a>)</p>
<p>Then I went further and implemented the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nickbulljs/status/1303037682294173699">52+17 system</a> and my productivity levels spiked by 200%.</p>
<p><strong>So</strong> <strong>take regular breaks if you want to operate at your maximum capabilities.</strong></p>
<h2 id="10x-engineers-dont-exist">10X Engineers Don’t Exist</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my career, I thought that a great programmer is a person who knows tons of programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Such a mindset only gave birth to my impostor syndrome. I thought that I don't deserve my current position, my salary, that I am a “fraud.” So I started to follow every popular developer on Twitter, read every technical news, and thousands of developer blogs just to convince myself that I deserve what I have and to feel more close to the title “great developer.”</p>
<p><strong>This was not a healthy behavior.</strong></p>
<p>But it helped me to discover that a lot of people I followed (I thought were 10X engineers) actually didn’t know a lot of things. They may know how to do some complex things that require a lot of different deep knowledge in a couple of fields and at the same time don’t know some primitive things. Like to know how to design highly scalable database architectures but don’t know how vertical-align an element with CSS.</p>
<p>Big thanks to those developers, like Dan Abramov (creator of Redux) for <a target="_blank" href="https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/">this article</a>, they cured my imposter syndrome and showed me that it is okay not to know something.</p>
<h2 id="programming-is-not-hard-if-you-know-how-to-learn">Programming Is Not Hard If You Know How To Learn</h2>
<p>When I started to learn JavaScript, it was hard. <strong>Because I learned the wrong way.</strong></p>
<p>Read a lot of theory without the practice, no routine, no end goal. Chaos.</p>
<p>I thought it was normal to learn like this. Until I discovered <strong>deliberate practice.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a purposeful and systematic type of practice (learning).</p>
<p>The difference between normal practice and deliberate is that deliberate requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.</p>
<p>After I applied a deliberate practice, I began to notice how fast I'm progressing with learning JavaScript. My knowledge started to stick for a long time, not just for 5 minutes after tutorials. I created the end goal, why I am learning JavaScript, and understand what I need to learn, and what I don't.</p>
<p>📌 <em>Quick note: I’m creating a JavaScript course where I’m using deliberate practice to <strong>combine modern and practical JavaScript theory with a lot of real-world practice</strong> to teach you how to become a skilled JavaScript developer with knowledge of modern language features. <a target="_blank" href="https://javascriptcoursethatworks.com/">Join here.</a></em></p>
<p>So here is what you need to perform deliberate practice on your own:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Teacher:</strong> provides practice activities designed to help you improve performance.</li>
<li><strong>Perform at maximum effort:</strong> constantly being taken out of your comfort zone.</li>
<li><strong>Well defined and specific goals:</strong> not just “overall improvement.”</li>
<li><strong>To be in focus:</strong> give your full attention, no distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Do conscious actions:</strong> no autopilot.</li>
<li><strong>Instant response to feedback and modifying your strategy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you start learning a new language, technology, framework, whatever, stick to these rules to get big results as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-best-programming-language">There is no “best programming language”</h2>
<p>There is no <strong>best "something"</strong> in our world. Only <strong>best in something</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s take cars. How can we choose the best car in the world? By speed? By safety? By what criteria?</p>
<p>It’s impossible.</p>
<p>We can only choose the best car in a certain category. Like the safest car. Or the best offroad car.</p>
<p>And if we look deeper, every category solves some problems.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We have children and we take them to school every day, we want our children to be safe on the way to school.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the safest car.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We go camping every weekend, so we need some vehicle that can easily get us to places that are difficult to access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the best off-road car.</p>
<p>The same is with programming languages. Some languages and tools are better at solving some problems than others.</p>
<p>If we want to build an interactive website, we choose JavaScript.</p>
<p>If we want to go with ML/AI, we choose Python.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>there is no best programming language, there is the best programming language to ...</strong></p>
<p>So start with a problem first, then pick a language to solve it.</p>

<p>Hear that? It’s the sound of Mac fans. No, not your shiny new M1 Mac’s fans—chances are, you’ll never hear those—but rather, the sound of <em>excitement</em> rippling through the Mac community. This is something big. Really big. Now, I’m only 33, but someday when I go full fuddy-duddy I will speak of this: the great Intel/Apple Silicon transition. The beginning of a new era at Apple.</p>



<p>All that sounds dramatic, of course, but it’s interesting to trace all of the different paths that led us to this point. The A-Series chips, the introduction of Metal, rapid machine learning gains, the gradually degrading repairability scores as components became more integrated, the Secure Enclave, a new super fast emulation layer, new unified memory architecture, and 5nm process… years and years of work have now come to fruition with the first Apple Silicon chips for Mac. And our minds are blown.</p>



<p>Suddenly, we’re handed a thin, entry-level fanless laptop that performs better than almost every other Mac computer out there, and a low-end MacBook Pro and Mac Mini that make current Mac Pro owners sweat and clutch their wheels. So many questions abound. What new hardware designs will these gains make possible? What on earth does Apple have in store for its high-end Macs? Will anyone else even be able to compete? It’s an exciting time to be a Mac lover, but, surprise: this post isn’t really about the Mac. It’s about the iPad.</p>



<p>There’s no question that Apple has struggled to craft a cohesive, compelling narrative for the iPad. For a long time, there seemed to be a distinct lack of product vision. Everyone likes to speculate over what role Steve Jobs ultimately intended the iPad to have in people’s lives, but not only is that pointless, it’s also irrelevant. We don’t need Steve to tell us what the iPad is good for. We know what it’s good for, and we can easily imagine what it <em>could</em> be good for, if only Apple would set it free.</p>



<p>Just as Apple left us with great expectations for its Pro Mac line-up, the latest iPad Air also raises the bar in new and interesting ways. The Air served as sort of an appetizer for the new M1 chips, while also receiving a generous trickle-down of features from the iPad Pro, including USB-C and support for the latest keyboard and Pencil accessories. There have been rumors of new mini-LED displays for the next-gen iPad Pros, but it’s going to take a lot more than new display tech to set the Pros apart.</p>



<p>Francisco Tolmasky (<a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1330033394349125642?s=20">@tolmasky</a>) recently tweeted:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A sad but inescapable conclusion from the impressive launch of the M1 is just how much Apple squandered the potential of the iPad. The iPad has had amazing performance for awhile, so why is the M1 a game changer? Because it’s finally in a machine we can actually <em>do things on</em>.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Francisco is right: Power and performance aren’t the bottleneck for iPad, and haven’t been for some time. So if raw power isn’t enough, and new display tech isn’t enough, where does the iPad go from here? Will it be abandoned once more, lagging behind the Mac in terms of innovation, or will Apple continue to debut its latest tech in this form factor? Is it headed toward functional parity with the Mac or will it always be hamstrung by Apple’s strict App Store policies and seemingly inconsistent investment in iPadOS?</p>



<p>It’s clear that Apple <em>wants</em> the iPad Pro to be a device that a wide variety of professionals can use to get work done. And since so many people use web apps for their work, the introduction of “desktop” Safari for iPad was an important step toward that goal. The Magic Keyboard and trackpad was another step.</p>



<p>Here are ten more steps I believe Apple could and should take to help nudge the iPad into this exciting next era of computing.</p>



<ol><li>Give the iPad Pro another port. Two USB 4.0 ports would be lovely.</li><li>Adopt a landscape-first mindset. Rotate the Apple logo on the back and move the iPad’s front-facing camera on the side beneath the Apple Pencil charger to better reflect how most people actually use their iPad Pros.</li><li>Introduce Gatekeeper and app notarization for iOS. The process of side-loading apps should <em>not</em> be as simple as downloading them from the App Store. Bury it in Settings, make it slightly convoluted, whatever: just have an officially-sanctioned way of doing it.</li><li>Ruthlessly purge the App Store Guidelines of anything that prevents the iPad from serving as a development machine. Every kind of development from web to games should be possible on an iPad. And speaking of games—emulators should be allowed, too.</li><li>Release a suite of professional first-party apps at premium prices. If someone can edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their M1 MacBook Air, they should be able to edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their iPad Pro. I refuse to believe that these pro apps can’t be re-imagined and optimized for a touch experience. If Apple leads the way in developing premium software for iPad, others will follow.</li><li>Make it possible to write, release, and install plug-ins (if appropriate) for the aforementioned first party apps.</li><li>Bring App Library to the iPad and allow widgets to be positioned anywhere on the Home Screen. This isn’t groundbreaking, it just annoys the heck out of me.</li><li>Release a new keyboard + trackpad case accessory that allows the iPad to be used in tablet mode without removing it from the case.</li><li>Introduce Time Machine backups for iPadOS.</li><li>5G, ofc.</li></ol>



<p>In the end, fostering a vibrant community of iPad app developers can only stand to benefit the Mac (and vice-versa).</p>



<p>It’s simple: people love their iPads. They love them so much they wish they could do even more with them. The new M1 Macs should give iPad fans reason to be excited; now that we’ve seen hints of what future Macs can be, it’s time for the iPad to reassert itself—to remind us once again who it’s for, and what makes it special.</p>



<p>In other words: Your move, iPad.</p>

                    <p>For the last 60 years, we’ve seen consistently low productivity growth rates in the US and across the Western world. Meanwhile, recent scientific discoveries seem to be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">less fundamental</a> to our understanding of the world than previous breakthroughs have been. While the growth of digital technology has been tremendous since the 1990s, it’s the only significant part of our world that seems to have been changing. To look up from our smartphones is to see a physical environment that looks basically the same as it did in 1970. Innovation has been constrained to the world of bits and left the world of atoms mostly untouched.</p><p>This might finally be changing. Last month, the economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-05/how-much-worse-can-things-get-that-question-may-be-a-good-sign">speculated</a> that we may be seeing signs that this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> is ending. Since his article was published, we’ve already seen almost a dozen announcements that have only driven home the point further. There seem to be cracks in the Great Stagnation and light is peeking through on the other end. </p><p><strong>Innovation in the physical world</strong><br>Most obviously, the recent announcement of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/">successful development of several vaccines</a> to the novel coronavirus are a sign that America (with some help from Germany) is still capable of achieving Big Things when we are pushed to it. Despite consistent failings of the US regulatory state in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/">delaying the adoption</a> of face masks and in <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/timeline-the-regulationsand-regulatorsthat">slowing the rollout</a> of mass testing, the US essentially bet the farm that our strong biotech clusters would be able to create a vaccine to a new disease in record time, and it looks like we’re going to be able to do it in under a year! </p><p>It’s worth highlighting just how speedy this development timeline is when compared to the vaccines for diseases like polio and measles. </p><figure><img src="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1000w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination</figcaption></figure><p>And not only did we develop a new vaccine, we developed a new *type* of vaccine. mRNA vaccines have long been speculated to work, but this is the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-showing-potential-success-of-mrna-platform-a-first/">first instance</a> of a successful vaccine application in humans using this technique. </p><p>In transportation, the promise of driverless cars has long been a centerpiece for a tech-optimistic vision of safer roads, better-designed cities, and eliminating the drudgery of a morning commute through traffic. But the technical delays of the last few years (when compared to the most optimistic timelines) have become a rallying cry for the <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">tech-skeptic</a> as well. </p><p>It seems like they may finally be getting here. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/">Waymo announced</a> that their long-running pilot program in Arizona is going to be open to the public <a href="https://twitter.com/jjricks_/status/1316318196375330816">without any safety driver</a> in the front seat. Days later, Elon Musk and Tesla rolled out a new self-driving beta program. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These two guys used a drone to make a video of Tesla's new "full self-driving" software in action. The drone, the self-driving car, and the global video-steaming service were all been science fiction when I was born. Living in the future is neat. <a href="https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc">https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc</a></p>— Timothy B. Lee (@binarybits) <a href="https://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1321102111883579397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This is a remarkable engineering feat, especially on Waymo’s end. It shows the company can successfully lead product development in an industry that relies on more stringent safety-critical engineering instead of the release-and-iterate model that its parent company grew up with. Waymo is evidence that Silicon Valley can “move at a moderate pace and not break things” when it needs to.</p><p>Granted, it’s unclear how long until and at what pace deployment of AVs to the rest of the country and the world will happen. If the Waymo model looks to be successful, it will be a steady, resource-intensive process of region-by-region expansion as the cars learn to handle new operational design domains and are rigorously validated in each city before the keys are turned over to the AI. In other words, expansion could look more like a cell phone coverage map than a software update that is instantaneously available everywhere. </p><p>But still, this is a significant, tangible mile marker that the industry has passed. AVs are operating in the wild now. We get to talk about *when* we reach the driverless future, not *if*. </p><p>In addition to the almost ho-hum daily progress in solar, wind, and battery technology where prices have fallen <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what">90</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=491f10ec2c84">70</a>, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019">87</a> percent over the last ten years, we’ve also started to hear very promising reports about the development of more fundamental breakthroughs. The NYT reports that a compact nuclear fusion reactor is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Very Likely to Work</a>” after a major theoretical advancement. There was also a fantastic David Robert’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">deep dive into geothermal energy</a> and the promise of advanced geothermal (whereby water pumped into the ground through a closed loop reaches a high enough temperature that it becomes “supercritical” and can carry 10x more energy per unit mass), in particular. Either technology, if perfected, would provide abundant, zero-carbon, baseload energy that is available anywhere around the world. </p><p>Cowen mentions briefly the huge market growth we’ve seen in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives. A few weeks ago it was announced that Impossible Foods, one of the largest actors in the industry is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/20/impossible-foods-will-double-rd-to-eliminate-animal-farming/">doubling their R&amp;D team</a> as they seek to take on plant-based milk, steak, and fish as well as improve the supply chains for plant proteins. In tandem, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/11/10/mcdonalds-mcplant-sandwich/">just announced</a> that in 2021 they are going to be testing out a new McPlant menu.</p><p><strong>Digital innovation continues apace</strong></p><p>Not to be left out, in the digital world we’ve been seeing impressive progress as well. AI techniques like deepfakes which have been heralded as the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/deepfakes-destroy-democracy">death knell for democracy</a> are now being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/nvidia-used-neural-networks-to-improve-video-calling-bandwidth-by-10x/">deployed by NVIDIA</a> to increase video fidelity while cutting bandwidth transmission for video calls by a factor of 10. In general, techniques to reduce bandwidth use are greatly underrated, and it’s going to be exciting to see the ways in which smarter compression can perhaps bring similar efficiency gains across the board. </p><p>And now factor in the steady rollout of 5G network technologies which promise to increase the raw bandwidth available to all mobile devices. With the combination of smarter compression and vastly increased bandwidth we could be looking at a baseline 50x increase in network capacity over the next decade. It’s hard to predict ahead of time what new applications will be enabled by all this new capacity, but in retrospect it could look like another example of <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/how-bubbles-and-megaprojects-parallelize">parallel innovation</a> that both enables and is driven by the growth of VR/AR, driverless vehicles, and telehealth.*</p><p><em>*For those who are skeptical that increased capacity will generate new applications because a few cities have tried gigabit broadband<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/"> without much effect</a>, I would argue that both hardware and app developers are optimizing for the baseline user experience and we won’t see a ton of investment in new applications until we’ve changed the baseline capacity that developers can expect a sizeable user base to have. </em></p><p>Equally as impressive, Apple’s new M1 chip that was launched on November 10th seems to have taken the world by storm. As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">summarizes</a>: “To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are astonishingly good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer better, about what good computers need, are wrong.” Just as interesting is <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/what-is-the-apple-m1-chip-613935ea0903">how they did it</a>. By miniaturizing the whole system architecture and integrating it onto a single chip (no discrete RAM, graphics card, etc.) Apple has managed to pump out massive efficiency gains both in processing power and in battery life. (There’s perhaps a metaphor here for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/breaking-up-big-tech-is-hard-to-do-1532290123">value of integration</a> for large tech firms as well…)</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXP4ZnW93TIsJ_dJe3NVmevfz5eMUnNC6CS40Dz_S0568BDiQKr8K8LqT5Ja-kLnXUKnS1UkDQf_6WYzBhfGa4c99lQDfqudhQaDF-XCYBEkxNoP3Vo3FlGtLl3sGFQcdtHBlGbv" alt=""><figcaption>https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the virtual reality space has seen its most impressive entrant in years with the arrival of the Quest 2 from Facebook on October 13th. There is no VR headset that matches it on a performance/cost basis, and the relative simplicity and elegance of the system makes it an ideal entry point. The deliberately low entry barrier of $299 is meant to entice a large enough user base that it kickstarts the virtuous cycle of having a significant enough market for dedicated VR developers to make significant investments in new applications, which then drives new user growth. Facebook believes we finally have a minimum viable product for VR that means this kind of two-sided market is possible, and it is betting billions of dollars to make it happen. Early signs seem to show that it is working as intended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg">pre-orders reportedly 5x</a> larger than the original Quest, popular applications like Beat Saber seeing record growth, and all this with the upcoming holiday rush and a massive advertising blitz to come. </p><p>Notably, all of these announcements/developments I’ve outlined have occurred in just the last few months. This is by no means a comprehensive look at the exciting progress being made in many other fields. But the sheer scope and pace of tangible changes to our physical and digital words is something to be excited about.</p><p><strong>A few caveats </strong></p><p>Some of these innovations will boost productivity in the traditional ways that show up in economic growth statistics. We should strive for and celebrate those achievements. But some of these innovations won’t necessarily, instead they make human civilization more durable and sustainable in a variety of ways. In response, we should start to think of increased sustainability as a type of productivity. </p><p>A vaccine to the COVID pandemic is the most obvious example. While economic statistics won’t show a boost in productivity compared to the pre-COVID economy because of the vaccine, the ability to return to trend is itself incredibly valuable. In fact, measured labor productivity from the vaccine will likely fall as lower-wage …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>
In July 2020 I went on a color-scheme vision quest. This led to some research on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color spaces</a> and their utility, some investigation into the <a href="http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/#styling-guidelines">styling guidelines</a> outlined by the base16 project, and the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/color.el">color utilities</a> that ship within the GNU Emacs text editor. This article will be a whirlwind tour of things you can do to individual colors, and at the end how I put these blocks together.
</p>

<div id="text-h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620">
<p>
I've been a part of several Linux desktop customization communities since circa 2013. One big aspect of that is the colors used across various contexts – for me, it follows that part of the game is trying to make a cohesive system of colors that relate to each other in an understandable (and thus tweakable) way – know what I can do to individual colors when making a "color framework" helps immensely.
</p>

<p>
I'm colorblind. This means I might be really picky about some colors. For example, I don't like the color red used for emphasis in text – thin red lines look the same as thin black lines to me (and so, red text doesn't typically &gt;POP&lt; for me, unless it's bold or has some other emphasis included).
</p>

<p>
Bootstrapping builders exist for base16! If I can bootstrap on top of their system I get a lot of free coverage within the software ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Plus, I just find this sort of thing really fun. Visual feedback is pleasing. Finding the right colors makes my lizard brain return to monke.

<p>
This will be the focal point of inconsistency. The level of brightness, quality of screen, and ambient lighting level are all things that affect the value of the screen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_point">white point</a>, which is what everything else is relative too. Luckily you can (attempt to) account for this as well.

<p>
Color spaces are ways of defining colors in different sets of properties. They are the main tool you will have for reasoning about tweaking <i>individual</i> colors. You can then mess with these and convert them back into a format you can render (typically RGB) within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">color gamut</a> (a range of supported colors). Here I will be pretty high level, focusing on some visuals for what sorts of things these properties look like. When I define the valid values for ranges, I will be using the scale I've implemented in my <a href="#h-cb3c6479-7d62-4028-8942-2b033bb1247a">helpers</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0a664e8">

The one you know and love:  [R]ed, [G]reen, [B]lue. Your knobs are amounts of each. As you turn everything up, you approach <code>#ffffff</code> (and down, -&gt; <code>#000000</code>). This isn't particularly flexible in "ways you can think about colors".
</p>

<p>
Here is a gradient from <code>#cc3333</code> to <code>#33cc33</code> to <code>#3333cc</code>:
</p>

 


<p>
To show the lighting effect, let's repeat the above gradient, but instead of using <code>33</code> for filler, we'll use <code>99</code> – that's triple(!) the secondary color amounts:

<p>
Saturation in HSL is a controlled version of chromacity ("distance from gray"). See the wiki section for more details.
</p>


<p><a href="http://notes.neeasade.net/assets/posts/color_cylinder.png"><img src="http://notes.neeasade.net/assets/posts/color_cylinder.png" alt="color_cylinder.png"></a>
</p>

<p>
Hue has several defined points (at rotating 60° angles), I like to think of it like a color compass:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSL: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Let's see the effect saturation has:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
And lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org758eb61">
<h3 id="h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428"><span>3.3</span> <a href="#h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">HSLuv</a></h3>
<div id="text-h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">
<p>
<a href="https://www.hsluv.org/comparison/">hsluv</a> is an altered version of HSL that tries to be perceptually uniform with regards to lightness. HSL lightness by comparison is hard to make contrast comparisons in.
</p>

<p>
What does that mean for us? Well, let's take our above examples and recreate them in the HSLuv space:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSLuv: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Saturation:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p>

These scales definitely look more consistent when reasoning about lightness values. HSL's hue feels all over the place by comparison – though at the same time that might be a more natural color mixing feel.

The white point is a defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_illuminant">standard illuminate</a>  not intrinsic to the value of a color. It is an additional piece of information you provide to functions when converting into and out of the CIELAB colorspace.
</p>

<p>
The standard white point is defined as <code>d65</code> – in this section, every conversion will be made with <code>d65</code>. Here is a table of commonly used white points and their meaning (for values, see the bottom of the wikipedia link).

The knobs A and B allow you to play with the 4 primary colors of the LAB space. If you take a look at the values, you might notice that the more negative we go, we get "cooler" colors, while on the positive end, we get "warmer" colors.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at some LAB colors. The labels below will have the values of  <code>(L A B)</code> – Remember, A is green to red, B is blue to yellow (each with a value -100 to 100)

LCH is a "cylindrical" version of cieLAB. What that means for us is that Hue is different. Instead of 6 defined islands to sail to with our color compass, there are 4:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 90°</p>
<p>green, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 270°</p>
 </div> 


<p> LCH: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 90°), saturation 50%, luminance 50% </p> 


<p>
LCH lightness:
</p>
 


<p> LCH: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), chromacity 50%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Chromacity, "distance from gray" - very similar to Saturation (which I've seen cited as simply misnamed chromacity):
</p>

 


<p> LCH: chromacity scale 0-100% (step 10%), luminance 70%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Let's compare some spaces. We'll take some the RGB gradient from above, normalize the lightness in HSLuv and then maximize l[C]h, H[S]L, and H[S]Luv:
</p>

 


<p> original </p> 


 


<p> squash lightness to 50 in HSLuv </p>

For text, the Web Content Assembly Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum">link</a>. Let's take a look at some different text contrasts! I will steal the backgrounds used here from the base-16 grayscale sets: <code>#f7f7f7</code> and <code>#101010</code>. For reference, the contrast ratio between <code>#000000</code> and <code>#ffffff</code> is 21.0

I think it's pretty clear from these examples that higher contrast goes a long way in dark color schemes.

Color distance is a measure of how far apart colors are by properties in spaces. For example, let's take the 'magenta' color from above, and increase it's brightness and hue until we're some minimal distance away. We'll aim for 33(out of 100) measured in the CIELAB space:
</p>

<div>  
<p>0</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>35</p>
 </div> 


<p> CIELAB distance from the start color is shown </p> 


<p>
Color distance is useful because it lets us measure a kind of similarity between colors. You can use this to control where you stop transformations (color space property tweaks).

A gradient is where you travel from one color's initial property values to some other color's property values, collecting the intermediate steps.
