I understand why this province elected the UCP with historic turnout in 2019.</p>  <p>I get the appeal of that campaign, the lure of nostalgia that it evoked. It was a tempting fantasy, one in which Rachel Notley allied with Justin Trudeau, and Alberta's noble oil industry was beleaguered by a gaggle of environmentalists and socialists, who were conspiring to bring the province down.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I also understand why so many bought into the claim that by electing a conservative government, we could just make all of these problems go away; that Alberta would return to the glory days of 2014, or 2005, or 1994. Or 1973.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The 2019 campaign promised tax cuts that would bring the jobs back; fiscal discipline; fair deal panels that would put Ottawa in its place and highlight this province's growing, muscular sense of its own independence.</p>  <h2><strong>A white knight returns</strong></h2>  <p>Kenney promised to rescind the job-killing-carbon-tax. He promised to be a premier who would win the province glory, a white knight and returning prodigal son who would finally fight for Alberta.</p>  <p>He promised "war rooms" and inquiries that would finally unearth Alberta's nefarious enemies.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Somehow, this was all going to work wonders for pipeline capacity — which is why it made sense to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/keystone-xl-construction-pipeline-starts-alberta-1.5636449"><u>invest $1.5 billion</u></a> in taxpayer money in Keystone XL. Whoops.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Almost two years into this mandate, I have to ask: How has it been going? Is this working?&nbsp;</p>  <p>From the cheap seats, things don't look great. I've been trying to come up with one single solitary win since that election, and I can't find it. It looks to me like the UCP spun a fantasy in 2019 that it now can't make real.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And, yeah, this province has been hard hit by COVID-19, but I thought I was being generous by putting that file to the side for a moment.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Alberta Premier Jason Kenney&nbsp;reacts to Keystone decision:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="’This is a gut punch for the Canadian and Alberta economies’ says Kenney" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1846489155519-metadata-" title="’This is a gut punch for the Canadian and Alberta economies’ says Kenney"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/694/290/edm-kenney-keystone-gutpunch-jan20_2500kbps_1280x720_1846494275535.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Premier Jason Kenney responds to U.S. President Joe Biden’s move to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, calling it, "an insult directed at the United States's most important ally and trading partner."<!-- --> <!-- -->1:55</span></span></span></p>  <p>The jobs haven't come back. Alberta had a competitive corporate tax rate before the UCP was elected. It was always doubtful that cutting the rate even more was going to make a difference.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Our public finances are in shambles. A tax hike is <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/road-ahead-alberta-government-revenue-pst-carbon-tax-1.5871446"><u>inevitable</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Kenney did kill Notley's carbon tax — and then replaced it with another, less effective one. Meanwhile, this province's court challenge of the federal carbon tax is unlikely to hold up.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Kenney's "war room" is an international joke led by a PC-party loyalist who didn't get elected in 2019.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And that inquiry into foreign funding — dogged at the outset with reports that its commissioner, Steve Allan, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/steven-allan-calgary-edmonton-ucp-alberta-1.5358866"><u>awarded a sole-source $905,000 contract</u></a> to the law firm in which his own son was a partner, because, of course — has already devolved into a series of delays and controversies.</p>  <h2><strong>A clown show</strong></h2>  <p>The latest, that the inquiry spent $100,000 to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-inquiry-reports-commissioned-critics-1.5873580"><u>commission reports</u></a> from several external groups, including a U.S. firm called Energy in Depth,&nbsp;which is affiliated with&nbsp;the Independent Petroleum Association of America, and a paper from Calgary-based political scientist Barry Cooper, whose contribution was entitled: "Background Report on Changes in the Organization and Ideology of Philanthropic Foundations with a Focus on Environmental Issues as Reflected in Contemporary Social Science Research."</p>  <p>Meanwhile, Greenpeace, which has already been publicly excoriated by the Allan inquiry as "a new breed of zealots less interested in saving Planet Earth than in destroying the capitalist system," has yet to be contacted to provide any evidence at all. (In fact, Greenpeace has already issued <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/greenpeace-issues-legal-warning-to-alberta-inquiry-into-alleged-foreign-funded-anti-energy-campaigns-1.5879735"><u>a legal warning</u></a> to the inquiry.)</p>  <p>It should be noted here that we've spent an estimated $3.5 million on this clown show.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Put aside for a moment, dear Conservatives, the question of whether you think anything the inquiry is "investigating" is true. Instead, ask yourselves this question: whom is this inquiry going to convince?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Is anyone under the impression that a report informed by Cooper and the climate change denial group Friends of Science is going to turn the tide for Alberta?</p>  <p>What's the theory, here? Were we going to FedEx the Oval Office a final report that prompts Joe Biden into an epiphany on climate change?&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200919.1562288597!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/alberta-premier-jason-kenney.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Alberta Premier Jason Kenney launched an inquiry in July 2019 to see whether 'foreign-funded special interest' groups have been disseminating false information about the Alberta oil and gas industry.

How hard does Greenpeace really need to work to make Alberta look like a cartoonishly villainous backwater right now?&nbsp;</p>  <p>In November, Premier Kenney <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/ledge-post"><u>starred in a podcast</u></a> in which he criticized Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — Biden's campaign co-chair — over their attempts to decommission a segment of Enbridge's Line 5. Kenney noted that those fighting to cut off Alberta's oil and gas exports were "brain dead."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Kenney also said: "We thought it was essential to send a message to the interest groups trying to block us, that resistance is futile, that Alberta is determined to take control of our own destiny."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Again, I ask: How is this working?&nbsp;</p>  <h2><strong>Delusions of self-importance</strong></h2>  <p>For the record, I think Alberta has been treated unfairly and hypocritically; we clearly have been the target of international and national campaigns to obstruct oilsands development. That's not in dispute.</p>  <p>Ironically, many of those campaigns began to abate in 2015 when Notley introduced an aggressive carbon tax policy that demonstrated Alberta was taking climate change seriously.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And these anti-oilsands actors aren't the cause of all of our problems. The price of oil is down everywhere, and we're now producing a commodity that is extracted in abundance within the United States&nbsp;thanks to the fracking boom.</p>  <p>Further, global concern about climate change means more banks and major companies are disinvesting in a jurisdiction that goes full ride-or-die on coal and petroleum extraction.</p>  <p>Something needs saying here, and there's no way to say it kindly. Boom times and wealth have conditioned Albertans to believe that we matter a lot more than we do.</p>  <p>Money gave this province delusions of self-importance that is reflected in a premier whose bombastic bar-brawl banter is increasingly revealed as short-man bluster. We're the guy who gets drunk and picks a fight but can't actually land a punch.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I don't mean to be too mordant about all of this. I love Alberta, and I still think we have a lot going for us. We're good people, we work hard, and we pull together in a crisis. But we're a landlocked jurisdiction of four million on the high plain that happens to enjoy large oil and gas reserves that are costly and emissions-intensive to produce. By population, that puts us somewhere between Oklahoma and Oregon, and all the less important to a United States that is effectively energy independent.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In other words: we don't matter to these people.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5742717.1601348615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/keystone-xl-alberta.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Pipe sits ready to be used for the construction of the Canadian leg of the Keystone XL in Alberta near the town of Oyen.

And what's Canada going to do about it, exactly? Issue a letter of protest? Proclaim tariffs and boycotts that will hurt us more than it will hurt the U.S.? Oh wait, Kenney implied that we should do exactly that on Wednesday, or Alberta&nbsp;would "go further in our fight for a fair deal in the federation."&nbsp;</p>  <p>On and on it goes.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This is the same obstinate attitude that led to the cringey display Kenney offered us in a press conference earlier this week. It included an appeal — just short of a demand — to Justin Trudeau to advocate more fiercely on behalf of the Keystone XL.</p>  <p>By the feds' own account, Trudeau has attempted to make the case for Keystone XL, and even brought it up in his first phone call with Biden, to the prime minister's credit. But let's reflect on the idea that Trudeau has any special motivation to help Kenney out, here —&nbsp;Kenney, the man who has spent the last three years winning Alberta's heart by drawing blood from Trudeau's.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Hey, maybe Kenney could reach out to some international oil and gas players. The very ones led by the CEOs he <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/kenney-big-oil-ceos-1.5083119"><u>denounced for supporting the carbon tax</u></a> in 2019. Get the head of Royal Dutch Shell on the line. I'm sure he's waiting for Alberta's call.&nbsp;</p>  <h2><strong>Limitless self-aggrandizement</strong></h2>  <p>The thing that continually baffles me about the UCP is its combination of limitless self-aggrandizement coupled with its incredible parochialism. You see this in who the government selects to head its pet projects. You see it in the habit of tripling down on ideologically …</p></span></p></div></div>

				<h4>Abstract</h4><p>
				New SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike glycoprotein have arisen independently at multiple locations and may have functional significance. The combination of mutations in the 501Y.V2 variant first detected in South Africa include the N501Y, K417N, and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we address whether the 501Y.V2 variant could escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by natural infection with earlier variants. We were the first to outgrow two variants of 501Y.V2 from South Africa, designated 501Y.V2.HV001dF and 501Y.V2.HV002. We examined the neutralizing effect of convalescent plasma collected from six adults hospitalized with COVID-19 using a microneutralization assay with live (authentic) virus. Whole genome sequencing of the infecting virus of the plasma donors confirmed the absence of the spike mutations which characterize 501Y.V2. We infected with 501Y.V2.HV001dF and 501Y.V2.HV002 and compared plasma neutralization to first wave virus which contained the D614G mutation but no RBD or NTD mutations. We observed that neutralization of the 501Y.V2 variants was strongly attenuated, with IC50 6 to 200-fold higher relative to first wave virus. The degree of attenuation varied between participants and included a knockout of neutralization activity. This observation indicates that 501Y.V2 may escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by prior natural infection. It raises a concern of potential reduced protection against re-infection and by vaccines designed to target the spike protein of earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><center> <a href="https://www.krisp.org.za/manuscripts/MEDRXIV-2021-250224v1-Sigal.pdf"> <img alt="" src="https://www.krisp.org.za/imagesBIO/pdf2.png"></a></center><h4>Download: <a href="https://www.krisp.org.za/manuscripts/MEDRXIV-2021-250224v1-Sigal.pdf"> Full text paper</a></h4>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">Differential dataflow</a> is a library that lets you write simple dataflow programs and a) then runs them in parallel and b) efficiently updates the outputs when new inputs arrive. Compared to competition like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">spark</a> and <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/">kafka streams</a>, it can handle more complex computations and provides dramatically better throughput and latency while using much less memory.</p>
<p>But I'm only aware of a few companies that use it in production, even though it's been around for 5 years. </p>
<p>Possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's missing some important feature, like persistence? </li>
<li>It's had very little advertising?</li>
<li>The api is too hard to use?</li>
<li>The docs / tutorials are not good enough?</li>
<li>Rust is intimidating?</li>
<li>No company to provide paid support?</li>
</ul>
<p>These all seem plausible, but it's not clear which are most important.</p>
<p>Even more surprising is that noone has copied the ideas into some enterprise friendly java monstrosity - despite the fact that differential dataflow is open source and is explained in depth in many papers and blog posts.</p>
<p>I'm interested because <a href="https://materialize.com/">materialize</a> is expending a huge amount of effort adding a SQL layer on top of differential dataflow. That's all very well for people who like SQL, but I'm curious whether there are also potential users who would have been perfectly happy with javascript/python/R bindings and a good tutorial? There are probably multiple niches to be served here.</p>
<p>If you considered using differential dataflow and decided against, please <a href="mailto:jamie@scattered-thoughts.net">let me know</a> why.</p>
<hr>
<p>I got feedback in the form of ~20 emails and ~100 comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25867693">hn</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7zeb3x/why_isn_t_differential_dataflow_more">lobsters</a>. Thanks to everyone who took the time to reach out - it was very helpful.</p>
<p>(To clarify for many fine but confused commenters - I did not make differential dataflow. I'm just trying to find out what more needs to be done to be useful in that niche.)</p>
<p>Reasons given fell in a few buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never heard of differential dataflow </li>
<li>Want a complete drop-in solution (builtin integrations for various other tools, orchestration, monitoring, support, hosting etc) rather than a choose-your-own-adventure library</li>
<li>Api too difficult / docs not good enough</li>
<li>Want to handle late arriving data</li>
</ol>
<p>Materialize is doing a good job with 1-3 already. </p>
<p>I think differential dataflow actually can handle 4, since it can handle bitemporal timestamps, but this isn't something that has been well tested or advertised. That might be worth experimenting with.</p>
<p>All of the people in group 2 talked about typical data processing tasks, but people in group 3 had a much wider range of tasks including large-scale code analysis and monitoring systems with strong latency/consistency requirements. </p>
<p>Group 3 includes many people who seriously evaluated DD but couldn't get past the hello world stage, but also several people who <em>are</em> using DD because nothing else can handle their requirements, but still complain that the api is difficult to use.</p>
<p>Api complaints included:</p>
<ul>
<li>where is all the state? where do all these map/reduce calls actually end up living?</li>
<li>which operators are internally stateful? how much memory will this use? how can I monitor how much memory each operator is using?</li>
<li>too many single-letter type variables with unhelpfully-named bounds</li>
<li>hard to figure out why various traits (eg Data) are not being satisfied</li>
<li>hard to know what methods are available on a collection because they're all in trait impls with complicated bounds</li>
<li>losing track of column names when everything is a tuple</li>
<li>how to feed live data in - examples all show loading static data from a file</li>
<li>how to get data out, especially how to pull results instead of pushing them</li>
<li>hard to integrate threaded workers with tokio executors</li>
<li>hard to integrate with existing tools in javascript/python/r</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like there is some demand for a DD-like tool that:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a simplified, opinionated api</li>
<li>is easy to call from other languages</li>
<li>is easy to target as a compiler backend</li>
<li>is easy to integrate into other event loops</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a very distinct niche from the kafka/spark/flink niche that materialize is targeting - somewhere along a similar dimension to sqlite vs snowflake.</p>

<p>This is a list of C++ anti-patterns that I have seen in various codes.</p>
<!-- END_TEASER -->

<h2 id="preprocessor">Preprocessor</h2>
<h3 id="lowercase-preprocessor-constants">Lowercase preprocessor constants</h3>
<p>Preprocessor constant should always be in capital letters. Otherwise you will
get the weirdest of bugs that take hours to days to track down. Say there is
some feature that you want to switch on/off during compile time. One way to do
it would be using <code>#ifdef</code> like this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>int</span> <span>make_query</span><span>(</span><span>Query</span> <span>const</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>q</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Do some query stuff here.</span>

<span>#ifdef VERIFY_RESULT</span>
    <span>// Perform some verification.</span>
<span>#endif</span>

    <span>// Some other tasks and return statement.</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>When compiling, you can give the option <code>-DVERIFY_RESULT</code> and the preprocessor
will put in the verification code. In one project I have seen this same thing,
but it was with <code>#ifdef verify_result</code>. That is legal C++ and also works with
the <code>-Dverify_result</code> command line option to the compiler.</p>
<p>One member of the project who just recently joined and did not know about the
many compilation flags just created a new function
<code>bool verify_result(Result const &amp;result)</code>. The compiler did not say that the
name was not in use. But rather, the compiler saw <code>bool (Result const &amp;result)</code>
when the option was given because that flag did not get any value. GCC
complained that it did not expect the <code>(</code> there.</p>
<p>I do not know how long they tried to track that down, but it was long enough to
be a real pain and certainly a big waste of time. This would not have happened
if the preprocessor constants had been uppercase all the time.</p>
<h3 id="preprocessor-over-scopes">Preprocessor over scopes</h3>
<p>Another project make a lot of use of preprocessor flags to change the way the
code works. This in itself is not a problem. However, there are pieces of code
like this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#ifdef FLAG</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>With multiple such flags, I do not see how you can sensible reason about this
code.</p>
<h3 id="including-source-files">Including source files</h3>
<p>This was in one of the header files:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#include</span> <span>"other.cpp"</span><span></span>
</code></pre>


<p>Including source files in header files usually is just wrong. One edge case are
unity builds or template specializations. Said project just did it for no
apparent reason.</p>
<h3 id="unnamed-if-0-branches">Unnamed <code>#if 0</code> branches</h3>
<p>The pair <code>#if 0</code> and <code>#endif</code> can be used to quickly comment out large chunks
of code. Contrary to <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>, they have the advantage that they can be
nested and also serve as a sort of super-comment.</p>
<p>When there are multiple of those blocks around, it becomes a bit hard to
understand why some are enabled and others are not enabled:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#if 0</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#if 1</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#if 0</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Is the middle one the negation of the first one? Is the first and third one
actually the same; do they have to be enabled at the same time?</p>
<p>Here I like it better to introduce some named constant for that. The above
could look like the following:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#ifdef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#ifndef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#ifdef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Then it would be easy to understand what is going on. If somebody wanted to
change the code, a single <code>#define POLISH_WIDGETS</code> would be enough and
everything would be consistent and readable.</p>

<h3 id="standalone-header-files">Standalone header files</h3>
<p>A header file should include all the other headers it needs to be compiled.
Something I have seen a couple times is this here:</p>
<p><code>f.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#pragma once</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Notice that the type <code>MyClass</code> is not defined here. It is defined in this
header, but that is not included in <code>f.hpp</code> at all.</p>
<p>It is defined in <code>myclass.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#pragma once</span>

<span>class</span> <span>MyClass</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span><span>:</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>member</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The implementation of the function <code>f</code> is in <code>f.cpp</code>. <em>There</em> the header for
<code>MyClass</code> is included:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#include</span> <span>"myclass.hpp"</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>"f.hpp"</span><span></span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>member</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>And that actually compiles because the compiler only works on the <code>.cpp</code> files.
And given the ordering of the <code>#include</code> statements, the C++ compiler sees
this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>MyClass</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span><span>:</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>member</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>member</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This will work as long as that header <code>f.hpp</code> is always included after
<code>myclass.hpp</code>. It will start to fail when you use <code>f.hpp</code> somewhere else. There
should be an <code>#include "myclass.hpp"</code> in <code>f.hpp</code>.</p>

<p>The order of the header files in <code>f.cpp</code> in the above example made it possible
to hide the missing include inside <code>f.hpp</code> such that it still compiles. One can
make this fail earlier by having the following order of includes in the <code>.cpp</code>
files:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Own" header file, for <code>X.cpp</code> that would be <code>X.hpp</code>
</li>
<li>Project header files</li>
<li>Third-party library headers</li>
<li>Standard library Headers</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, missing include statements in the header will become directly
apparent. You might find a bug in a third-party library this way.</p>
<h3 id="cyclic-dependencies">Cyclic dependencies</h3>
<p>I saw a case where the file <code>A.hpp</code> provides the classes <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>. The
file <code>B.hpp</code> provided <code>B1</code>. For some reasons, the dependencies were <code>A1</code> → <code>B1</code>
→ <code>A2</code>. That is not directly a cyclic dependency of the types but of the header
files. This was "solved" in the project like this in file <code>A.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>A1</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>

<span>#include</span> <span>"B.hpp"</span><span></span>

<span>class</span> <span>A2</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Sure, that compiled just fine. But again, header <code>B.hpp</code> is not a standalone
header and can only be used in this sandwich. I have resolved this by creating
the files <code>A1.hpp</code> and <code>A2.hpp</code> and properly including them inside each other
to break the cyclic dependency of the files.</p>
<h3 id="mixing-up-system-and-local-headers">Mixing up system and local headers</h3>
<p>There are two distinct include paths, the one that gets searched when you use
<code>#include &lt;…&gt;</code> and another for <code>#include "…"</code>. The former is for system and
third-party library headers that are installed globally. You can add to that
path using <code>-I</code>. The latter is for your project and can be amended with <code>-i</code>.
One should not mix the two and use <code>-I.</code> in order to include the local headers
with <code>#include &lt;…&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>One can argue about the usage of <code>using namespace</code>. In most cases I will not
use it to keep the global namespace somewhat clean. Using
<code>using namespace std;</code> in a <code>.cpp</code> file is okay because the namespace <code>std</code> is
just dumped out in a single compilation unit. I do not have to worry about it
in other files.</p>
<p>It becomes a totally different story once you put that <code>using namespace std;</code>
into a header file. Then every other header or source file that includes it
will have that namespace dumped out. Even other projects using that library
will suffer from the attempt to save some typing of the library programming.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-files-with-same-include-guard">Multiple files with same include guard</h3>
<p>I do not like the <code>#ifndef X</code>, <code>#define X</code>, <code>#endif</code> style include guards
because they are so error prone. They are hard to read but even worse, one can
choose the same include guard twice in a project. One could even have the same
include guard that some other library already has used.</p>
<p>If that is the case, the errors will be painfully subtle. Depending on the
order if inclusion, the last header file will just not be included. Then you
get errors about undefined types and undefined functions and might pull out
your hair before you realize what is going on.</p>
<p><code>#pragma once</code> is a good alternative except if you are working with IBM XL 12.
But that compiler cannot do C++11, so it is not that interesting for me anyway.</p>
<h3 id="include-guards-do-not-match-the-filename">Include guards do not match the filename</h3>
<p>If you have <code>#ifndef FOO_H</code> in <code>bar.h</code>, bad things will happen when you create
another <code>foo.h</code>. Therefore the include guard should always be derived from the
path, or use <code>#pragma once</code>.</p>

<p>Using C functions in C++ might be a reasonable thing to do. If you do that, do
not include <code>X.h</code> but rather <code>cX</code>. So instead of <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> use <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>.
This way the C functions will be properly in the <code>std</code> namespace.</p>
<p>Functions like <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>atoi</code>, <code>fopen</code>, <code>malloc</code>, and a bunch of
others should not be used in C++. There are so much better ways.</p>
<h3 id="include-inside-namespaces">
<code>include</code> inside namespaces</h3>
<p>For reason unknown to me, there are a few includes of standard library headers
inside of namespaces. The only reason I can think of is that writing <code>::std::</code>
instead of <code>std::</code> seemed too much work.</p>
<p>GCC 6.0 has changed the standard headers such that they do not work when you
include them inside a namespace. This way one can catch this anti-pattern.</p>
<h2 id="correctness">Correctness</h2>
<h3 id="null-0-and-nullptr">
<code>NULL</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>nullptr</code>
</h3>
<p>In C++ (and C) there are 64-bit unsigned integer number (<code>uint64_t</code> or
<em>perhaps</em> <code>unsigned long</code>) and pointers (<code>void *</code>). In the machine, they are
exactly the same thing, 64-bit unsigned integer numbers. For the type system,
it still makes a great difference.</p>
<p>Although they are both just numbers to the computer, one should help the
programmers read the source code and write</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint64_t</span> <span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This way, it is clear that one is number-zero and the other is pointer-null.
The preprocessor constant <code>NULL</code> is just <code>0</code> or <code>0u</code>, so the compiler always
sees a plain 0 there. Still it is helpful for the programmer to read. In C++11
there even is <code>nullptr</code> which has the correct type, <code>nullptr_t</code>.</p>
<p>In some code you see horrible things like these:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint64_t</span> <span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<h3 id="casting-pointers-to-integers">Casting pointers to integers</h3>
<p>For some reason in one project, pointers are casted to integers. And they are
converted to a special type of integer that you have to choose as a flag to
<code>configure</code> such that the length of that integer is the exact same as the
pointer length, otherwise the compiler would give you an error.</p>
<p>I still do not understand why one would do this sort of brittle code.</p>
<h3 id="subtle-dependence-on-operator-precedence">Subtle dependence on operator precedence</h3>
<p>What is the value of <code>x</code>?</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint32_t</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>3</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<p>I would read it as $2^3 - 1$ and that is seven. The value actually is four.
When compiling with Clang, it conveniently says this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>precedence.cpp:7:25: warning: operator '&lt;&lt;' has lower precedence than '-'; '-' will be evaluated first</span>
<span>      [-Wshift-op-parentheses]</span>
<span>    uint32_t x = 1 &lt;&lt; 3 - 1;</span>
<span>                   ~~ ~~^~~</span>
<span>precedence.cpp:7:25: note: place parentheses around the '-' expression to silence this warning</span>
<span>    uint32_t x = 1 &lt;&lt; 3 - 1;</span>
<span>                        ^</span>
<span>                      (    )</span>
</code></pre>


<p>What did the original author of that line really mean? Was he aware that the
<code>-</code> operation binds stronger than <code>&lt;&lt;</code>? Can I trust that code without
completely understand where all those magic numbers come from?</p>
<h3 id="not-using-raii">Not …</h3></div></div></div>

<p>There are many reasons to look back at 2020 with a whole range of emotions but I would rather look forward.</p>
<h2 id="graphics"><a aria-label="Permalink to Graphics" title="Permalink to 'Graphics'" href="#graphics">Graphics</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>GIMP</strong> team is now focusing on completing version 3.0. It’s too early to say if it will be out in 2021. But unless everything changes dramatically, we’ll see several more 2.99.x releases at the very least.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, not much new is planned, although there’s a new <em>Paint Select</em> tool being worked on by Thomas Manni. And before you ask: no, it’s not AI-based. It’s also designed to do quick binary selection for now, so not very good for selecting strands of hair and suchlike.</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cPHCrLEpy4Y" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video" loading="lazy"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Admittedly, I avoid talking about <strong>Glimpse</strong> and <strong>Glimpse-NX</strong> much. I have two major reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, every public conversation about the fork of GIMP ends up in someone attacking either the Glimpse or the GIMP team, and that’s unproductive and tiresome. And then the progress isn’t all that interesting so far.</p>
<p>The fork is just rebranding and no new features or UX fixes (unless removing the bell pepper brush is your idea of finally making it right for everyone), and then Glimpse-NX — at least for the public eye — exists only as <a href="https://github.com/glimpse-editor/glimpse-nx-design/issues">UI mockups</a>. They did get Bilal Elmoussaoui (GNOME team) to create <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/bilelmoussaoui/gegl-rs">Rust bindings to GEGL</a> for them last autumn, but that’s all as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>So the current pace of the project is not very impressive (again, as a GIMP contributor, I’m biased) and I’m not sure how much we are going to see in 2021.</p>
<p>That said, I think having a whole new image editor based on GEGL would be lovely. I don’t see why Glimpse-NX couldn’t be that project. A proof-of-concept application that would load an image, apply a filter, and export it back sounds feasible. It’s something one could iterate upon. So maybe that’s how they are going to play it.</p>
<p>The fine folks over at <strong>Krita</strong> posted a <a href="https://krita.org/en/item/krita-in-2020/">2020 report</a> where they listed major challenges they will be facing this year: the completion of resources management rewrite that currently blocks v5.0 release, the port to Apple M1, the launching of a new development fund (akin to that of Blender), and more.</p>
<p>They also <a href="https://krita.org/en/item/krita-4-4-2-released/">have just released version 4.4.2</a> with mesh gradients, mesh transform tool, new gradient editor etc.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>I think it’s safe to say that we might see <strong>MyPaint</strong> 2.0.2 later this year with some new features and quite a few bugfixes. There haven’t been much groundbreaking development since 2.0.1 released in May 2020.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are nice new features available in GitHub forks and not all of them have been turned into pull requests. But some were. E.g. there’s a guy who added a <a href="https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/pull/685">perspective mode</a> with vanishing points and all, and it’s almost ready, although it’s been in the works for almost 5 years now.</p>
<p>The topic of fullscreen <strong>color management implementation in Wayland</strong> is back, and it’s <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/t/wayland-color-management/10804/508">a kinda frustrating story</a>. In a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>people who are now <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/14">working on this</a> (Collabora developers) seem to have little experience with color management but they appear to be motivated to hack on the code;</li>
<li>all the while people who have a crapload of experience with color management have had bad experience discussing this before, do not like the approach by the new team, and don’t seem excited to contribute to this new effort (Graeme’s spec proposal is <a href="https://www.argyllcms.com/waylandcm.xml.txt">still available</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>So we might end up with an implementation that is not suitable for professional work. At this point, there’s no telling what will happen. Personally, I keep an open mind about it, but the quality of conversations is not good in a way that there is no visible action in response to substantiated criticism. And so the conversation isn’t getting anyone any further.</p>
<p>Now that <strong>Inkscape</strong> 1.1 alpha is out for everyone to take for a spin, I’m positive we are not so far from the final release. There is <em>a lot</em> packed into the coming update, see the <a href="https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php?title=Release_notes/1.1">draft of the release notes</a>. I’m really looking forward to whatever they have planned for when 1.1 is out, there is still so much to do!</p>

<p>There will be another 1.5.x release of <strong>Scribus</strong> that has some new PDF importing features and includes a lot of small but refining UI changes, likely before April. Another release should follow later in the year.</p>
<p>They definitely don’t want major UI changes in the main development branch anymore until they release 1.6, and that sounds like wrapping up for the big release to me. Which means it’s only a matter of how many under-the-hood changes still need to happen.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time since I last looked at <strong><a href="https://sigil-ebook.com/">Sigil</a></strong>, mostly because I lost my Nook device some years ago and never got to ordering a replacement. Meanwhile, Sigil got better. Like, <em>really</em> better.</p>
<p>They came up with what seems to be a working solution for dealing with both EPUB2 and EPUB3 in the same application, they updated the UI just enough to be recognizable yet somehow nicer, and then they added some boring yet useful utility features.</p>
<p>I do like where Kevin Hendricks and Doug Massay are taking the project to. Version 1.5.0 will probably be out in the first half of 2021.</p>

<p>Thanks to Aurélien Pierre, the last few releases of <strong>darktable</strong> introduced a more articulated division between scene-referred and display-referred workflows, and it looks like more people are contributing to that effort now. There are also some interesting things going on in pull requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7909">color balance RGB filter</a> working in JzAzBz color space, with built-in gamut checking;</li>
<li>a new <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7669">diffusion module</a> to add or remove lens blur, hazing, blooming etc.;</li>
<li>a new <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7633">chromatic aberrations correction module</a> that sits in the right place of the modules chain and produces less halos than defringe;</li>
<li>there’s also a work-in-progress <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7092">option to correct lens distortions</a> straight from the RAW Exif for camera vendors that write the distortion in there&nbsp;— I think I mentioned that one in one of the last weekly recaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something you can already play with if you build from Git:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new demosaicing method, Ratio Corrected Demosaicing (based on <a href="https://github.com/LuisSR/RCD-Demosaicing">this research</a>), is aimed at reducing pixel overshooting;</li>
<li>color calibration module can now create an ad-hoc internal color profile from a color checker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, the amount of contributions is getting large enough for maybe more than one major release a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are currently <a href="https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/milestone/9">63 bugs that need to be fixed</a> for <strong>RawTherapee</strong> 5.9 to be released. I can’t give you a ETA for it and I’m not sure anybody can. The project is very active, and if you ever came across its fans online, you probably admired how strongly they feel about RT being superior in processing quality and ease of use as compared to some other tools :)</p>

<p>The <strong>Siril</strong> team is planning to release version 0.99.8 soon and then hopefully v1.0. They’ve completely rewritten image conversion, revamped memory management, and added astrometry support (6 catalogs supported currently).</p>

<p>The <strong>Synfig</strong> team is completing the migration from autotools to CMake, and their next step would be to make it possible to build the program with MS Visual Studio. The expectation is that more contributors would join then thanks to a lower threshold. After that, the rendering code really needs attention.</p>
<p>In 2020, <strong>VGC</strong> by Boris Dalstein was “pre-incubated” at the BIC de Montpellier startup incubator and additionally obtained a public grant from CNC-RIAM. This means Boris will be able to hire another developer to work on the project.</p>
<p>The situation with <strong>enve</strong> is… Well, complicated, I guess. In summer 2020, Maurycy Liebner announced that the development is <a href="https://twitter.com/enve2d/status/1290935844610682880">on hold due to health issues</a>. In December, he started pushing some commits to the public repository on GitHub again, not at the old rate though. So it’s unclear if he’s resuming the work.</p>
<p>I think it would help to have some sort of a framework for more people to contribute, even basic things like a roadmap and info for newly arrived developers.</p>

<p>Natron is one of the projects that I find hard to speculate about. The only active developer right now is Ole-André Rodlie, and his most recent work currently lives in <a href="https://github.com/rodlie/Natron">his own GitHub fork</a>. He says he’ll soon start making pull requests to the upstream GitHub project (which, let’s be frank, is a bit like sending PRs to yourself).</p>
<p>There could be a few visual tweaks coming next but unlikely at the scale of a UI redesign that is <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/t/natron-ui-re-design-proposal/18313">being discussed on Pixls</a> since May 2020.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>However, the new website for the project, designed by the same contributor, has good chances to go live soon. How much that will help attracting new developers is hard to say. Probably not much, as projects like Natron really need full-time involvement (which I <a href="https://librearts.org/2018/11/the-demise-of-natron/">discussed at length</a> in 2018, and not much changed since then).</p>
<p>This is a rather sad turn of events, as it leaves us Blender as the only working free/libre node-based compositing solution (unless you count upcoming Olive 0.2 in). Ramen is long gone, and ButtleOFX developers gave up around 2017. And while I love Blender to pieces, the idea that it is the only option is somehow worrying.</p>
<h2 id="3d"><a aria-label="Permalink to 3D" title="Permalink to '3D'" href="#3d">3D</a></h2>
<p>Everything Nodes, new asset browser, Vulkan support in EEVEE, new character animation tools and more — <a href="https://www.blender.org/press/big-blender-projects-for-2021/">all work planned</a> for <strong>Blender</strong> in 2021 sounds great. There isn’t really much to add here, apart from mentioning that some of these things will be possible thanks to corporate funding.</p>
<p>Version 2.92 is expected in late February, with features like easily drawing 3D primitives, a whole bunch of sculpting improvements, tracing image sequences to Grease Pencil strokes, cryptomatte support in EEVEE, and so much more.</p>

<p>I’d be a damn fool if I left out <strong>Dust3D</strong>. Jeremy HU did a lot of experimenting in 2020, and this year, his plan is to merge a lot of that into the main program. He’ll do more experimenting with his <a href="https://github.com/huxingyi/autoremesher">quad remesher</a> first though.</p>
<p>One major roadblock is writing his own code instead of CGAL libraries that are license-incompatible with Dust3D (GPL in CGAL vs MIT in Dust3D).</p>
<p>But yes, you should generally be looking forward to a new version of the program with better …</p></div></div></div>

<p>It’s hard to stay in touch with friends. The only thing that has <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">worked for me</a> is <strong>scheduled, recurring calendar events</strong>.</p>



<ul><li>Every other Thursday night, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/25/my-wifes-holiday-costume-makeup/">my wife</a> and I hop on a Zoom with <a href="https://anchor.fm/jace-and-critter/">a friend</a> in Portland and chat for an hour or two. </li><li>Every Tuesday, I have a coffee chat scheduled with a former coworker of mine. </li><li>Every Saturday, my mom comes over for dinner.</li><li>Once a month, I catch up with an old friend who moved away.</li></ul>



<p>We remember because our <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/">calendars</a> remind us. We don’t have to think about <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">when we’ll hang out again</a>. There’s no <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">awkward</a> “we should do this again!” or “let me know when you’re available for lunch next week!” involved. <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/07/a-simple-process-beats-a-perfect-process/">It’s automatic</a>. I schedule it once and we are guaranteed to stay in touch.</p>



<p>If you’re thinking it’s weird to treat a friendship like a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/20/a-tiny-guide-to-sprint-planning-in-scrum/">sprint planning</a> meeting, then maybe you’re right. But it works. It’s worth a little weirdness to stay in touch with the people who matter to me. </p>

        <p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has completed a regulation permitting low volume motor vehicle manufacturers to begin selling replica cars that resemble vehicles produced at least 25 years ago. Congress enacted a DeLorean Motor Company-backed bill backed by the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) DeLorean Motor Company, and others into law in 2015, which streamlined requirements for small automakers, but implementation was delayed while awaiting the NHTSA regulations. Companies like DeLorean will now be able to apply for authorization to produce and sell vehicles under this program.</p>
<p>The recent release of the final rule document was unexpected, and we’re very pleased to see it finally happen. Still, four years overdue with no clear idea of when (or if!) these would ever be released did certainly keep us from putting too many eggs in that stainless steel basket, so to speak.</p>
<p>Some previous suppliers that we had lined up have gone out of business during the pandemic, others have been absorbed by larger companies that have made it clear low volume component production is not something they’re interested in pursuing. In that regard there will be a fair amount of work to be re-done. Perhaps worse, some “champions” we had at various suppliers have retired or moved on. In some cases this has left a void, where before there was a DeLorean fan, who rallied for us within their company and management.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain staffing candidates that were on our short-list have long since moved on in and while unemployment has increased during 2020, many of the specialized roles that we require are still hard to fill.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, in 2015 our planned engine had a life-cycle of emissions compliance through 2022. We had hoped to get into production by 2017 and get 3-4 years out of it before having to take on the engineering for a new powertrain. It’s believed that this engine has been extended through perhaps 2024 now, but it doesn’t seem like a good idea to plan around an engine so near its end-of-life.</p>
<p>That said, with EV’s becoming more mainstream, we’ve been considering switching to an all-electric as the future. It certainly makes for an easier path through emissions maze which still looms large over any internal combustion engine. While an electric Cobra or Morgan may be a little extreme for their potential market, we’ve already seen that an EV DeLorean – as we displayed at the 2012 New York International Auto Show – is not such an “out there” idea.</p>
<p>Most critically, financial markets have changed, and will change even more as the world navigates the continuing COVID crisis during the Biden administration. Will the financial support that we had lined up a few years ago to carry us through the final development and into production still be available?</p>
<p>As the automotive brand with likely the highest name recognition across all demographics in spite of not having a new product in 40 years, we still believe that none of the above is insurmountable and believe that others will see value in it, as well.</p>
<p>Stay tuned…</p>

Introduction
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1">
<p>This will be a short example-based guide to (a) awk (b) gnuplot and (c) using
them in a script.</p>
<p>
I needed to graph some data based on the output of a command run a couple times.
So what better way to solve that five minute task than to spend an hour learning
awk &amp; gnuplot to automate it?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2">
<h2 id="headline-2">
The Problem
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2">
<p>I needed to compare how long a program says it takes with how long it <em>actually</em>
takes to execute. So I wanted to run it a couple times and produce a graph
of real vs reported times.</p>
<p>
To do this, we could use the <code>time</code> command to retrieve its 'real' time. My program
already prints (to stdout) the time it says it takes to complete. The output looks like
"Time = x", where x is some decimal number. I'll describe the <code>time</code> output later.
The final table that I want the script to produce should look something like this
(these are just random numbers):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Trial</th>
<th>Real Time</th>
<th>Printed Time</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>44</td>
<td>5</td>

<tr>
<td>3</td>

Awk

<div id="outline-text-headline-3">
<div id="outline-container-headline-4">
<h3 id="headline-4">
Awk 101
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4">
<p>A good introduction is <a href="https://ferd.ca/awk-in-20-minutes.html">Awk in 20 minutes</a>, I'd recommend skimming through it.</p>
<p>
Awk is a text-processing language that revolves around <em>patterns</em> and <em>actions</em>.
Patterns are like regular expressions (e.g. <code>hello</code>, or <code>hello+</code> if you want one
or more 'o' characters), actions are just a list of statements (e.g. <code>{ print 1; }</code>).
All patterns are checked against every line, and there corresponding action
will be executed if there is a match.</p>
<p>
Here's an example of using awk to print 1 if some line of the input contains hello:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">echo hello | awk <span>'/hello/ {print 1;}'</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Note on zsh's time
</h3>
<p>I use zsh's <code>time</code> which has a slightly different format to bash. Also, both output
to stderr so you'll notice <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> which redirects stderr to stdout.</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Building The Table With Awk
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6">
<p>We're going to need variables, like an index to a for loop, to print
the 'trial number'. No problem, we can initialize one with the <code>-v</code>
option like so <code>awk -v j=1 [script]</code> (set j to 1).</p>
<p>
We can also ask awk to give us the nth word in the current line with
<code>$n</code>, where n is some integer.</p>
<p>
And that's basically all we need! Here is the script:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># "Time" will appear before "java" in my output (e.g. "Time ...\n java ...\n Time ...\n ...").</span>
<span># Also, substr used to remove the 's' character from time's output</span>
awk -v j<span>=</span><span>1</span> <span>'/Time/{printf("%d %s ", j++, $3)} /java/{printf("%s\n", substr($5, 1, length($5)-1))}'</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>I shall elaborate a little more.
My program could be run like <code>time ./java arg1 arg2 2&gt;&amp;1</code> which would produce 2 lines
of output, the first containing "Time = [integer]", the second containing the output
of <code>time</code>. So my awk script will either see "Time", where it will
print the index and integer, or it will print the real time after seeing "java".
Notice that I don't print a newline with the "Time" action (which will come first
in my output). So I can build a row from data that spans multiple lines (2 lines in
this case.) Also, my output doesn't have any lines that contain both "Time" and "java".</p>
<p>
When my program is run five times and the output is piped to that awk command, it produces

<div id="outline-text-headline-7">
<p>To plot our data, we could have two lines. One would use the second column for the y-axis, and the other
would use the third. Both use the first column (the trial number) for their x-axis<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>
To tell gnuplot to use two columns: <code>using 1:2</code> or <code>u 1:2</code> specifies column 1 to be on the x-axis
and column 2 on y. To plot one line, you'd use <code>p "data.dat" u 1:2 title "My Plot" w lp</code> (<code>w lp</code> means
make it a line plot), but we want two lines, and also to use this without gnuplot's interactive mode, so
here's the full command:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># data.dat is my file name, convention seems to end it with *.dat.</span>
SETUP_OUTPUT<span>=</span><span>"set terminal png size 500,500; set output 'blogplot.png';"</span>
PLOT_DATA<span>=</span><span>"p 'data.dat' u 1:2 title 'Real Time' w lp, 'data.dat' u 1:3 title 'Printed Time' w lp"</span>
gnuplot -e <span>"</span>$SETUP_OUTPUT<span> </span>$PLOT_DATA<span>"</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Which outputs to a png called <code>blogplot.png</code> when executed:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Apache Superset is an open source enterprise-ready data exploration, data visualization and dashboarding application that enables teams to be productive with data.</em></p><p>Today our community is proud to announce the release of <strong>Apache Superset 1.0</strong>, a major milestone that we’ve been working towards since the very first commit at a hackathon at Airbnb back in 2015. Superset 1.0 packs a lot of new features, uplevels usability, holds a higher quality standard, and raises the bar for releases to come. This post details the key advancements that our community has been building up towards this release.</p><p>While growing fast over the past four years, Superset had accumulated a certain amount of technical debt, design debt, bugs, and idiosyncrasies. For this release, we wanted to pay the bulk of that debt off, <strong>streamlining the core user flows</strong>, refreshing the overall look and feel, taking off some of the scaffolding that was left standing around, and more generally, leveling up the user experience.</p><p>Visually, Superset 1.0 is <strong>stunning</strong>, introducing <strong>card layouts</strong> with <strong>thumbnails</strong> throughout the application, streamlining <strong>navigation</strong> and <strong>content discovery</strong> with a new home page, redesigned menus, and generally enriching existing pages.</p><p><span><span>

    </span></span></p><p>For engineers and hackers, we’ve made Superset much more <strong>modular, extensible </strong>and<strong> integratable</strong>. We’re now exposing the building blocks of Superset for engineers to extend or use in other projects. It’s now easier than ever to create new <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-07-02-hello-world/">visualization plugins</a> for Superset and to share those plugins back with the community. We’re excited by the possibilities that this opens and excited to  observe a growing ecosystem of plugins take life.  We’ve also <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-10-01-superset-api/">formalized a public REST API</a> that enables engineers to essentially do everything that users can do in Superset, programmatically.</p><p><span><span>

    </span></span></p><p>Superset is now more <strong>secure</strong> than ever before. <a href="https://preset.io/">Preset</a> commissioned penetration testing on the product and led the charge to fix all discovered vulnerabilities and set up automation mechanisms to prevent regression. We’ve also committed to doing regular pentesting audits to ensure that we catch issues. We’ve refined our processes around resolving security issues while pushing through a handful of well-handled CVEs (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a>) over the past year. Also important, we’ve <strong>simplified the security model</strong> in Superset to a simpler set of atomic permissions to make it more comprehensive.</p><p>Because we wanted to make it easier for people to manage and share the objects they’re building in Superset, we’ve rebuilt the <strong>export/import </strong>functionality from the ground up. This allows organizations to manage and synchronize objects across environments, and for users to share the assets that they’ve built easily.</p><p>We’ve also completely redesigned our <strong>community website </strong> at <a href="https://superset.apache.org/">superset.apache.org</a> and made it the official hub for our fast growing community. All of the resources expected from a mature open source community can be found and contributed to there.</p><p><strong>Reporting</strong> and <strong>alerting</strong> has always been highly requested in the community, and 1.0 packs a solid implementation that can support most use cases. This enables periodic email delivery of reports, as well as an alerting system that can monitor your metrics arbitrary shifts and alert you as specified. We built an extensible system that we can expand to more delivery mechanisms and forecasting/alerting logic.</p><p><span><span>

    </span></span></p><p>Around the topic of<strong> open source governance</strong>, Superset <strong>graduated</strong> from the incubator to become a top-level project at the <strong>Apache Software Foundation</strong>. As a project that had been incubating since 2016, we finally ironed out some minor licensing issues, prevented license-related regressions using <a href="https://fossa.com/">FOSSA</a>, and started publishing proper ASF releases on a regular cadence. We also actively worked towards fitting the <a href="https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html">Apache Project Maturity Model</a>, aligning with the governance model prescribed by the ASF and took action to grow the community in sustainable ways. The graduation formally recognizes that the community has complied with all the requirements, and operates at the high standard required by the ASF.</p><p>With 1680 PRs merged and 25+ <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asip">SIPs</a> (Superset Improvement Proposals) over 2020, it’s hard to summarize what went into this release. Improvements happened in all aspects of the project, from infrastructure to design, through backend and frontend, to community and governance. Here are some <strong>honorable mentions</strong> that we haven’t been covered above, but deserve a mention in this post:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11499">Asynchronous backend improvements</a></li><li>Metadata and data pane in explorer view</li><li>Toolbars redesign (SQL Lab, dashboard, explore)</li><li>Date range picker redesign</li><li>Various Docker / Helm improvements</li><li>Migration of key visualization to plugins using <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/">Echarts</a></li><li>Time series forecasting leveraging the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">Prophet</a> library</li><li>Improvements to and extensive use of our feature flag framework</li><li>Improved analytics logging, capturing more events more consistently</li><li>Exploration control panels improvements</li><li>Improved SQL-to-explore flows</li></ul><p>All-in-all, Superset has come a long way recently and this release marks the project entering its mature stage. The community has gained velocity and momentum, and yet we’re still accelerating. 1.0 marks a huge milestone in our journey to delight data teams with the most comprehensive and modern analytics platform there is, but clearly this is still the beginning of a much greater adventure.</p><p>Congratulations to all contributors and to sponsoring organizations, this is a huge achievement!</p><p><a href="https://superset.apache.org/">Join our community!

<p>In this tutorial, we'll build a steganography tool in Python. Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other data. Unlike encryption, where the goal is to secure <em>the contents</em> of communication between two parties, steganography aims to obscure the fact that the parties are communicating at all.</p>
<p>Our tool will enable the user to hide secret text within a normal-looking <code>.png</code> image file. The receiver of the image will use the same tool to reveal the hidden message.</p>
<p>We'll use Python to build the tool. The most popular Python image processing libraries are <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/">Pillow</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/">OpenCV</a>, but these are heavy libraries with many dependencies. We'll avoid these and instead use the lightweight <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pypng/">PyPNG</a> library which is written in pure Python, and therefore easier to run on various platforms.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-background-on-steganography">A quick background on steganography</h2>
<p>Let's imagine three people: Alice, Bob and Eve. Alice wants to send a private message to Bob, while Eve wants to intercept this message. While modern-day encryption can help Alice and Bob ensure that Eve doesn't know the <em>contents</em> of their message, Eve can possibly still deduce interesting information just from knowing that Alice and Bob are communicating at all, and how frequently they communicate.</p>
<p>To obscure the communication channel completely, Alice and Bob can exploit the fact that hundreds of millions of photos are uploaded and shared across the internet daily. Instead of communicating directly, Alice can leave her message hidden in an image at a pre-agreed location and Bob can access this message. From Eve's perspective, there is now no direct communication between the two.</p>
<p>A single image is made up of millions of pixels. While many formats exist, a pixel is most simply represented by a group of three numbers between 0 and 255, one number each for the red, blue, and green values of that pixel. Using this Red-Green-Blue scheme we can represent any colour in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB color model</a>.</p>
<p>Digital text, like images, is also represented internally by numbers, so the differences between a text file and an image file are not as large as you might assume. Any digital data can be represented as a <a href="https://thehelloworldprogram.com/computer-science/what-is-binary/">binary string</a>, a bunch of 1s and 0s, and we can make tiny modifications to an image to encode a binary string within it. As an example, consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>image = [, , ]</code></pre>
<p>This is a representation of an image with three pixels: one red, one green, and one blue. If we encode this as an image and open it in an image viewer, we'll see the three pixel image, but if we read this data with Python, it is simply a list of tuples, each containing three integers.</p>
<p>We could also look at each value making up each pixel and calculate whether it is <em>odd</em> or <em>even</em>. We could encode odd numbers as <code>1</code> and even values as <code>0</code>. This would give us the binary string "100 010 001" (as the 255 values are odd and the 0s are even).</p>
<p>If we made a small modification to the image as follows:</p>
<pre><code>image = [, , ]</code></pre>
<p>The image would look almost identical in any image viewer (we have just added or subtracted a minuscule amount of color from some values), but the binary string -- using our odd/even method -- would look completely different: "011 111 100". </p>
<p>Using this technique but extending it over an entire image (millions of pixels), we can hide a large amount of text data in any image.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-project-on-replit">Creating the project on Repl.it</h2>
<p>If you were serious about keeping your messages as secret as possible, you'd want to do all of these steps on an offline computer that you fully control. As a learning exercise though, we'll set the project up on <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>. Navigate to their site and sign up for an account if you don't have one.</p>
<p>Create a new project, choosing "Python" as the language, and give your project a name.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.repl.it/images/tutorials/13-steganography/04-create-repl.png" alt="Creating a new repl"></p>
<p>The first piece we need to build is a function to encode any text message as a binary string.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-a-text-message-as-a-binary-string">Encoding a text message as a binary string</h2>
<p>Open the <code>main.py</code> file and add the following code</p>
<pre><code>import base64

def encode_message_as_bytestring(<span>message</span>):
    b64 = <span>message</span>.encode(<span>"utf8"</span>)
    bytes_ = base64.encodebytes(b64)
    bytestring = <span>""</span>.jo<span>in(</span>[<span>"{:08b}"</span>.<span>format</span>(<span>x</span>) for <span>x</span> <span>in</span> bytes_])
    <span>return</span> bytestring</code></pre>
<p>This first encodes our text as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a> and then as a binary string. You can add some print statements to see how the message is transformed in the different steps, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.repl.it/images/tutorials/13-steganography/13-01-encode-binstring.png" alt="Encoding a message as a binary string"></p>
<p>The base64 step is not strictly necessary, but it is useful as any file or data can be encoded as base64. This opens our project up to future extensions such as hiding other kinds of files within image files instead of just text strings.</p>
<h2 id="adding-an-end-of-message-delimeter">Adding an 'end of message' delimeter</h2>
<p>We'll assume that our message will always 'fit' in our image. We can fit three binary digits per pixel (one for each of the RGB values), so our resulting binary string should be shorter than the the number of pixels in the image multiplied by three.</p>
<p>We'll also need to know when the message <em>ends</em>. The message will only be encoded in the beginning of the image file, but if we don't know how long the message is, we'll keep looking at normal pixels and trying to encode them as text data. Let's add an "end of string" delimiter to the end of our message: this should be something that wouldn't appear half way through our actual message by chance. We'll use the binary representation of '!ENDOFMESSAGE!' for this.</p>
<p>Modify your function to look as follows, which adds this delimeter at the end.</p>
<pre><code>import <span>base64
</span>
ENDOFMESSAGE = <span>"0100100101010101010101100100111101010010010001010011100101000111010101000101010101010110010101000101010100110000010001100100100001010010010100110100010100111101"</span>

def encode_message_as_bytestring(message):
    <span>b64 </span>= message.encode(<span>"utf8"</span>)
    <span>bytes_ </span>= <span>base64.encodebytes(b64)
</span>    <span>bytestring </span>= <span>""</span>.<span>join(["{:08b}".format(x) </span>for x in <span>bytes_])
</span>    <span>bytestring </span>+= ENDOFMESSAGE
    return <span>bytestring</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we can handle some basic text encoding, let's look at images.</p>
<h2 id="getting-pixels-from-an-image">Getting pixels from an image</h2>
<p>Find a PNG image somewhere - either one you've taken yourself or from a site like unsplash. You can use any online JPG to PNG converter if you only have <code>.jpg</code> files available.</p>
<p>Upload your PNG file by clicking on the three dot menu in the repl sidebar, in the top right corner of the files pane to the left, and selecting <code>upload file</code> or by simply dragging and dropping your file within the files pane.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.repl.it/images/tutorials/13-steganography/05-upload-file.png" alt="Image showing file upload"></p>
<p>We're going to write a function that extracts the raw pixel data from this image file. Add an import to the top of the file.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> png</code></pre>
<p>And then add a new function to the bottom of <code>main.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_pixels_from_image</span><span>(fname)</span></span>:
    img = png.Reader(fname).read()
    pixels = img[<span>2</span>]
    <span>return</span> pixels</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read()</code> method returns a 4‑tuple consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>width: Width of PNG image in pixels</li>
<li>height: Height of PNG image in pixels</li>
<li>rows: A sequence or iterator for the row data</li>
<li>info: An info dictionary containing some meta data</li>
</ul>
<p>We are primarily interested in the third item, "rows", which is an iterator containing all the pixels of the image, row by row. If you're not familiar with Python generators take a look at <a href="https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/">this guide</a>, but they are essentially memory-efficient lists.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-the-image-with-the-message">Encoding the image with the message</h2>
<p>Now that we have the encoded message and pixels of the image ready we can combine them to form our secret encoded image.</p>
<p>Add the following function to the bottom of the <code>main.py</code> file. This function takes in the outputs from the previous functions (our raw pixels and our message encoded as a binary string), and combines them.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>encode_pixels_with_message</span>(<span>pixels, bytestring</span>):</span>
    <span>'''modifies pixels to encode the contents from bytestring'''</span>

    enc_pixels = []
    string_i = <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> row <span>in</span> pixels:
        enc_row = []
        <span>for</span> i, char <span>in</span> <span>enumerate</span>(row):
            <span>if</span> string_i &gt;= <span>len</span>(bytestring):
                pixel = row[i]
            <span>else</span>:
                <span>if</span> row[i] % <span>2</span> != <span>int</span>(bytestring[string_i]):
                    <span>if</span> row[i] == <span>0</span>:
                        pixel = <span>1</span>
                    <span>else</span>:
                        pixel = row[i] - <span>1</span>
                <span>else</span>:
                    pixel = row[i]
            enc_row.append(pixel)
            string_i += <span>1</span>

        enc_pixels.append(enc_row)
    <span>return</span> enc_pixels</code></pre>
<p>This is the most complicated part of our project, but most of the code is there to handle edge cases. The important insight is that we want to control whether each pixel has an odd value (representing a 1 in our binary string) or an even one (to represent a 0). By chance, half of the pixel values will already have the correct value.</p>
<p>We simply loop through the binary string and the pixel and 'bump' each value that isn't correct by one. That is, we subtract 1 from the value if we need to change it from odd to even or vice versa. We don't want any negative numbers, so if we need to change any of the <code>0</code> values, we add 1 instead.</p>
<h3 id="writing-our-modified-pixels-back-to-an-image">Writing our modified pixels back to an image</h3>
<p>We now have all the image data, including the encoded message but it is still just a list of pixels. Let's add a function that will compile our pixels back into a PNG image.</p>
<p>Add the following function to the bottom of the <code>main.py</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>def write<span>_pixels_to_image(<span>pixels</span>, <span>fname</span>)</span>:
    png.from<span>_array(<span>pixels</span>, 'RGB')</span>.save(fname)</code></pre>
<p>The above function takes the array <code>pixels</code> and uses the <code>png</code> module to write these to a brand new <code>.png</code> file.</p>
<p>Play around with these functions to make sure you understand how they work. Before we write some wrapper code to actually use these, we're going to do everything backwards so that we can also extract hidden messages from previously encoded PNG files.</p>
<h2 id="decoding-messages-from-image-files">Decoding messages from image files</h2>
<p>First we need a function that can turn a binary string back into readable text. As before, we'll go via base64 for better compatability. Add the following function to the bottom of the <code>main.py</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>def decode<span>_message_from_bytestring(<span>bytestring</span>)</span>:
    bytestring = bytestring.split(ENDOFMESSAGE)<span>[<span>0</span>]</span>
    message = <span>int</span>(bytestring, <span>2</span>).<span>to</span><span>_bytes(<span>len</span>(<span>bytestring</span>)</span> 
    message = base64.decodebytes(message).decode(<span>"utf8"</span>)
    return message</code></pre>
<p>Remember how we added a special <code>E…</code></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h4>Introduction</h4><p>Escrow is a payment setup where the payer sends funds to a third party rather than directly to the payee. If certain conditions are met, the third party routes the funds to the recipient; if not, the funds get returned to the sender. Escrow is particularly useful for high value payments because the payer is guaranteed their money back if the payee doesn’t meet the conditions.</p><p>Many Americans encounter escrow when they buy or sell a home. In the US, the final step in buying a home is referred to as the “closing process.” While it can vary from state to state, the basic premise is that the buyer delivers the funds to a third party, the seller signs over the deed (or title) to the property, and that third party then transfers the funds to the seller once all the documents are complete. The third party is often referred to as a “title and escrow agent.”</p><p>This post takes the sale of a residential home and walks through how to build the flow of funds associated with the escrow process. We hope this guide is useful in demystifying how an escrow company might automate its payment operations using Modern Treasury.</p><h4>The User Experience</h4><p>Let’s say you’re building a title and escrow company in the US that helps clients sell their homes online. The user experience steps might look something like this:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Billie Buyer commits to buying a house. Billie will make a 20% down payment in cash and will take out a mortgage for the remaining 80%. </li><li>You assign an escrow bank account to the transaction, collect the two incoming wire transfers from Billie Buyer and the lender, and inform the seller when the funds are in your possession.</li><li>At that point, Sandy Seller signs over the property.</li><li>Once you’ve determined all the documentation is completed correctly, you disburse the full purchase amount to Sandy Seller via wire transfer. </li></ol><p>The flow of funds is straightforward: two incoming wire transfers, and one outgoing wire transfer. This can get significantly more complicated if there are multiple sources of funds, or if there are other parties to be paid, such as tax authorities or other settlement agents. But for the sake of clarity, we’ll start with this simple scenario.</p><h4>Payment Ops Architecture<br></h4><p>To start, you should decide on the account structure itself. Escrow accounts have specific legal designations at banks and not all banks offer them. In addition, you should decide whether to use a single bank account for multiple transactions or to use virtual accounts.<br></p><p><a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/docs/virtual-accounts" target="_blank">Virtual accounts</a> are accounts with unique account numbers within a physical bank account. They are much faster to provision than real bank accounts and guarantee one-to-one reconciliation. For our architecture, using virtual accounts as escrow accounts is ideal because we can create one account per house sale. This helps us segregate funds in our reconciliation, as opposed to mixing the funds of multiple house sales in a single account. Also, single transactions per virtual account create a more manageable audit trail.<br></p><figure id="w-node-18dd9f1739d7-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/6009051bee1c4e7860a4289f_Escrow%20Journal%20Post%20Diagram.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><h4>API Calls and Timings</h4><p>With our payment ops architecture in hand, we’re ready to build. <br></p><h5>Step 1: Assign a Virtual Account to a sale and share numbers with Buyer and Lender</h5><p>As soon as you learn of an impending house sale, you create a virtual account and share its details with Billie Buyer. You might also generate an invoice for Billie Buyer to share with their mortgage lender, along with specific instructions as to the amount and breakdown to be included in the wires.<br></p><p>To do so, you’d make an Modern Treasury API request like the following:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br> &nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br> &nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/virtual_accounts \<br> &nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br> &nbsp;-d '{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Sale of 123 Main Street",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"internal_account_id": "c743edb7-4059-496a-94b8-06fc081156fd",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"account_details": [<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"account_number": "2000001",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"account_number_type": "other"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br> &nbsp;}'</h6><p><em>‍</em>The response includes the unique routing details for the newly created account. &nbsp;You might also want to add additional information about the sale in the account’s metadata, for example: details about the buyer, seller, property in question, expected close date, any unique arrangements, and other information.</p><h5>Step 2: Create Expected Payments to monitor the wires you expect to receive<br></h5><p>Though not required, it’s useful to create Expected Payments for the two incoming wires you expect to receive. This way, Modern Treasury will notify your system via webhook whether a given payment succeeds within your specified time range, or if it is overdue:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br> &nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br> &nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/expected_payments \<br> &nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br> &nbsp;-d '{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"description": "Sale of 123 Main Street (Billie’s Portion)",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"internal_account_id": "c743edb7-4059-496a-94b8-06fc081156fd",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"virtual_account_id": "virtual-account-id",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"amount_upper_bound": 6000000,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"amount_lower_bound": 6000000,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"date_upper_bound": "2021-01-15"<br> &nbsp;}'</h6><p><em>‍</em>Some banks will notify you in advance of a payment settling in an account. Modern Treasury captures that notification in the form of an Incoming Payment Detail object. Subscribing to Incoming Payment Detail <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#incoming-payment-details" target="_blank">webhooks</a> will be the first indication from the bank that the wires will settle soon.</p><h5>Step 3: Disburse funds </h5><p>Once the funds have arrived and the documents have been signed, you can disburse the total amount due to Sandy Seller. Let’s say Sandy Seller is getting $300,000 in net proceeds, which will go out via a single wire. Note that the amount is in cents, not dollars, so it is presented as 30000000:</p><h6>‍<br>curl --request POST \<br> &nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br> &nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/payment_orders \<br> &nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br> &nbsp;-d '{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"description": "Sale of 123 Main Street (Sandy’s Payout)",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"type": "wire",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"amount": 30000000,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"currency": "USD",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"originating_account": "virtual-account-id",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"receiving_account_id": "sandy-external-account-id",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"counterparty_id": "sandy-counterparty-id"<br> &nbsp;}'</h6><p><em>‍</em>Once the payment goes through, the account will be debited $300,000 and the transaction will be complete.</p><p>Lastly, you want to add <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#metadata" target="_blank">metadata</a> to the payment for future reference. In addition to metadata tags (eg. key value pairs such as Type: Residential or State: Colorado) you might also attach the PDF for the legal docs, or the CSV calculating the amounts. This will be useful for finance teams that might have questions about this payment in the future.</p><p>That’s it. You have just built a sophisticated payment ops architecture for a house sale with a few API calls.</p><div><p>In reality, of course, things can be more elaborate. Billie Buyer could have multiple sources of funds for the down payment, as they may be receiving funds from family or from a service like <a href="http://haus.com/" target="_blank">Haus</a>. They may also be working with multiple lenders if they have a second mortgage. And depending on the state and county the house is located in, the escrow company may have to disburse funds for sales tax or other fees.</p></div><h4>What Can Go Wrong?</h4><p>Payment operations software, such as <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/" target="_blank">Modern Treasury</a>, can manage not only the happy path as described above but also edge cases when things go wrong. A common issue could be that a seller could mistype their bank account details, causing the payment to be returned. Modern Treasury supports account verification with providers like <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/docs/plaid-integration-guide" target="_blank">Plaid</a>, so both you and the seller can be confident that funds are routed to the right destination.</p><p>Customer service issues are another type of problem that can arise, such as when a lender sends the incorrect amount. In that case, there might be an additional transaction necessary or an explanatory note for future audits. Modern Treasury supports tracking funds using double-entry <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/docs/ledgers-overview" target="_blank">Ledgers</a>. This way, ops teams can refer to an immutable history of the transaction data, since all money movements are captured and displayed. In the future, accountants and auditors won’t be left wondering about a wire, since contextual information will be tied to the bank statement transaction in question.<br></p><h4>More?</h4><p>This post laid out a simple yet robust foundation for payment ops at an escrow company, leaving plenty of room for future functionality. </p><p>For any specific questions, or to see how Modern Treasury can help make your company’s payment ops simple, scalable, and secure, <a href="https://app.moderntreasury.com/sign_up" target="_blank">sign up today</a>.<br><em>Note: Modern Treasury empowers teams to make payment operations simple, scalable, and secure.

<h3>Piracy in the pandemic</h3>



<p>The pandemic may have stopped many from going to the cinema, but that doesn’t mean people didn’t watch films in 2020. Whether through streaming services like Netflix or old-fashioned TV channels and DVDs, there are still many ways to enjoy films at home.</p>



<p>And, of course, there’s always piracy.</p>



<p>According to London-based company Muso, which tracks copyright infringement in 196 countries, visits to sites hosting pirated streams of films increased <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6347345/Has%20the%20displaced%20cinema%20audience%20become%20the%20new%20piracy%20audience.pdf?utm_campaign=COVID-19%20Protect%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=89190861&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fsAlLpaO7ia-oGXZtShQz3YvarSVxz-MOcRsd6n-2MdwgaqkuJst2pleQF6wqtV2M9iKJJrEHjfzWrF6zIi64vzWBy6G_Y04I0aTFZKM8_SzKuys&amp;utm_content=89190861&amp;utm_source=hs_automation">as much as 90%</a> in some countries during the first few months of the pandemic. The company provided<em> Rest of World</em> with its list of the top 50 foreign films accessed via illegal streaming sites from January to October last year.</p>



<p>Predictably, many of the films are from the last two years. One notable exception? “The Flu,” a 2013 film about a lethal, airborne virus that infects a South Korean city. But which films made the top ten?</p>

<p><strong>From:</strong> Russia<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 12/19/2019</p>

</p></figure>



<p>An ordinary girl becomes the object of study after she gains superpowers from exposure to extraterrestrial technology in this film from Russian director Fyodor Bondarchuk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Invasion” picks up where the 2017 film “Attraction” left off, after an alien ship has crash-landed in a Russian city. Exposed to alien technology, Julia is brought into a secret government lab to be studied. After gaining superpowers that threaten not only humans but also extraterrestrial life, Julia has to decide which side she is on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the film has not been widely reviewed in Western media outlets, the entertainment website <a href="https://www.eclecticpop.com/2020/12/movie-review-does-attraction-2-invasion-vtorzhenie-satisfy-as-a-sequel.html">Eclectic Pop</a> noted that “the sequel avoids the mind-numbing quality of its genre peers to provide something captivating,” providing a worthy sequel to its predecessor. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8060328/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$15.9 million</a> worldwide.</p>



<h2 id="baaghi-3">Baaghi 3</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In this 2020 Indian action thriller directed by Ahmed Khan, the third in a series of loosely related films, a man with chiseled abs saves his elder brother from Syrian terrorists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ronnie’s rescue mission is a display of punches, explosions, and acrobatics, often shown in slow motion, “but none of it can rise beyond a weak script that doesn’t go for the kill,” the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/baaghi-3/movie-review/74503018.cms"><em>Times of India </em>wrote</a>. Ronnie, played by Indian actor Tiger Shroff, beats up men, cars, tanks, and helicopters, mostly shirtless. “He bounces off buildings, treads on air; delivers triple roundhouse kicks and does devastating stuff with his hands and feet,” the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/baaghi-3-movie-review-tiger-shroff-saves-syria-but-not-sanity/story-wrmhhjpvtV40GFYOsZCsUI.html"><em>Hindustan Times </em>wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the film attempts to reach beyond Bollywood cliches, one trope remains: demonizing Muslims as villains. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8366590/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$16.7 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="sputnik">Sputnik</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Russia<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Drama<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 9/10/2020</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Two Russian cosmonauts return to Earth from a research mission in 1983, but their spacecraft malfunctions on the way home. Only one crew member, Konstantin Sergeyevich, survives. But he is not alone. Konstantin’s body houses a slimy, spindly creature that is dormant during the day, in his stomach. At night, it climbs out of his body in search of human flesh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reviewer Matt Zoller Seitz says a “very Russian vibe of <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sputnik-movie-review-2020">soulful heaviness</a>” sets the film apart. Rather than give up his dream of space travel, Konstantin, whose spouse passed away before the journey, put his son in an orphanage. When he returns to Earth, Konstantin must confront his responsibility. Though “Sputnik” is about an alien, it focuses heavily on humans: how and where our weak points are, how we can be manipulated, and how our biology can fail us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Released in the middle of a pandemic, “Sputnik” grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt11905962/?ref_=bo_se_r_2">$307,062</a> at the box office worldwide and was shown as part of the <a href="https://tribecafilm.com/films/sputnik-2020">Tribeca Film Festival</a>.</p>



<h2 id="one-piece-stampede">One Piece: Stampede</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Japan<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Animation<br><strong>Release date: </strong>8/9/2019</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s probably no surprise that this anime film is on the list, as it’s based on one of the most popular Japanese manga series of all time: “One Piece,” by Eiichiro Oda. It is the 14th film in the franchise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pirates from around the world gather at a festival where they race to an island containing the legendary lost treasure of Gol D. Roger, king of the pirates. The race quickly unravels into fantasy violence, which the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-10-23/one-piece-stampede-review-anime"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> called “nonstop mayhem” — explosions, fistfights, earthquakes, and naval bombardments dart across the screen with colorful special effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luffy, the protagonist of the series, teams up with his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates. They face off against Bullet, who hopes to make his name as the strongest pirate, the new king, and someone who relies on only himself. Luffy, like all good role models, values friendship and teamwork. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt9430698/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$81.6 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="son-of-a-richnbsp">Son of a Rich&nbsp;</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Here’s a comedic plot for the ages: an oligarch’s pampered son is tricked into believing that he has traveled through time to become a serf in a 19th-century village, in a bid to rehabilitate his appalling behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grigory’s family is so wealthy, he believes that he is above the law. He parties hard, gets into trouble, and scoffs in the face of authority. One day, he goes too far — and so his father, as one does, buys a large tract of land and hires a group of actors to create a 19th-century village. His son gets into an orchestrated fake car accident and wakes up in the village, believing that he’s traveled back through time. Watched by a network of hidden cameras (and a team of psychologists), the oligarch watches his son discard his privileged ways and learn the value of hard work.</p>



<p>Clearly, this relatable tale of redemption struck a chord with people: the Russian comedy directed by Klim Shipenko grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt11418452/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$43.8 million</a> and was one of the most pirated films of the year.</p>



<h2 id="recep-vedik-6">Recep İvedik 6</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Turkey<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Comedy<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 11/7/2019</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Recep, a man with a unibrow and a penchant for slapping people in the face, has misadventures in Kenya, in this Turkish slapstick comedy, directed by Togan Gökbakar.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Recep_%C4%B0vedik_6?id=3sJ0zlYkZME.P&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Recep İvedik</a> is at home watching television, when the mailman delivers him an invitation to a dried beans festival in Turkey’s Konya province. But instead of getting plane tickets to Konya, Recep and his best friend Nurullah end up on a flight to Kenya.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recep and Nurullah join a safari tour. A series of escalating comical escapades ensue, with everything from close encounters with the local wildlife to mediating a dispute between two tribes. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt7399138/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$17 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="peninsula">Peninsula</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> South Korea<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Thriller<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 7/15/2020</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVucSRLLeIM?feature=oembed" title="TRAIN TO BUSAN PRESENTS: PENINSULA (2020) Official Teaser | Zombie Action Movie" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The 2016 zombie thriller “Train to Busan” was met with universal critical acclaim and became one of the films that marked South Korea’s rise as a cinematic power. Peninsula, however, is another example of a sequel that doesn’t live up to the original.</p>



<p>“A sequel was inevitable, and despite some truly white-knuckle car chases and creative lighting, <em>Peninsula,</em> like many films that jump on the surprise hit bandwagon, proves lightning in a bottle happens only once,” the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/peninsula-ban-do-film-review"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a> wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, “Peninsula” shows people trying to escape the zombie-ridden South Korea of the first film. Captain Jung-Seok is unable to get his entire family out safely and, four years later, goes back to the country from the safe harbor of Hong Kong, to attempt to recover $20 million from a food truck. The captain dodges flesh-hungry zombies in their quest to find the money. Peninsula grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8850222/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$39.7 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="miracle-in-cell-no">Miracle in Cell No. 7&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Turkey<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Drama<br><strong>Release date: </strong>10/10/2019</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2wPoBy2JQI?feature=oembed" title="Miracle in Cell No. 7 (Trailer- English subtitles) 2019 #MiracleInCell #Netflix #MiracleInCellNo7" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This Turkish drama, directed by Mehmet Ada Öztekin, is a remake of the 2013 South Korean film of the same name. The story focuses on Memo, a disabled father, and his seven-year-old daughter, Ova. At the film’s <a href="https://www.goldenglobes.com/articles/miracle-cell-no7-turkey">outset</a>, Memo and Ova live with her grandmother, Fatma Ana, in a small Aegean town.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Memo, who works as a shepherd, is sentenced to death after being accused of murdering the garrison commander’s young daughter. He is sent to cell number 7, where he awaits his execution. The prisoners realize that Memo could not have committed the crime. Back home, Fatma Ana passes away. Ova, now alone, sets out on a quest to be reunited with her father.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Miracle in Cell No. 7” was chosen as Turkey’s Oscar nominee for the 93rd Academy Awards and was the <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/arts/cinema/what-makes-turkish-miracle-in-cell-no-7-a-popular-hit">most-watched</a> film in the country in 2019. By the end of the film, viewers are forced to reckon internally with their own perceptions of good and evil — and to take a long look at abuses of power and flaws within the justice system. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt10431500/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$17.2 million</a> at the box office worldwide.</p>



<h2 id="ip-man-4-the">Ip Man 4: The Finale</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Hong Kong<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>12/19/2019</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3LzxNct3eA?feature=oembed" title="IP MAN 4: THE FINALE  Trailer (2019) Donnie Yen Action Movie" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The final film in the saga of Bruce Lee’s martial arts master, “Ip Man 4” turns the lens on racism in the United States. In the film, which grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2076298/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$176 million</a> worldwide, fight scenes are used as a way to turn foreigners’ biases against them.</p>



<p>Mostly set in 1964 San Francisco, the film pits karate against kung fu — in the forms of a racist marine and Ip Man, a master of the Wing Chun school of the Chinese martial art, played again by Donnie Yen.</p>



<p>Yuen Woo-Ping, whose resume includes work on “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and “The Matrix” films, stages fights that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/movies/ip-man-4-the-finale-review.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> deemed “thrilling” and full of “fluttering limbs in action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its imagery is “bathed in a mid-century wash that makes the film look like it came from an ad in <em>Life</em> magazine,” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ip-man-4-finale-1264391"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> wrote. The film’s signature scene involves a teacup, a revolving circular glass table, and two people who won’t back down.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="parasitenbsp">Parasite&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> South Korea<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Thriller<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 5/30/2019</p>

<p>The most pirated film last year shouldn’t be a surprise: as the first foreign-language film to win the Academy Award for best picture, it’s none other than “Parasite.”&nbsp;</p></div></div>

<p>A collection of “unpopular opinion” and get-rich-quick party spoiler “stop the music” articles on “Is Bitcoin a Ponzi? Is Bitcoin a Speculative Bubble? Is Bitcoin a Digital 21st Century Tulip Mania? Is Bitcoin Comedy Gold?”</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Prize Economists at various times, including Robert Shiller on 1 March 2014, Joseph Stiglitz on 29 November 2017, and Richard Thaler on 21 December 2017. On 29 January 2018, a noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as “a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology”, on 2 February 2018, professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the “mother of all bubbles”, and on 27 April 2018, a University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.</p>

<p>On 4 December 2013, Alan Greenspan referred to it as a “bubble” as did George Soros on 25 January 2018. Warren Buffett called bitcoin a “mirage” on 13 March 2014.</p>

<p>Do surgeries work? Most of us assume they do, but is there any scientific evidence that they do?</p>

<p>In this episode, I talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/drianharris">Dr Ian Harris</a> who is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Australia. He is a practicing orthopedic surgeon specializing in trauma surgery. Outside his practice, his research interests broadly cover the topic of surgical effectiveness and clinical research.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Notes and key insights</h3>

<p>1/ <strong>What is a placebo surgery?</strong> It’s where you make an incision but not do anything. </p>

<p>It’s analogous to traditional placebo in medicine, where a sugar or salt pill is given instead of an active chemical to see whether the intended medicine has an actual impact.</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Majority of surgeries that Dr Ian Harris and other researchers have studied in fact are not more effective than placebos</strong>. This is shocking because even when we have no proof that they work, many of these surgeries are happening even today.</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Examples of such ineffective surgeries include back pain surgeries and knee pain surgeries.</strong> For such surgeries, randomized control trials have found that if you make an incision in the knee but don’t do anything, it’s as effective as actually conducting the surgery of the knee.</p>

<p>4/ Why do patients get better if the surgery doesn’t work? It’s because<strong> many diseases or pain have a natural progression</strong>, and we generally seek surgical/medicinal intervention when we’re in the worst condition. If the body heals / condition becomes better after that, we attribute improvement to the intervention rather than thinking it could have happened anyway (due to the natural course of the condition).</p>

<p>5/ As Dr Ian Harris said, the unsaid attitude could be stated like: “<strong>you have to operate on patients quickly before they get better</strong>“.</p>

<p>Remember: in many cases, if you get sick, you get better after that. And that is why placebos seem to work.</p>

<p>6/ It’s shocking to hear that randomized controlled trials (RCT) for many surgical interventions end up finding that they’re ineffective.</p>

<p>But what’s most shocking is that <strong>many other interventions have never been subjected to an RCT against a placebo</strong>. For many of the common procedures traditionally practiced, we don’t know whether they work at all or not.</p>

<p>7/ For sure, there are many studies that study variations of surgical methods. That is, they try to find out whether an incision from the left is better or from the right. </p>

<p>But very few studies try to find out whether the incision does anything at all for the patient. Shocking, but that’s the truth.</p>

<p>8/ In that sense, <strong>surgery is different than medicine</strong>. All new pharmaceutical molecules are subjected to rigorous clinical trials where they’re tested against placebo or doing nothing. In many countries, there’s no such procedure for surgical treatments. If there is a procedure for new surgical procedures, nobody is testing old ones that have been getting performed every day without evidence.</p>

<p>8/ If research indicates many of the currently practiced surgeries don’t work, why are they still practiced?</p>

<p>Well, <strong>if your salary depends on not believing something, you won’t believe it.</strong></p>

<p>9/ And such <strong>denial is not new</strong>. The most common surgical procedure in history was bloodletting. This practice which lasted for thousands of years was only questioned in mid 19th century, and even after randomized trials showed that it hurt the patient, it wasn’t abandoned suddenly. It died a slow death as its practitioners started dying. </p>

<p>10/ Even today, the fact that practices like Homeopathy survive suggests that <strong>seeking evidence of what works isn’t a big priority for society</strong>. Perhaps keeping traditions is a bigger priority.</p>

<p>11/ But because it’s costly and risky to perform surgeries, the urgent question is: <strong>what surgical procedures are today’s equivalent of bloodletting</strong>? And those that we know are bloodletting, how do we get rid of them as a society?</p>

<p>12/ As a patient, what should you do? Dr Ian Harris recommends that every time your doctor recommends a medical procedure, <strong>ALWAYS ask for risks and benefits</strong>. </p>

<p>Risks are a given and doctors generally are happy to talk about them. But nobody asks for benefits because they’re assumed to be there. </p>

<p>Ask and confirm about benefits explicitly.</p>

<p>13/ What if the pain isn’t going away at all? Should you then get surgery?</p>

<p>Golden advice by Dr Ian -&gt;  “<strong>the severity of your symptoms does not change the effectiveness of the operation</strong>“</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Let’s say my goal this year is to get to 10k monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>

<p>MRR first, everything else second. I would ruthlessly cut out all activities that don’t lead to a measurable MRR increase. For example, I would stop writing blog posts like the one you’re currently reading. I certainly wouldn’t create fun projects like What to Tweet or take the time for non-transactional Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I would focus on my revenue generating projects, crank up the advertising machinery and do everything I can think of that potentially increases my MRR.
I’m fairly confident that I would reach 10k MRR by the end of the year. But at what price?</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back for a second.</p>

<p>You know who manages by metrics? Big companies like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>And what do they have in common?</p>

<p>Their core product got notably worse over time.</p>

<p>Google’s search results are dominated by ads and many users now use workarounds to find what they’re looking for (“Best headphone reddit”). LinkedIn looks like Minesweeper. Facebook was a fun place to meet friends. And if you search for an electronics product on Amazon, you immediately feel like you’re at a flea market in the middle of Shenzhen.
This is the result of hundreds of decisions that were motivated by a short-term focus on specific metrics like revenue and click rates. And while these decisions most likely optimized the metrics, they made the user experience worse.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t have the technology to measure the right thing. Or maybe the “right thing” is inherently immeasurable.</p>

<p>Or, and that’s my personal favorite, we’re dealing with a Schrödinger’s cat like situation. The “right thing” is only the right thing as long as we’re not trying to optimize it.
This is known as Goodhart’s law. “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.“</p>

<p>Let’s consider another example.</p>

<p>Who else manages by metrics? Politicians!</p>

<p>Instead of some boring historic example (there are plenty, just read “Seeing like a State”), I’m going to spice things up by talking about something that’s happening right now.
It’s not hard to anticipate what I want to talk about since there’s precisely one thing that’s currently happening: Covid-19.</p>

<p>Politicians try to manage the situation by focusing on metrics like the “R number”. At least here in Germany the motto is: let’s lower the R number at all costs.
Turns out the cost of this strategy is incredibly high. It’s just not immediately measurable.</p>

<p>For example, everyone’s getting fatter since all gyms and sport clubs are closed. Most people are developing unhealthy eating habits because there’s simply nothing else to do. Social connections are rapidly degregating even though everyone knows how important they’re for the human wellbeing.</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor and don’t play one on the internet, but I can easily imagine that there are lots of further unintended consequences of the current lockdown policy. For example, since most people now spend most of their time indoors alone and wear masks when they leave their homes, their immune system isn’t stressed regularly like it usual is. Hence I wouldn’t be surprised if many people will get sick of other diseases once the lockdown ends as a result of weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I’m all for taking Covid seriously. In fact, I’ve been hoarding masks since 2009. I spent the summer of 2009 with a bunch of friends in Lloret de Mar (a party hotspot in Spain) just when news of the swine flu started to emerge. Long story short, everyone in our group got sick (20+ people) except for my girlfriend and me because we’ve been wearing masks.
Now the most famous example how focusing on metrics can have unhealthy consequences is the cobra effect. I’ll just quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term cobra effect originated in an anecdote that describes an occurrence during India under British rule. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one more example I always have to talk about when the topic comes up: academia.</p>

<p>Stagnation apologists love to argue that the lack of progress in science is simply a result of the fact that all low-hanging fruit are gone.</p>

<p>That’s complete nonsense. There’s still plenty of low-hanging fruit. It’s just that everyone is so busy chasing meaningless metrics that they can’t see them.</p>

<p>In academia the metric of choice usually has something to do with the number of citations. But just like Google’s backlink-driven algorithm (which was in fact inspired by academia’s citation metrics) was quickly gamed by savvy webmasters, academia’s algorithm is gamed by careerists.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about some tiny minority here. If you want to survive in academia, you have to play the citation game. And if everyone is cheating, at the very least you have to do the same to stand a chance.</p>

<p>You have to partner up with others because five people can write five times as many papers. You agree to constantly cite each other. Likewise, you focus on incremental additions to established ideas because that’s the safest way to new publications regularly. You work on the stuff everyone else is working on because how else are you going to get citations?</p>

<p>And one thing you absolutely have to avoid like the plague is the risky and deep kind of research that leads to real progress in the field.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that citations are a bad metric, and we need to come up with smarter ones. Instead, it’s just Goodhart’s law in action.
Every attempt to manage academia makes it worse.</p>

<p>As soon a new metric is introduced it will misdirect the attention of scientists towards playing the game, instead of progressing science.</p>

<p>I talked about three areas, but the same pattern occurs almost everywhere. For example, just remember when everyone started minimizing fat in their diet or how grades are used to measure “learning”.</p>

<p>Crucially the problem is not the specific metric that’s being used. Whatever new metric gets introduced will soon again be made useless by Goodhart’s law. The metrics game will always be akin to Whac-A-Mole.</p>

<p>Now where does this leave us? If management by metrics doesn’t work, what else should we do?</p>

<p>First of all, I think that looking at metrics can be helpful. They just shouldn’t be the sole yardstick decisions are measured against.</p>

<p>And while the map never will be the territory, the picture you’re looking at gets more accurate the more metrics you consider. For example, if politicians would not just consider the R number but hundreds of metrics that take different aspects of a population’s wellbeing into account, the decisions would be better ones.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that decisions become much harder if you consider more than one metric.</p>

<p>But more importantly there are so many factors we can’t measure that nevertheless should be taken into account.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I become convinced that it all boils down to talking to people.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about surveys that distill thousands of standardized “conversations” into a few numbers or analytics tools that do similar things for behavior. I’m talking about real one-on-one interactions.</p>

<p>Just imagine if Jeff Bezos would talk to hundreds of real (non pre-vetted) Amazon customers each month and take what he hears in these conversations seriously. Or if politicians would have long conversations with regular people from all wakes of life. Or if academic committees would actually talk to applicants before filtering them out based on citation metrics.</p>

<p>In our hyper rational world it’s extremely hard to justify decisions based on the mere gut feeling you got from a few conversations. But this is exactly what people should be doing.</p>

<p>Engagement metrics will never tell you if users are genuinely happy when they use your product. But a few genuine conversations will.</p>

<p>A resume will never tell you if a person is genuinely interested in uncovering unknown truths about nature. But a 30-minute conversation will.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s so much easier to reach a consensus if you just hire the candidate with the highest citation metrics or implement the feature that will lead to the largest revenue increase in the next quarter. But while it’s the easiest decision it’s usually not the best one.</p>

<p>And I think the same applies not just to managing organizations but also to managing ourselves.</p>

<p>Just by listening to my own body I’ll always know better than any fitness tracker if I slept well, better than any blood test if my diet is healthy, and better than my bank account if I’m happy.
That doesn’t mean that I’ll not use a fitness tracker, make regular blood tests, or check my bank account. But I certainly won’t allow them to dictate my decisions.</p>

<p>I’ll look at all the facts and take everything in, even the stuff that can’t be measured, and then I’ll just go with my gut.</p>

		<div>

			
<p>Let me state up front that, while we’re going to be talking about an open source project that was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833206">recently submitted</a> to Hacker News’s “Show HN” section, the intent of this post is not at all to shame the developer who tried their damnedest to do the right thing. They’re the victim, not the culprit.</p>



<h2>RSA, Ya Don’t Say</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, an HN user shared <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet">their open source fork of a Facebook’s messenger client</a>, with added encryption. Their motivation was, as stated in the readme:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>It is known that <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-reads-messenger-messages/">Facebook scans your messages</a>. If you need to keep using Facebook messenger but care about privacy, Zuccnet might help.</p><p>It’s pretty simple: you and your friend have Zuccnet installed. Your friend gives you their Zuccnet public key. Then, when you send a message to your friend on Zuccnet, your message is encrypted on your machine before it is sent across Facebook to your friend. Then, your friend’s Zuccnet decrypts the message. Facebook never sees the content of your message.</p><p>I’m not a security person and there’s probably some stuff I’ve missed – any contributions are very welcome! This is <em>very</em> <strong>beta</strong>, don’t take it too seriously.</p></div><cite>From Zuccnet’s very humble README.</cite></blockquote>



<p>So far, so good. Facebook is abysmal for privacy, so trying to take matters into your own hands to encrypt data so Facebook can’t see what you’re talking about is, in spirit, a wonderful idea.</p>







<p>However, there is a problem with the <em>execution</em> of this idea. And this isn’t a problem unique to Zuccnet. Several times per year, I come across some well-meaning software project that makes the same mistake: Encrypting messages with RSA directly is bad.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet/blob/42e351e36b3b5dbaef06256ed11313fab77adb25/src/util/crypto.js#L57-L84">Zuccnet source code</a>:</p>


<pre title="">const encryptMessage = (message, recipientPublicKey) =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessage = crypto.publicEncrypt(
    {
      key: recipientPublicKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(message),
  );

  return encryptedMessage.toString("base64");
};

/**
 *
 * @param {String} encryptedMessage - base64 encoded string
 */
const decryptMessage = encryptedMessage =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessageBuffer = Buffer.from(encryptedMessage, "base64");
  const { privateKey } = getOrCreateZuccnetKeyPair();
  const message = crypto.privateDecrypt(
    {
      key: privateKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(encryptedMessageBuffer),
  );
};
</pre>


<p>To the Zuccnet author’s credit, they’re using OAEP padding, not PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This means their code isn’t vulnerable to Bleichenbacher’s 1998 padding oracle attack (n.b. most of the RSA code I encounter in the wild is vulnerable to this attack).</p>



<p>However, there are other problems with this code:</p>



<ol><li>If you try to encrypt a message longer than 256 bytes with a 2048-bit RSA public key, it will fail. (Bytes matter here, not characters, even for English speakers–because emoji.)</li><li>This design (encrypting with a static RSA public key per recipient) completely lacks forward secrecy. This is the same reason that <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP encryption sucks</a> (or, at least, one of the reasons PGP sucks).</li></ol>



<p>There are many ways to work around the first limitation.</p>



<p>Some cryptography libraries let you treat RSA as a block cipher in <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/">ECB mode</a> and encrypt each chunk independently. This is an incredibly stupid API deign choice: It’s slow (asymmetric cryptography operations are on the order of tens-to-hundreds-of-thousands times slower than symmetric cryptography) and you can drop/reorder/replay blocks, since ECB mode provides <em>no semantic security</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>much</strong> better strategy is to encrypt the data with a symmetric key, then encrypt <em>that key</em> with RSA. (See the <a href="#rsa-pkcs1">end of the post</a> for special treatment options that are especially helpful for RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.)</p>



<p>Working around the second problem usually requires an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE), similar to what I covered in my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/11/14/going-bark-a-furrys-guide-to-end-to-end-encryption/">Guide to End-to-End Encryption</a>. Working around this second problem <em>also</em> solves the first problem, so it’s usually better to just implement a forward-secret key exchange protocol than try to make RSA secure. </p>



<p>(You can get forward secrecy without an AKE, by regularly rotating keys, but AKEs make forward secrecy automatic and on-by-default without forcing humans to make a decision to rotate a credential– something most people don’t do unless they have to. AKEs trade user experience complexity for protocol complexity–and this trade-off is almost universally worth taking.)</p>



<p>Although AKEs are extremely useful, they’re a bit complex for most software developers to pick up without prior cryptography experience. (If they were easier, after all, there wouldn’t be so much software that encrypts messages directly with RSA in the first place.)</p>



<p>Note: RSA itself isn’t the reason that this lacks forward secrecy. The problem is how RSA is used.</p>



<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>



<h3>For Developers</h3>



<p>First, consider <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">not using RSA</a>. Hell, while you’re at it, <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">don’t write <em>any</em> cryptography code that you don’t have to</a>. </p>



<p>Libsodium (<a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages">which you should use</a>) does most of this for you, and can easily be turned into <a href="https://github.com/soatok/rawr-x3dh">an AKE comparable to the one Signal uses</a>. The less cryptography code you have to write, the less can go catastrophically wrong–especially in production systems.</p>



<p>If jettisoning RSA from your designs is a non-starter, you should at least consider taking the Dhole Moments Pledge for Software Developers:</p>



<blockquote><p>I will not encrypt messages directly with RSA, or any other asymmetric primitive.</p><cite>Simple enough, right?</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead, if you find yourself needing to encrypt a message with RSA, remind yourself that RSA is <em>for encrypting symmetric keys, not messages</em>. And then plan your protocol design accordingly.</p>



<p>Also, I’m pretty sure RSA isn’t random-key robust. Ask your favorite cryptographer if it matters for whatever you’re building.</p>



<p>(But seriously, you’re better off not using RSA at all.)</p>



<h3>For Cryptography Libraries</h3>



<p>Let’s ask ourselves, “Why are we forcing developers to know or even care about these details?”</p>



<p>Libsodium doesn’t encumber developers with unnecessary decisions like this. Why does the crypto module built into JavaScript? Why does the crypto module built into <em>most</em> programming languages that offer one, for that matter? (Go is a notable exception here, because their security team is awesome and forward-thinking.)</p>



<p>In my opinion, we should stop shipping cryptography interfaces that…</p>



<ul><li>Mix symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in the same API</li><li>Allow developers to encrypt directly with asymmetric primitives</li><li>Force developers to manage their own nonces/initialization vectors</li><li>Allow public/private keys to easily get confused (e.g. lack of type safety)</li></ul>



<p>For example: <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">Dhole Crypto</a> is close to my ideal for general-purpose encryption.</p>



<h3 id="rsa-pkcs1">Addendum: Securing RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5</h3>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Neil Madden informs me that what I wrote here is actually very similar to a standard construction called <a href="https://kel.bz/post/kem/">RSA-KEM</a>. You should use RSA-KEM instead of what I’ve sketched out, since that’s better studied by cryptographers.</p>



<p>(I’ve removed the original sketch below, to prevent accidental misuse.)</p>

<p>Today is the day I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law">Sturgeon’s law</a>:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Ninety percent of everything is crap.</p><cite>Sturgeon’s law</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I like this for a lot of reasons. But most of all, I like it as a nudge to try harder to enjoy things. </p>



<p>Think you hate poetry? Roller coasters? Banjo music? Thai food? Maybe you haven’t discovered the good 10% yet. Keep looking.</p>



<p>How about work? Think QA engineers are <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/04/dont-flip-the-bozo-bit/">useless</a>? Code review is a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">waste of time</a>? <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">Managers</a> hurt more than they help? Maybe you’ve been stuck with the crap 90% of them. Keep looking.</p>



<p>Then there’s relationships. Think there’s no one out there who can make you <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">happy</a>? Maybe you haven’t climbed out of your 90% of crappy relationships yet. Keep looking.</p>



<p>It reminds me of a <a href="https://ideopunk.com/2020/12/22/100-tips-for-a-better-life/">quote I read </a>recently:</p>



<blockquote><p>Keep your identity small. “I’m not the kind of person who does things like that” is not an explanation, it’s a trap. It prevents nerds from working out and men from dancing.&nbsp;</p><cite>Conor Barnes</cite></blockquote>



<p>Remember: <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/16/strong-opinions-loosely-held-sure-but-why/">strong opinions, loosely held</a>. If you think you hate something, hold that opinion loosely by putting it to the test. Try to prove it false. </p>



<p>Don’t be so quick to accept that something is not for you. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">Keep looking</a>.</p>

	<div>
		<p><span>As branding strategies evolve, tech companies continue to find ways to use white-labeling to create profitable apps. White-labeling refers to creating a foundational product or service that can be rebranded and further customized by other companies. This model </span><span>provides a way to service many brands with one product that still looks unique to end users. </span><span>In a previous blog post on </span><a href="https://www.inspiringapps.com/blog/mobile-industry/fintech-and-mobile-app-development/"><span>fintech and mobile app development</span></a><span>, we discussed the capacity of white-labeling to improve app integration and deliver data-driven tools. While there are many advantages associated with the decision to white-label a product, it is not without its challenges. We share our insights on the topic below. Learn how to use white-labeling to create profitable apps given the inherent strengths and limitations of the model.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Pros and Cons of White-labeling&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Although the practice of white-labeling apps exists across various industries, the business model for all brands is the same. Suppose you want to create a white-labeled “all resorts” app to service property management companies. This app would need to include features that appeal to virtually all resort managers. For example, the app could include the ability to view specific amenities of a resort upon selection. Property managers could further customize the app each time a resort is added to the product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although creating one product that services multiples resorts is </span>more efficient, this technique has its limitations. A significant con to white-labeling is the appearance of a lack of uniqueness. Using the all resorts app as an example, this product may be less appealing to individual resorts since they don’t want to be listed side-by-side in the same app with their competitors. Resorts would prefer to own their customer relationship and create the impression that they’ve done something unique to serve them.</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, the model benefits property managers because it is more efficient to maintain one app. It also simplifies things for users since they only need one app to access information about multiple resorts. White-labeled products also cut out the time and expense required to build users’ trust. Instead, companies deliver customized products to their existing loyal customer base. A customer who is familiar with a particular property management company is more likely to book a resort from its app. For this reason, white-labeling is especially useful to industries in which trust is paramount. This is why financial and medical institutions rely heavily on white-labeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Considerations for Developing a Profitable White-labeled Product&nbsp;</b></h3>
<h4><b>Limitations on brand-specific features&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>Limitations on brand-specific features substantially impact how producers use white-labeling to create profitable apps. Brands invariably request new features that may only be relevant to them. Offering no brand-specific customization is easiest for white-label providers. The more brand-specific features added to an app, the more difficult it is to maintain the app over time. It is tempting to individualize features in order to appease customers. The temptation is especially strong when a business is starting and revenue is especially critical. However, restricting the number of brand-specific features is key to profitability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The cost to develop a white-labeled product is relatively low at the start. Expenses grow over time as more brands (with more needs) are added to the platform. Ideally developers should strive to flatten out the expense curve so that the cost to add a new brand to the app is small. Setting limits on brand-specific customization is key to reaching this goal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Publishing Requirements&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The adoption of white-labeled products by multiple companies results in the availability of similar looking products that market themselves as being unique to a specific brand. This outcome inevitably presents a challenge to using white-labeling to create profitable digital products.&nbsp; It has also contributed to some pushback from Apple. Initially Apple chose to reject&nbsp; submissions from white-label providers</span><span>. Apple later relaxed its policy to allow white-labeled products to be created so long as each brand creates its own developer account and publishes its rebranded app through that account. This stipulation aims to strike a balance between Apple’s interest in an “app store cleanup” and the growing popularity of white-labeled products.&nbsp; Developers interested in creating profitable white-labeled products need to stay informed of these evolving restrictions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Adequate Specificity&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The design of white-labeled products needs to be general enough to be adopted by multiple brands yet specific enough to capitalize on niche markets and their goals. For example, </span><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-first-white-label-gaming-laptop-now-available-for-2200-will-be-adapted-by-resellers-like-Maingear-Schenker-and-Eluktronics.434609.0.html"><span>Intel used white-labeling to create a gaming laptop</span></a><span> that’s similar to a lot of other laptops but also has qualities that appeal to a specific market. The new product for gaming enthusiasts is conducive to white-labeling due to features including “</span><span>an advanced cooling system, excellent performance, great build quality, a light chassis, and shockingly good battery life.” The same connection between profitability and embodiment of a middle ground between generic and targeted features exists for white-labeled apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Alignment with Emerging Trends&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The most profitable white-labeled products provide services that are becoming increasingly popular. If relabeled products don’t reflect relevant trends, then they are unlikely to provide a launching point from which multiple brands can service a growing need. White-labeled products that are at the forefront of new trends are also able to acquire data that will become increasingly valuable over time. An example of a timely white-labeled product is<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fintech-junior-focus/cash-cards-for-kids-digital-banks-race-to-capture-the-next-generation-idINKBN27Y0RY"> Greenlight</a>, a debit card for kids that was recently white-labeled by Chase</span><span>. Fintech is now essential to personal banking. Therefore, apps that capitalize on this growing trend will be highly valuable to top brands.&nbsp;</span></p>

January 20, 2021 | https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Most task managers make two assumptions. Do you make them too?</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A task manager needs to remember all of your tasks</em> <br>(Would you buy a task manager that lost data?)</li>
<li><em>All tasks can use a similar creation workflow</em> <br>(You hit the ‘create issue’ button, and fill in some fields. Simple, obvious, how could it be better?)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not obvious that they’re wrong—they actually seem <em>useful</em>. But both at work, and at home, making these assumptions will reduce your effectiveness.</p>
<p>And if you have trouble context-switching, procrastinate tasks, or have an ever-growing task backlog that looms over your head, these assumptions have likely caused you unnecessary pain.</p>
<p>Here’s how they hurt us, and how to stop it from happening.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-tasks-cause-fatigue">Permanent tasks cause fatigue</h2>
<p>Before starting Tandem, my manager Tim previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/01/yahoo-acquires-to-do-app-astrid/">Astrid</a>, a personal task manager, which he later sold to Yahoo.</p>
<p>At Astrid, Tim tried an interesting re-engagement email. Users who had been inactive for 6 weeks were asked: “want to delete all your tasks and start fresh?”</p>
<p>The hypothesis was that these inactive users had tasks that overwhelmed them. Either the amount, the complexity, or the low importance of backlogged tasks, caused users to put tasks off. So every time these users visited Astrid, they saw tasks they couldn’t do, felt bad, and eventually stopped visiting—procrastination in action. Astrid’s re-engagement email offered the users a chance to start fresh.</p>
<p>It was impressively compelling. Most re-engagement emails get a 1% response rate. This email had about 5%.</p>
<p>I imagine those users had the same feeling you get when you move from one browser to another, or from one task manager to another, and leave your bookmarks, open tabs, backlogged tasks, to start fresh in the name of increased productivity.</p>
<p>But simply deleting the backlog doesn’t end the cycle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nowadays, Tim uses a simpler task manager—a notebook. He uses a page a day, adds some tasks from JIRA, and when tasks come in during the day, he writes them down and works on them when he’s available. These are mostly small tasks, things that are easy to forget. If he gets a bug (important to track) or a task he can delegate, he puts it in JIRA.</p>
<p>The notebook isn’t meant to store issues forever. The pages get turned, and previous information becomes less accessible. So the next day, if he needs to carry over something that hasn’t been completed, he needs to make the conscious decision to do so.</p>
<p>This solution solves task-management fatigue. And incidentally, it solves another problem:</p>
<h2 id="not-all-tasks-are-created-the-same">Not all tasks are created the same</h2>
<p>There is a gap in task management. When we look at the tools used for tracking tasks and goals, there’s something for every level of the company:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Goal</th>
<th>Tool</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Company quarter-level</td>
<td>Quarterly Goals</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Org quarter-level</td>
<td>KPIs</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs, JIRA Epics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team sprint-level</td>
<td>Tickets</td>
<td>JIRA Tasks/Bugs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal day-level</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>???</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Except at the personal day-level, where you’re working on tickets, getting requests for feature updates from your PM, bug discoveries from QA, and breaking down your actual tickets into different tasks, which may require subtasks that weren’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One proposal is that you should track all of these tasks, no matter how small, in JIRA. But the teams I see successful at implementing this are those that can afford to work at a slower, more “enterprise” pace. Which isn’t a problem—at least for engineering—but it’s often not an option at smaller startups, when learning cycles must be fast.</p>
<p><em>Even if you work at a larger company, at a slower pace, you may relate when it comes to personal life: tasks come from a variety of directions, at all times. You can’t toss every minor task in a task manager.</em></p>
<p>You can’t fix every task before the next one comes in. If you only use JIRA, you choose between possibly forgetting these small tasks, or breaking your train of thought to search, categorize, and fill out a form every time you get a small task.</p>
<p>On the flip side, quickly writing these down in a temporary place means that <strong>you don’t need to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend mental effort remembering minor tasks,</li>
<li>or take significant time to file minor issues.</li>
<li>Have your task manager filled with minor issues you’ve forgotten to close,</li>
<li>or leave hastily-written issues for later, when you forget what the vaguely titled issue is for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="correcting-for-the-mistakes">Correcting for the mistakes</h2>
<p>The solution is not complicated: use a temporary, personal task manager.</p>
<p>Don’t go out and buy something new. You already have something you can use at home. Tim’s notebook is a good example. I personally message myself on Slack (and iMessage, for personal use).</p>
<details zgotmplz="">
<summary>An example of how I Slack myself</summary>
<div>
<h4 id="using-slack-for-daily-personal-tasks">Using Slack for daily personal tasks</h4>
<p>When I’m working, and get a non-urgent task that would otherwise interrupt me, it goes in my Slack DMs. This is what it looks like:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7647.jpg">
</p>
<p>Some days are quiet</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7644.jpg">
</p>
<p>And some are hectic</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the morning, to re-build yesterday’s context, I just look at yesterday’s list. If there are unfinished items, I can carry them over. But it’s a conscious decision. I don’t need to carry over optional, low-priority tasks.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a bad memory, there’s a huge benefit for team stand-ups. I used to write JQL filters to search JIRA (doesn’t work—and misses tasks), now I just take a look at Slack.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>The important requirements are just that your task manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires effort to carry over old tasks.</li>
<li>Makes writing down tasks quick.</li>
<li>Isn’t used for notes <em>(anecdotally, this adds noise, and forces you to parse notes from tasks)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a task is critical, long term, or requires cooperation, file it in your normal issue tracker. Otherwise, it’s probably a daily, personal task, and you can file it in here.</p>
<p>So take out a notebook, open Slack, pick what works for you. And see if you don’t feel calmer and more in control of your tasks.</p>
<hr>


<p>I think these tools have interesting ideas to help individuals manage tasks.</p>
<h3 id="amna">Amna</h3>
<p>Ravi, my old college roommate and friend since high school, left Microsoft to build <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">Amna</a>, a personal task manager with tight browser integration.</p>
<p>I resonate with the thesis: recently I switched away from Firefox Tree Style Tabs, because I noticed that by organizing my tabs (which were part of tasks), it inadvertently became a de-facto task manager. But it wasn’t built for that!</p>
<p>Amna solves that exact problem: each task you do spawns a browser that keeps all of your relevant tabs.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna1.jpg">
</p>
<p>All the tabs in this browser window are related to the same task, and Amna keeps their state when I close the browser.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna2.jpg">
</p>
<p>After I'm done with a task, I can go back and look at the tabs I had open.</p>
</div>
<p>It helps prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle-memory opening HN, clicking an interesting blog post, and leaving it open “to read later” for several weeks</li>
<li>The pain of trawling through bookmarks and browser history, when you realize you forgot something</li>
<li>The clutter of leaving tabs open to prevent forgetting something</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve forgotten a time when you had less than five tabs open, <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">try using Amna</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jam">Jam</h3>
<p>Two of my ex-Cloudflare friends, Dani and Irtefa, started <a href="https://jam.dev/">Jam</a>. It’s probably the fastest way for PMs/designers to directly make comments on a website. So you get less minor interruptions, and more clarity on the requested change.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/jam2.jpg">
</p>
<p>All you do is type `jam` on the page, click an element, and type the comment</p>
</div>
<p>But I don’t include Jam here just for that. Jam also allows you to <a href="https://words.jam.dev/introducing-jam-wand/">offload the actual copy changes</a> to your PM, which flat-out decreases your minor tasks. If this sounds exciting, get on the waitlist <a href="https://jam.dev/">here</a>.</p>

For the last 2 years I’ve been working on a web browser that now cannot be completed because Google, the creators of the <em>open source</em> browser Chrome, won’t allow DRM in an <em>open source</em> project.</p><p>The browser I’m building, called <a href="https://github.com/samuelmaddock/metastream">Metastream</a>, is an Electron-based (Chromium derived), MIT-licensed browser hosted on GitHub. Its main feature is the ability to playback videos on the web, synchronized with other peers. Each client runs its own instance of the Metastream browser and transmits playback information to keep them in sync—no audio or video content is sent.</p><p>If someone is creating a browser that wants to playback media, they’ll soon discover the requirement of DRM for larger web media services such as Netflix and Hulu. There are a few DRM providers for the web including Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay.</p><p>As far as I’m aware, Widevine is the only available DRM for a Chromium-based browser, especially so for Electron. Chromium accounts for roughly <strong>70% market share</strong> of all web browsers, soon to include <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10">Microsoft’s upcoming Edge browser rewrite</a>.

  <p><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/guides/children.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you read our other blog posts you might already know that around 90% of the people on our planet are breathing dirty air, and that an estimate of 7 million people die every year due to it <span data-cites="world_health_organization_2018">[1]</span>. You might also know that nearly half a million babies died in 2019 due to dirty air <span data-cites="state_of_global_air">[2]</span>.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that dirty air is bad for both children and adults, but all this might be a bit abstract for a parent. This blog post will mainly look at how the air can impact the development of children and how the air quality relates to absenteeism in school, for both children and teachers.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-childrens-cognitive-development">Impact on Children’s Cognitive Development</h2>
<p>There are multiple studies indicating that poor air quality can have an negative impact on a child’s cognitive development.</p>
<p>In a study <span data-cites="wang_2017">[3]</span> carried out in Los Angeles and surrounding counties, it was found that for every increase 2.5µg/m<sup>3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub> during the pre-teen and teen years, one performance IQ point was lost. Performance IQ is related to ones ability to solve new problems, and it is to a greater extent controlled by brain function, as opposed to something you can learn <span data-cites="boyd-barrett_2018">[4]</span>.</p>
<p>In a report by Unicef <span data-cites="rees_2017">[5]</span> it is mentioned how air pollution can impact memory and verbal and non-verbal IQ. Furthermore, it is mentioned that test scores and average grades (GPA) have been shown to be negatively impacted by air pollution exposure. Also prenatal exposure is discussed. A study they mention showed that prenatal exposure to air pollution resulted in a four-point drop in IQ by the age of 5. In addition to this study, also <span data-cites="monica_2018">[6]</span> shows that exposure during fetal life can have negative consequences on brain development. Air pollution seems to haunt us throughout our whole lives, from foetus to when old (especially if you are male) <span data-cites="un_environment_2018">[7]</span>.</p>
One of the studies referenced in the Unicef report looked at 2,715 children between 7 and 10 years old in schools in Barcelona <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>. The study concludes <q>Children attending schools with higher traffic-related air pollution had a smaller improvement in cognitive development.</q>. However, the editor comments:
<blockquote>
Importantly, these findings do not prove that traffic-related air pollution causes impairment of cognitive development. Rather, they suggest that the developing brain may be vulnerable to traffic-related air pollution well into middle childhood, a conclusion that has implications for the design of air pollution regulations and for the location of new schools. <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>
</blockquote>
<p>In <span data-cites="emily_2018">[9]</span> researchers looked at children when they were 9 months old and then 3 years old. They observed that exposure to high levels of NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3. They also looked at indoor damp or condensation (which can be a hint for poor ventilation), and observed that it was associated with reduced verbal ability. Furthermore, they looked at exposure to second hand smoking, which perhaps unsurprisingly was also associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3 years.</p>
<p>Researchers have also looked at the commute to school and found that PM<sub>2.5</sub> and black carbon (BC) exposure was associated with diminished growth of working memory <span data-cites="alvarez_2017">[10]</span>.</p>
<p>The findings seem fairly consistent - dirty air is harmful. We therefore believe it is worth paying attention to the air quality in the environments where our children spend a large portion of their early lives. We can not eliminate air pollution exposure, but at least it can be reduced thorugh awareness and taking actions if needed.</p>
<p>Also IQAir has looked at this topic and written an article <q><a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/lp/blog/new-parents/can-clean-air-increase-child-iq">Can clean air increase child IQ?</a></q>. They found some of the same references as we, but also some others. We recommend you to have a look if you are curious about this topic.</p>
<h2 id="cleaner-air-leads-to-fewer-sick-days">Cleaner Air Leads to Fewer Sick Days</h2>
<p>Perhaps more concrete than air pollution’s impact on cognitive development is how it affect the number of sick days. This can naturally also in turn impact a child’s development, since day care (or school) is supposed to be a place where children both have fun and learn new things.</p>
<p>One study <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span> found that with air purification non-attendance was decreased by 55% in a preschool. Another experiment, also in a Swedish preschool, showed a reduced sick-leave of at least 22.5% <span data-cites="jagemo_2019">[12]</span>.</p>
<p>A school in Finland also observed reduced sick leave <span data-cites="genano">[13]</span>, as well as improved concentration, after installing air purifiers. However, we couldn’t find any numbers for how much.</p>
<p>In London, following the release of The Mayor’s School Air Quality Audit Programme <span data-cites="london">[14]</span>, a number of schools followed the recommendation to get air purifiers. 56 teachers were surveyed after getting air purifiers, and more than half of them reported having noticed a decrease in sick leave among themselves and children <span data-cites="blueair_2019">[15]</span>.</p>
<p>There is also some support for reduced absenteeism among teachers with better air quality, for instance <span data-cites="ervasti_2012">[16]</span> found such a connection. We will in the future look into absenteeism at workplaces and its relation to air quality. We suspect there will be more research about that than teachers specifically.</p>
<p>The Västra Götaland Regional Council in Sweden has observed large variations in sick leave among preschools and theorize that this might be due to differences in indoor air quality <span data-cites="vg_2017">[17]</span>. This is expanded on <span data-cites="gustafsson_2017">[18]</span> in Läkartidningen, the official Journal of the Swedish medical association. The doctors point out that the indoor air often has more particles than the outdoor air (in Sweden), both because of indoor activities and that small particles from traffic get in. Children are said to be especially vulnerable to air pollution. The doctors theorize that indoor pollution act as an additional burden on children’s immune system, which risks making it less able to cope with viruses.</p>
<p>Important to note is that many of the above references have links to companies with commercial interests. Sadly, it is hard to find studies without any ties to industry. We found at least two double-blind studies <span data-cites="reisman_1990">[19]</span> <span data-cites="weichenthal_2013">[20]</span> supporting health benefits of air pollution reduction through the usage of air purifiers though. Note that also the European Commission did a research project called SINPHONIE looking at improving air quality in schools and kindergartens. See the <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC91160/lbna26738enn.pdf">final report</a> for a deep dive into this topic. They also cover absenteeism, and on top of <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span>, they reference <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47620251_Association_between_substandard_classroom_ventilation_rates_and_students'_academic_achievement">Association between substandard classroom ventilation rates and students’ academic achievement</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11146405_Indoor_air_microbes_and_respiratory_symptoms_of_children_in_moisture_damaged_and_reference_schools">Indoor air microbes and respiratory symptoms of children in moisture damaged and reference schools</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45200045_The_Impact_of_School_Building_Conditions_on_Student_Absenteeism_in_Upstate_New_York">The Impact of School Building Conditions on Student Absenteeism in Upstate New York</a>. All in support for that there’s a link between air quality and absenteeism.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We believe there’s enough supportive evidence for it being worth to make sure that the indoor air quality is good (below <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health">WHO limits</a>), and if not, take action. We’ll try to write a new post in the future more focused on what one can do, but meanwhile, some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young child, pay attention to outdoor air pollution and consider an air purifier if pollution is high. It appears that air pollution may be more harmful the younger the child is.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider asking your preschool to get an air purifier if it is located close to heavy traffic or the air quality seems low. Some preschools are already aware of this, for instance <a href="http://eduwingskids.com/air-quality-in-eduwings-kindergarten/">Eduwings</a> have a strategy in place. Sadly it appears that mainly private expensive preschools are using air purifiers, at least in China <span data-cites="dandan_2016">[21]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce indoor activities that can lead to increased air pollution. For instance high temperature cooking, usage of candles or other indoor combustion. A well maintained kitchen hood and ventilation system can mitigate air pollution build-up. But you can also just open your window when cooking with high temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer walking in the forest or through a park rather than along roads with high traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>Install an app, such as <a href="https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-app">IQAir’s Air Visual</a>. It can help you to know when air pollution is high, so that you can reduce air pollution exposure. For instance by staying indoors the worst days, preferably in a room with an air purifier. Or at least avoiding heavy outdoor exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize second hand smoking, especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young children.</p></li>

January 20, 2021 | https://materialize.com/a-simple-and-efficient-real-time-application-powered-by-materializes-tail-command/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.com/a-simple-and-efficient-real-time-application-powered-by-materializes-tail-command/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Within the web development community, there has been a clear shift towards frameworks that implement incremental view maintenance and for good reason. When state is updated incrementally, applications perform better and require fewer resources. Using Materialize, developers and data analysts can adopt the same, event driven techniques in their data processing pipelines, leveraging existing SQL know-how. In this blog post, we will build an application to demonstrate how developers can create real-time, event-driven experiences for their users, powered by Materialize.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:<br>
This post is the fulfillment of the goals that I had when writing <a href="https://materialize.com/streaming-tail-to-the-browser-a-one-day-project/">Streaming TAIL to the Browser</a>. That post is not required to understand this post but familiarizing yourself with the <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/tail/#main">TAIL command</a> is recommended.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Demonstration of What We Will Be Building</h3>
<p>In this post, we are going to use the demo from our documentation’s <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/">Get Started tutorial</a> as the basis for building a minimal web application. The application allows users to see the total number of edits made to Wikipedia, as well as a bar chart of the top 10 editors. Here is an animation that shows the final result:</p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201766%201296%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10-live-1.gif" alt="" width="1766" height="1296"></p>
<hr>
<p>Want to run this demo yourself? Awesome! Clone our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize">repository</a> and follow the instructions for <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/ea5a6f0603875b752745838eb1228a90fc7e8476/play/wikirecent#running-it-yourself">Running it Yourself</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Desired Properties of the Solution</h3>
<p>Before jumping into how to build this, let’s outline the desired properties for our solution. The final solution should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push-Based</strong> – Instead of having the client poll for updates, updates should be initiated by the server and only when the client state is outdated.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> – Clients should present both a consistent and complete view of the data, regardless of when the application is loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Unbuffered</strong> – Clients should receive updates as soon as changes are made to the underlying datasets, without arbitrary delays in the data pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Economic</strong> – Size of updates should be a function of the difference between the current state and the desired state. Additionally, clients should not be required to replay state from the start of history.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> – Applications modifying the source data (writers) should not need to know anything about the applications consuming the data (readers).</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is possible for other applications to meet several of these properties, I hope that this application will demonstrate why the solution presented is ideal for this scenario. A discussion of why this application meets the above properties, and why other solutions likely do not, is presented further down in this post.</p>
<h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
<p>For those unfamiliar with our getting started demo, here is the flow of data in our pipeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Looking at the system diagram below, we see that the entire data pipeline is contained within a single materialized instance:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Let’s discuss the role of each service in the diagram above.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you started the application, you can run <code>mzcompose ps</code> to see the containers started.</p>
<hr>
<h4>curl — wikirecent_stream_1</h4>
<p>This container runs <code>curl</code> to stream Wikimedia’s recent changelog to a file called <code>recentchanges</code> within a Docker volume shared with our materialized instance.</p>
<h4>materialized — wikirecent_materialized_1</h4>
<p>This container runs an instance of <code>materialized</code>, configured to tail the <code>recentchanges</code> file and maintain our two materialized views: <code>counter</code> and <code>top10</code>. The views in this instance are configured exactly as documented in <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/#create-a-real-time-stream%22">Getting Started – Create a real-time Stream</a>.</p>
<h4>Python web server — wikirecent_app_1</h4>
<p>This container runs a Python web server that hosts the code for our JavaScript application and converts the row-oriented results from <code>TAIL</code> to the batch-oriented results expected by our application.</p>
<h2>Building Our Application</h2>
<p>Our example application is an asynchronous Python web server built using two libraries: <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/index.html">Tornado</a> and <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/">psycopg3</a>. There are three components to our application that I would like to call out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python code to subscribe to materialized view updates using the <code>TAIL</code> command and&nbsp;convert the row-oriented results into batches.</li>
<li>Python code to broadcast batches to listeners.</li>
<li>JavaScript code to apply batch updates for efficient browser updates.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Materialize uses the word <em>batch</em> to refer to a data structure that expresses the difference between prior state and desired state. You can think of a batch as a “data diff”.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Output for Our JavaScript Code</h3>
<p>To efficiently update our client view state, we wish to present a stream of batches over a websocket to any configured listeners. We define a batch as the following:</p>
<pre><code>batch = {"inserted": [ // array of rows to add to our dataset
],
"deleted": [ // array of rows to remove from our dataset
],
"timestamp": 0 // Materialize-defined timestamp
}
</code></pre>
<p>When a client first connects, we send a compacted view of all batches from the beginning of history:</p>
<pre><code>def add_listener(self, conn):
    """Insert this connection into the list that will be notified on new messages."""
    # Write the most recent view state to catch this listener up to the current state of the world
    conn.write_message(
        {
            "deleted": [],
            "inserted": self.current_rows,
            "timestamp": self.current_timestamp,
        }
    )
    self.listeners.add(conn) # subscribe to the stream of batches
</code></pre>
<p>How can listeners bootstrap their state using a batch object? If there is one property that I find particularly beautiful about this solution, it’s that first batch applied to an empty list <em>is</em> our initial state. This means that initializing and updating are the same operation. This batch object is so useful that D3’s <a href="https://d3js.org/#enter-exit">update</a> and Vega’s <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/#view_change">change</a> APIs expect updates to come in a similar form.</p>
<p>However, results from tail are row-oriented. We need a little bit of code to convert from rows to batches; here is an example of the desired conversion:</p>
<pre><code># We need to convert this stream of rows...
1608081358001 f -1 ['Lockal', '4590']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Epidosis', '4595']
1608081358001 f -1 ['Matlin', '5220']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Matlin', '5221']
1608081359001 t \N ['\\N', '\\N']

# ...to this data structure.
timestamp = 1608081358001
inserted = [('Epidosis', '4595'), ('Matlin', '5221')]
deleted = [('Lockal', '4590'), ('Matlin', '5220')]
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at the code to subscribe to view updates and transform rows into batches.</p>
<h3>Subscribing to TAIL</h3>
<p>To process rows from <code>TAIL</code>, we must first declare a cursor object that will be used to indefinitely iterate over rows. To help with our code know when to broadcast an update, we ask for progress markers in the response:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view(self):
    """Spawn a coroutine that sets up a coroutine to process changes from TAIL."""
    async with await self.mzql_connection() as conn:
        async with await conn.cursor() as cursor:
            query = f"DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR TAIL {self.view_name} WITH (PROGRESS)"
            await cursor.execute(query)
            await self.tail_view_inner(cursor)
</code></pre>
<h3>Converting Rows to Batches</h3>
<p>We’ve now created a communication channel which can be used to await results from the tail query. Whenever our view changes, our application will be notified immediately and we can read the rows from our cursor object. <code>tail_view_inner</code> implements the logic to process rows and convert them to batches:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view_inner(self, cursor):
    """Read rows from TAIL, converting them to updates and broadcasting them."""
    inserted = []
    deleted = []
    while True:
        # Block until there are new results (FETCH is not buffered)
        await cursor.execute(f"FETCH ALL cur")

        async for (timestamp, progressed, diff, *columns) in cursor:
            # The progressed column serves as a synchronization primitive indicating that all
            # rows for an update have been read. We should publish this update.
            if progressed:
                self.update(deleted, inserted, timestamp)
                inserted = []
                deleted = []
                continue

            # Simplify our implementation by creating "diff" copies of each row instead
            # of tracking counts per row
            if diff &lt; 0: deleted.extend([columns] * abs(diff)) elif diff &gt; 0:
                inserted.extend([columns] * diff)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Bad data from TAIL: {row}")
</code></pre>
<h3>Updating Internal State and Broadcasting to Listeners</h3>
<p>Now that we have a batch object, we apply this change to our own internal <code>VIEW</code> and broadcast the change to all listeners:</p>
<pre><code>def update(self, deleted, inserted, timestamp):
    """Update our internal view based on this diff."""
    self.current_timestamp = timestamp￼

    # Remove any rows that have been deleted
    for r in deleted:
        self.current_rows.remove(r)

    # And add any rows that have been inserted
    self.current_rows.extend(inserted)

    # If we have listeners configured, broadcast this diff
    if self.listeners:
        payload = {"deleted": deleted, "inserted": inserted, "timestamp": timestamp}
        self.broadcast(payload)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>Design Decision</strong>:<br>
Experienced readers will note that by maintaining an internal copy of the view in our Python web server, we can reduce the number of connections to the materialize instance. This is a strictly optional design decision that I made when writing this code — materialized connections are very light-weight when compared to other databases. We expect that there will be use cases where you will want one or more materialized connection per user. Consider temporary materialized views feeding dashboards personalized to each user, for example.</p>
<p>In the case of this application, I opted to reduce the connections out of habit rather than necessity. It does also enable a larger degree of fan-out, if we wanted to serve millions of clients, for example.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Updating User Views</h3>
<p>Now that we have looked at the code for broadcasting an update, let’s show how our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/main/play/wikirecent/app/src/templates/index.html">JavaScript code</a> consumes these batches. Our application is showing two things: a <em>total edits counter</em> and a <em>top 10 chart</em>:</p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201766%201296%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10-live-1.gif" alt="" width="1766" height="1296"></p>

                <p>In computer programming, Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm, discovered/invented by <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/index.html">J. Paul Rodker Morrison</a> in the late '60s, that uses a "data processing factory" metaphor for designing and building applications.  FBP defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which communicate via data chunks (called Information Packets) travelling across predefined connections (think "conveyor belts"), where the connections are specified externally to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component-oriented.</p>
                <p>FBP is a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow">dataflow</a> programming characterized by asynchronous, concurrent processes "under the covers", Information Packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, "bounded buffer" connections, and definition of connections external to the components - it has been found to support improved development time and maintainability, reusability, rapid prototyping, simulation, improved performance, and good communication among developers,  maintenance staff, users, systems people, and management - not to mention that FBP naturally takes advantage of multiple cores... without the programmer having to struggle with the intricacies of multitasking!</p>
               <p>FBP exhibits "data coupling", described in the article on coupling as the loosest type of coupling between components. The concept of loose coupling is in turn related to that of service-oriented architectures, and FBP fits a number of the criteria for such an architecture, albeit at a more fine-grained level than most examples of this architecture.</p>
					<p>FBP promotes high-level, functional style of specifications that simplify reasoning about system behavior. An example of this is the distributed data flow model for constructively specifying and analyzing the semantics of distributed multi-party protocols.</p>
                <p><img src="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/bottling_factory.png" alt="Bottling factory" height="400"> </p>
                
                <p>
                    FBP involves a significant "paradigm shift" from conventional programming, as it uses an "assembly line" image of data processing, which really has to be used to experience its advantages.  Not surprisingly given the hold that the so-called "von Neumann" paradigm has over programming technology, over the last 40+ years a number of companies have come out with FBP-like or "FBP-inspired" systems (to borrow a term coined by Joe Witt of Cloudera), which do not involve this paradigm shift, including some of the biggest and most successful companies in the industry, such as IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the New York Times (see <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/links_external.html">FBP External References</a>).  Unfortunately, without the FBP paradigm shift, these systems cannot fully achieve the advantages listed above, although most of them combine a visual notation with some degree of componentry.  We have therefore been forced to use the term "classical FBP" to refer to the FBP architecture described in this web site.  It is hard for someone reading documentation to tell whether a given product calling itself "FBP- like" is "classical" or not,  but, roughly, multiple input ports, "back pressure", and asynchronism, constitute a sort of litmus test to check whether systems should be classed as "classical" FBP systems. While the FBP paradigm shift may cause some trouble at first, given the prevalence of the older programming approaches, in fact it embodies a simple mental model (not "simple" as in easy but "simple" as in elegant, to quote Joe Witt), and has proven over several decades to result in applications that are more understandable and maintainable than those built using the conventional (von Neumann) paradigm.
                </p>
	    <p>If you <i>have</i> come across Flow-Based Programming by way of NoFlo, Flowhub, Node-RED, or similar packages, it is recommended that you read <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/fbp-inspired-vs-real-fbp.html"><i>FBP vs. FBP-inspired Systems</i></a>, which attempts to highlight the differences and similarities between FBP proper, or "classical" FBP, (the subject of this web site) on the one hand, and NoFlo and other similar "FBP-inspired" systems on the other. </p>
                <p>FBP is described in J. Paul Morrison's book, <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/book.html">Flow-Based Programming: A New Approach to Application Development"</a>, now in its 2nd edition, which can be obtained in paperback form from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-2nd-Application-Development/dp/1451542321">Amazon</a>, or in 2 e-book formats: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-J-Paul-Morrison-ebook/dp/B004PLO66O">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/j-paul-morrison/flow-based-programming-2nd-edition/ebook/product-21172063.html">epub</a>.</p>
                <p>Further down on this web page you will find a bunch of useful links, including some videos demonstrating the use of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp/blob/master/README.md">DrawFBP</a>.  During FBP's early days, networks were coded by hand, and initially we used pencil and paper, followed by more sophisticated graphical tools, whether or not they played well with FBP software.  However, with the advent of good graphical support, we now have a powerful graphical tool (<a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp">DrawFBP</a>), and in recent years the emphasis has been shifting to doing the diagramming on-line, and then generating the network code (we can see this progression with other flow tools on the market).  Now that compile and run functions (for Java and C#) have been added to DrawFBP, the developer can do much of the development graphically, and on-line.
                </p>    
                <p>We are in the process of "growing" a <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/fbp-tutorial-filter-file">tutorial</a> which will introduce the reader to the basic concepts of FBP by means of a series of "steps", which use the diagramming tool DrawFBP to progressively expand an application diagram and generate and run code at many of those steps.  </p>            
            <p>There is a Google group on FBP, with almost 800 members, and a Slack channel has recently been set up - here is the invitation link, if you are interested in joining: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/fbphq/shared_invite/enQtOTM4ODkzMTYyODE3LTJiMmNlZjhiMWY1MDY1ODA4Y2YzNDBlNDZlMTBkMDNlMjcwNzg2MGZhZjA2NjJjYTliYTM0OTIyYmM0Yzk0MDQ">Slack invitation</a>.</p>

                <!--<p>We know you are tired of Powerpoint presentations, but <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/FBPnew.ppt">this one</a> (from 2007) gives quite a good overview of FBP - as it was at that time.  There is also a <a href="http://player.vimeo.com/video/79329015">video</a> (not very professional, I'm afraid!), where I present this at a Meetup in Toronto in Sept. 2013 organized by Paul Tarvydas, CEO of Tarvydas-Sanford Controls Inc., and Dann Toliver. It has a few jokes and reminiscences, and may be more accessible than the straight Powerpoint presentation!   The Paul referred to in the video is Paul Tarvydas. Towards the end (at 40:12) there is a brief demo of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="..\graphicsstuff\index.shtml">DrawFBP</a>.</p>-->

                    <p>Even before the World Heath Organization (WHO) assigned Coronavirus pandemic status, people were already coming up with “creative” ways of avoiding infection, some more effective <a href="https://www.gatechecked.com/some-nervous-travelers-are-wearing-water-jugs-to-protect-themselves-against-coronavirus-2440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than others</a>.</p>
<p>Masks and face shields are still selling like hot cakes as hundreds of thousands of cases are recorded daily globally.

<p>The AIR helmet tries to solve some of the problems faced when wearing masks. For starters, the unit features HEPA-filtered inlets and outlets, and has high-powered fans to keep air moving through the helmet, preventing stale air from collecting and fogging up the glass. According to the website, the battery provides the fans over 4 hours of life, and can be charged via the provided 6 foot long USB-C cable.</p>
<p>The big benefit here is the clear acrylic visor, taking away some of the “annoyances” of wearing traditional masks, like actually being able to see the person’s entire face and not having to struggle understanding what people say through those thicker cloth masks. Finally, the lower section has a washable cushion liner, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods.</p>

<p>With no mention about how sound travels through the device (maybe through the cloth lining at the back), I’m guessing the wearer would have to constantly be on the verge of a shouting match in order to be heard. Even though it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2XF4AsTtuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks relatively easy</a> to take off, I’m sorry for the folks out there who suffer from the regular runny nose.</p>
<p>Opinions about the helmet have been mixed, with some in favor and others out right mocking its design.</p>

January 20, 2021 | https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>You’re a software engineering leader, and you’re great at your job. You know that the optimal path for software development lies in figuring out which components of your design to implement from scratch and which have already been implemented by specialists and can be reused.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>You also know that these aren’t decisions that you can only make once – you have to keep reevaluating based on environment changes and the needs of new products.</p>

<p>Authentication is one of those components that you deal with all the time. Auth is a necessary part of any software product, but how you implement auth is not necessarily always the same. Careful consideration is needed, because your decision to outsource will not only impact speed of development, but also long-term product maintenance – you don’t want to slow down time to market because you re-implemented an entire auth system unnecessarily, but you also don’t want to use an auth system that is going to cause problems down the road.</p>

<p>So what are the primary considerations when making your decision?</p>

<h2 id="speed-to-market">Speed to market</h2>

<p>This is the most obvious consideration. Depending on the features you need, it could literally take months to implement auth in-house, whereas it could take less than a day to incorporate an outsourced solution.</p>

<p>You could say “but what if we only need a bare-bones implementation? Some salted hashes in a database and we’re good to go!” That’s a totally valid point, and if you don’t anticipate needing sophisticated auth features then your best bet might be to do a quick in-house implementation and move on.</p>

<p>However, time and time again I’ve seen product developers underestimate the sophistication of features that will be required when their userbases grow. Most of the time development organizations then fall prey to the sunk costs fallacy and double down on augmenting their in-house solution, even when it may be more efficient to abandon the home-grown effort and replace it with an outsourced solution. This will cause huge issues for maintainability, which I’ll talk about further below.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-breach">Consequences of an auth breach</h2>

<p>Planning for the worst possible case can prevent total financial ruin for your company or division. If a breach of security happens and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is leaked from your in-house auth system, it can not only cause your company reputational damage but also significant financial penalties (not to mention potential jail time if you try to cover up the breach).</p>

<p>If you outsource your auth system you can limit your liability, and also protect your reputation – if there is a breach on your auth provider’s side, it’s likely that the breach will extend beyond your company. A breach in an outsourced auth provider that is used by many different companies will be big news, and customers will be more likely to forgive you for making a mistake in your choice of auth provider than for implementing a poor auth system yourself.</p>

<p>A not-insignificant addendum is that I believe your in-house system is much more likely to suffer a breach than an outsourced provider who is an expert in security. I have no studies to support this claim, but I have never seen a major auth provider compromised, and I’ve definitely seen companies suffer breaches due to their own in-house auth implementations – <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/hacked-and-dumped-online-773-million-records-with-plaintext-passwords/">this article discusses a compilation of 21 million plaintext passwords collected from various breaches</a> wherein passwords were not hashed and salted by auth systems.</p>

<p>Properly storing passwords is an incredibly low bar, and yet companies that manage their own auth still do it incorrectly all the time.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-outage">Consequences of an auth outage</h2>

<p>While less damaging than breaches, outages can still cause reputational damage and liability issues if your SLAs make uptime guarantees. Similarly to breaches, if you outsource your auth system it’s likely that any auth outage will extend beyond your company.</p>

<p>As an example, when Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory (AAD) <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-azure-ad-authentication-outage-what-went-wrong/">went down for a good portion of the afternoon late last year</a>, logins for applications across the internet stopped working.</p>

<p>When your competitors’ authorization systems are down at the same time yours are, nobody blames you for it, but when you’re the only company having issues, you suffer reputationally. No matter what your outsourced auth system is (FusionAuth, Cognito, AAD, etc), you can be almost certain that you won’t be alone in the event of an outage.</p>

<h2 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h2>

<p>There are trade-offs here. The benefits to an in-house system include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your engineers can design the exact system to fit your needs, and you’ll have unrestricted ability to add very specific features if requirements change over time.</li>
  <li>If the same engineers who built the system are maintaining it, then they’ll have the context required to anticipate issues as they add features.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the drawbacks can be large:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex new features can take significant time to build. Outsourced auth systems likely have these features already built (things like multi-factor authentication, user management interfaces, analytics and audit logs, and brute force hack detection, among others).</li>
  <li>With an in-house solution, you’ll have to budget time to monitor new security threats and patch your system in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</li>
  <li>You won’t get the benefits of a dedicated team that are constantly improving your auth system. This is actually a bigger deal than it seems, because if you outsource auth then other companies will also be filing issue reports and feature requests on your behalf, so you reap the benefits of those extra eyes as well.</li>
  <li>In the case of mergers or acquisitions, an in-house solution is likely to be terrible at combining different databases of users and managing things like duplicates or incomplete data. Such enterprise identity unification efforts can founder on internal auth systems. FusionAuth, on the other hand, supports modeling different user bases with tenants.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost-of-in-house-vs-outsourced-auth">Cost of in-house vs outsourced auth</h2>

<p>When building an in-house auth system your costs are all ostensibly sunk (engineer salaries). However, if building your system in-house delays time to market or prevents creation of other features, the build could cost you a significant amount of real income. There will also be on-going maintenance costs with an in-house solution.</p>

<p>When making cost calculations, you should compare:</p>

<p><strong>Revenue lost by slower time-to-market PLUS engineering cost to implement in-house solution PLUS on-going maintenance costs of in-house solution PLUS increased risk of data breach PLUS increased risk of outage PLUS increased risk during a merger or acquisition</strong></p>

<p>vs</p>

<p><strong>The monthly cost incurred by an outsourced provider PLUS the lack of complete control</strong></p>

<p>When evaluating different auth providers, you’ll also want to consider whether an outsourced provider charges on a sliding scale based on number of users or if the cost is fixed. AWS Cognito, for instance, will continue to charge more as your application gains more users. FusionAuth, in contrast, has options that charge a single rate for unlimited users. If your app is small and you don’t expect it to grow much, a sliding scale may be better for you. If you don’t want a large unexpected bill as you gain more users, a provider that allows for fixed costs may be more appealing.</p>



<p>As a final consideration, you may want to evaluate if your engineers even have the ability to implement a secure in-house auth system without a significant investment in education. This is something that many leaders dismiss, since they have great faith in the intelligence and skill of their people.</p>

<p>However, knowledge and intelligence aren’t the same, and just because your engineers are capable of becoming auth experts doesn’t mean you want them to spend the time to do so.</p>

<p>As an engineering leader, you have a responsibility to ensure that your engineers are spending their time on efforts that will optimally contribute to the long-term success of your organization. Auth is a necessary component, but is it really a differentiator for your application?</p>

<p>Only you have the context to make the best decisions for your company, but I hope this article has helped you think through some of the considerations involved in outsourcing your auth.</p>

  <p>Jan 20, 2021</p>




&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<p>I moved this website “worldofmatthew.com” away from CloudFlare back in August 2020.</p>
<p>That should have been the end of the relation with CloudFlare for my website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while I was moving the L7 Anti-DDOS protection to path.net (via a reseller), I checked the SSL Transparency and noticed that CloudFlare still had a <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=3006080109&amp;opt=ocsp">vaild SSL certificate for this website</a>.</p>
<p>Even worse, this CloudFlare certificate lasts for a year, meaning they have a SSL certificate for this website, until June 2021.</p>
<h2 id="irrevocable-ssl-certificates-by-cloudflare">Irrevocable SSL Certificates by CloudFlare</h2>
<p>This website currently uses path.net for DDOS migration. Just like CloudFlare, they have their own SSL certificate for this website. As they require it to MITM website requests to block anyone trying to perform an L7 attack.</p>
<p>The difference is that path.net uses Let’s Encrypt, which would allow me to revoke their SSL certificate for this website. All I would have to do is to download the public key and present that with an Acme challenge and then I can revoke it.</p>
<p><strong>You would think that it would be possible to get a CloudFlare SSL certificate revoked?</strong></p>
<p>How about No?</p>


<center>
<picture>
	<img src="https://worldofmatthew.com/img/2021/01/cfupgrade.png" alt="Cloudflare charging $10 for a web master to have control over SSL.">
</picture>
</center>

<p>Well. Unless you want to pay CloudFlare $10 per month to gain access to the “<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/advanced-certificate-manager">Advanced Certificate Manager</a>”.</p>
<p>This would give access to use a custom Let’s Encrypt. This would also allow you to set your SSL certificate validity period to as low as 14 days, rather than a year on the free “Universal SSL”.</p>
<p>Basically, it is a case of pay CloudFlare $10 per month or they get 100% control over your SSL certificate and will deny your requests to revoke.</p>
<p>In fact, the official stance of the SSL team at CloudFlare is that they won’t revoke unless the team has “<a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/revoke-and-prevent-the-issuing-of-certificates/235478/28">determined the private key was compromised</a>.”</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t this sounding pretty corrupt?</strong></p>
<p>Yes….</p>
<p>You blindly trust that CloudFlare will delete the SSL certificate upon leaving. They will provide you zero evidence of them of actually deleting the certificate.</p>
<p>This is from a CDN who has a level of access unmatched by their rivals. CloudFlare are becoming the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/02/25/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/">defualt DNS for browsers</a> and have a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">VPN service</a>.</p>
<p>You have to trust them to never abuse that power.</p>
<p>Even worse, as they forcibly keep a working SSL certificate, they don’t even have to generate a new one. Meaning, SSL transparency <strong>WILL NOT</strong> show anything if CloudFlare ever decide to hijack and MITM traffic to your website.</p>
<p>If someone asks that a SSL certificate is revoked after leaving it, revoke it. The webmaster is no longer giving them permission to have a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>By not allowing for SSL certificates to be revoked, CloudFlare is in effect holding them hostage. It must not be the job of a Certificate authority to refuse such requests.</p>
<p>Most Certificate authorities would never lock a webmaster out of control of a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>They also would not tell people to pay of $10/month for get rights to revoke a Certificate.</p>
<p>This comes to a question of whether CloudFlare should even be in SSL chain-of-trust.</p>
<p>I requested for them to revoke, by not revoking Cloudflare are keeping an active SSL Certificate without my permission. I think such behavior should make browsers question if they can keep Cloudflare in their chain-of-trust.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>For the last two years, Mala Jadwani, a 31-year-old teacher, has received daily messages from her 60-year-old <em>chachi</em>. On their family WhatsApp group, her aunt, who started using a smartphone a few years ago, posts classic older-relative content: garden-variety motivational quotes, prayer emojis, home remedies for body aches, and “good morning,” “good afternoon,” and “good evening” greetings accompanied by pictures of babies and roses. On days when her chachi’s messages were particularly prolific, Jadwani’s phone would freeze, forcing her to disable WhatsApp’s automatic photo download setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But last week, her chachi’s<em> </em>WhatsApp messages suddenly stopped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worried, Jadwani called her aunt. It turned out that she had read a chain of viral messages on WhatsApp, which falsely said the platform’s messaging system was no longer private. She was one of millions of users who received a push notification from WhatsApp earlier this month, explaining that the company was updating its privacy policy, mostly in superficial ways. After February 8, 2021, “you’ll need to accept these changes to continue using WhatsApp,” <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/whatsapp_new_privacy_policy_facebook-news-47077.php">the update read</a>. The thought of her WhatsApp messages being exposed frightened Jadwani’s aunt so much, she said, that she stopped sending messages on WhatsApp altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India is WhatsApp’s largest consumer market by many measures, but backlash against the recent privacy policy change is now threatening its future in the country. Many people have debated the update with their friends and family, and it’s also been featured in nightly news shows and on the front page of local newspapers. Last week, Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, took <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90593913/whatsapp-facebook-privacy-outrage-newspaper-ads">out full-page advertisements</a> and plugged interviews <a href="https://twitter.com/digbijaymishra1/status/1349562056429641735?s=20">with the heads of WhatsApp</a> in newspapers, in an effort to mitigate the fallout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The change isn’t actually a departure from how WhatsApp has treated user data for years. The platform has shared metadata — phone numbers, how often the app is opened, and operating system information —&nbsp;with Facebook since <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/whatsapp-privacy-facebook/">2016</a>. The pop-up notification millions of users received on January 8 sought explicit permission to continue these existing practices. But unlike four years ago, “there was no opt-out option to refuse sharing information with Facebook companies,” said Apar Gupta, executive director of the nonprofit Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF).</p>



<p>The new changes are related to how businesses communicate with WhatsApp users. The update made it clearer that commercial activity on the messaging platform has the potential to spill over into other Facebook apps: “a handbag you browse on WhatsApp could pop up later in your Instagram app,” as <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/whatsapp-data.html">explained</a>. Over <a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660772483104769?s=20">175 million</a> people already message companies on WhatsApp, and the updated terms of service would make it “easier to chat with businesses who may use Facebook business products,” <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/about-new-business-features-and-whatsapps-privacy-policy-update">reads a blog post</a> from WhatsApp’s communications team. The post claims that the update would enable customer service features like purchase receipts.</p>



<p>The confusing change triggered a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/signals-downloads-skyrocketed-4200-after-whatsapp-announced-it-would-force-users-to-share-personal-data-with-facebook/articleshow/80232029.cms">mass exodus</a> of WhatsApp users, who moved to other messaging platforms like Signal and <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/terror-on-telegram/">Telegram</a>. After the disastrous rollout, Facebook later announced it was delaying updating its privacy policy by three months, but for loyal WhatsApp users, the damage has already been done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook’s privacy practices and <a href="https://thewire.in/business/facebook-is-misleading-indians-with-its-full-page-ads-about-free-basics">policy decisions</a> in India have long been criticized. What’s different this time are the demographics of the people who are outraged: uncles and aunties. For the first time, India’s most loyal and engaged users are questioning the intentions of an app that has grown to encompass nearly every aspect of their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WhatsApp groups are an indispensable part of South Asian families: they’re a forum for gossip, dodgy forwarded messages, boisterous political debates, and generally the primary way for relatives to stay in touch. Many of these WhatsApp family groups — including my own — erupted with anger and confusion in the days after the platform sent the pop-up message announcing its new policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sheshadri Narayanane, a friend from high school, is a part of two family groups. He said his 70-year-old aunt falsely believed WhatsApp had been granted access to her bank accounts. <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/whatsapp-pay-enters-india/">WhatsApp recently launched payments</a> in India, allowing users to send and receive money by connecting their bank accounts to the messaging app. The privacy update came shortly after WhatsApp Pay was launched, which might have caused some of the confusion. “Bad timing is my theory,” Narayanane speculated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On prime-time talk shows, news hosts likened the update to <em>digital dadagiri</em>, or “digital bullying,” by WhatsApp. “They want to sell your chats — your data from WhatsApp private chats — to business enterprises,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0F5T1Q0z5Y">declared</a> one news anchor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The debates often took on a political tone. Some TV hosts asked questions about the government’s ability to protect India’s sovereignty. Gaurav Bhatia, the national spokesperson of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">weighed in</a>, saying his party would go to any lengths necessary to protect the privacy of its citizens. On January 19, the Ministry of Electronics and Communication Technology (MeitY) sent a request to Facebook to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/govt-tells-whatsapp-to-respect-privacy-of-indians-withdraw-new-policy/articleshow/80344964.cms?from=mdr">withdraw the new changes made to its privacy policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why is it that these social media giants, who need the India market, are having two different policies for different countries?” Bhatia said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">nightly news show,</a> referencing the fact that WhatsApp’s policy update <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/why-whatsapp-s-privacy-rules-sparked-moves-to-rivals-quicktake">does not apply to the European Union</a>. Some accused WhatsApp of treating Indians as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18of5M6g2M&amp;t=1625s">second-rate citizens</a>.” Local technology entrepreneurs who compete with Big Tech companies like Facebook soon <a href="https://twitter.com/vijayshekhar/status/1349186007007023104?s=20">piled on</a>.</p>



<p>Facebook has repeatedly emphasized that WhatsApp can’t see the content of end-to-end encrypted messages, which can be viewed by only the sender and receiver. Alternatives like <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2021/01/11/whatsapp-telegram-signal-privacy-security-comparison/">Telegram don’t necessarily offer</a> the same protections as WhatsApp. Digital liberties activists and advocacy groups like IFF <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152?s=20">recommend</a> using Signal instead for sensitive communications, and the app quickly became the number one downloaded app in India earlier this month. Signal commemorated its victory on Twitter. “Look at what you’ve done,” read a <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1347693761044701186?s=20">tweet</a> from the app’s official account, accompanied by an emoji of the Indian flag.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though users are downloading Signal and other encrypted alternatives in high numbers, switching might not be as simple for aunties and uncles who spent years becoming proficient in using WhatsApp. Vivek K, a 28-year-old tech entrepreneur, tried making the case to his mother that she should switch over to Signal and was met with an unenthusiastic response: “She said, ‘Now, you’re making me learn one more app? I can’t do it; I’m too old for this<em>,</em>’” explained Vivek.</p>



<p>For now, with the privacy update postponed until at least May, WhatsApp is working to mitigate the backlash. But people like Jadwani’s chachi are still staying away from the messaging app. Jadwani said she hasn’t missed the lack of daily greetings. “No wonder my phone hasn’t had issues,” she said with a laugh.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><blockquote><p>This is an in-depth review of how Synyx GmbH &amp; Co building is using Turing Pi board in combination with GitLab CI and Ansible for their CI/CD needs</p><cite>Author: Karl-Ludwig Reinhard</cite></blockquote></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In my previous&nbsp;article,&nbsp;I explained some cloudy statements about Ansible and Gitlab CI and that we’re going to work with a Turing Pi for that purpose. I already talked about the capabilities of this amazing board and the first steps it takes to get it up and running. Today I’ll go a little bit into details on what benefits we are having when running Ansible scripts in a CI environment and most important where the Turing Pi helps us.</p><h3>What we’re going to build with it?</h3><p>In our project, we have a lot of Raspis and configure them all with Ansible. From time to time we are adding new features and fixing bugs in our Ansible scripts and that makes them more complex. We are using GitLab to review our code, but what is missing is a validation of the syntax and that the code will actually work on production’s hardware. Considering that our team continues to grow, this adds more complexity. So we put 4 Raspberry Pis into a rack and integrated them as a deploy target for our merge requests.</p><h4>When a user opens a merge request, we reboot the machine and run the OS via the network. With that, we can flash the SD card with a fresh Raspbian. After a reboot, we can start our Ansible scripts to test if the merge request is sane.</h4><figure><img src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>With just running an Ansible Playbook for setting up hosts from 0 to 100 we get the following benefits:</p><ol><li>Check if the syntax is correct</li><li>Ensure that all needed files are committed</li><li>Can different configuration flavors still be applied?</li></ol><h2>Why do we need netboot at all?</h2><p>Our goal is to run our Ansible script against a freshly installed Raspbian. We cannot be sure, that the last tested merge request was flawless. The idea is to reboot the node into an NFS based root file system. From there we can flash a Raspbian and reboot into a clean OS. After that, we can apply &amp; test our Ansible scripts. Following this process guarantees, that every merge request gets a clean system without any leftovers from a previous run.</p><h2>Setting up Gitlab CI/runner</h2><p>To be honest&nbsp; – we’re currently stuck with a shell runner. We weren’t able to find a proper working docker image with ansible that doesn’t lack some tooling/libs that are currently required. Building a custom docker image would be possible but for the sake of simplicity, we use a simple shell runner.</p><p>First of all, we need to set up one node as a DHCP/TFTP boot server. Here is a good <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tutorial</a> on how to do this. We recommend to run one of the Turing Pi nodes as a DHCP/TFTP boot server – it’s more reliable than a server placed outside of the board.</p><p>One thing to note: The DHCP server is located behind a NAT router so it does not interfere with DHCP servers in our company network.</p><p>When the server is up and running, we need to set up the Gitlab runner.</p><ol><li>Due to the fact we rely on a shell runner Ansible has to be installed by hand. This can be done with your package manger. Also, install all dependencies that are needed for a successful Ansible run.</li><li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Install</a> GitLab CI runner. When asked which kind of runner, choose shell runner.</li><li>Add a custom inventory.<br>You can use your regular inventory and add there your ci host. Then you have to limit your Ansible run with <code><mark>–limit</mark></code> option. If omitted you’ll most probably deploy your prod system with every merge request 🙂</li><li>Add or change <code><mark>.gitlab-ci.yml</mark></code> accordingly:</li></ol><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">stages:
  - test-on-pis
  
test-on-turing-pi:
  stage: test-on-pis 
  script:
    - export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
    - mkdir $HOME/.ssh || true 
    - echo -e "Host 192.168.2.*\nStrictHostKeyChecking no\nUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" &gt; $HOME/.ssh/config
    - ansible-playbook reflash.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=Bai9iZaetheeSee5"
    - ansible-playbook initial.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=raspberry"
    - ansible-playbook site.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=Bai9iZaetheeSee5" -e "http_proxy="
  except:
    - master</pre><p>We do some „dirty“ SSH tricks at the beginning. This ensures that Ansible can connect to the systems even when the host keys have changed. That will happen with our setup after we reflashed the system. We tried to do this during an ansible run but weren’t successful.</p><p>Reflashing your Pi is really straightforward when the PXE server is setup. Let’s have a look at some excerpt:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">--

  when: root_mnt.stdout_lines[0] != "nfs"

  reboot:
  when: root_mnt.stdout_lines[0] != "nfs"
....

    port: 22
    host: '{{ (ansible_ssh_host}}'
    search_regex: OpenSSH
    delay: 60
    timeout: 120
  connection: local</pre><ul><li>• First of all, we check if the current system is already running on an NFS root filesystem. If so we can skip the next two steps. If not we destroy the current boot partition – just write some rubbish on the raw device.</li><li>• Next, we reboot the system.</li><li>• Then we flash the sd card/eMMC with the help of Zcat. We compress our images to save some HD space and be able to transfer them via a wan connection(if needed). The performance impact is negligible. One reboot later and that’s it. We have a freshly installed Raspbian and can apply our Ansible scripts to a fresh system.</li></ul><h3>Two things to note:</h3><ul><li>• We ignore errors when flashing. When the image is missing or similar, we just continue and reboot the system. In most cases, the system will be still accessible</li><li>• I couldn’t get the reboot module working properly. I think the newly flashed system does not have the same remote user and password as when we started the role. With this ugly part, it’s working 🙂</li></ul><p>Be aware that the above script is an excerpt from the main.yml of the corresponding role and is not complete!</p><h3>What we also do</h3><p>After a successful run, we apply some smoke tests. One flavor of our RPis is kiosk systems that start X11 and opens a chromium browser in fullscreen mode. With some „technical creativity“(aka mocking) we ensure that the browser is running. When this is not going to happen, the build fails. Another flavor is used for controlling an industrial actor and its basic functionality is also tested at the end. We do not test every aspect, it’s more of a kind of smoke tests or checks if certain TCP ports are open.</p><p>What we also want to know how our Ansible scripts affect a running system that is not flattened or rebooted on every run. We deploy two node continuously when a merge to master happens. With that, we can also monitor the memory usage on these systems and can identify possible memory leaks or stability issues when running a system longer time. It has served us well as an additional safety net.</p><h2>Why the Turing Pi is ideal for us</h2><p>Compared to our old setup we gained speed and stability of our builds. In the past, we had problems when booting multiple pis in parallel from the network. PIs were stuck in the boot process and didn’t get their kernel via TFTP or couldn’t mount the NFS root reliably. To this day, I’m not sure where I went wrong – I fixed it by throttling the reboots so that the Pis are booted one by one. That slowed down the „build“ significantly.</p><h4>With the Turing Pi we did not encounter any problems booting pis in parallel from the network at the same time. So after testing it a bit I removed the throttle and reduced the build time significantly</h4><p>Another thing we see a lot less stuck Ansible jobs because the network connection is flaky. I got the impression, that working with the network on the PCB is a lot more reliant. We use Turing Pi for two weeks as a replacement for our old „test cluster“ – can’t remember that I had to reset the cluster manually caused by a frozen job.</p><p>Currently, we work most of the time from home –&nbsp; Covid19 case numbers are rising in Germany and it looks like we’ll stay at home for some time. With some VPN and network magic, we can use some nodes as test devices from the remote. In the past, everybody got his „personal“ test pi, had to ensure proper network connection, flash the sd card manually, etc. Yes, you can use Raspbian X86 but some things like accessing Bluetooth or GPIOs cannot properly be tested in a virtual environment.</p><h2>What we’ve learned as a team?</h2><p>In our last review and retro, we talked also about our CI setup. We’ve agreed, that it helps us a lot in our day-to-day business and adds to the quality of our merge requests. For me personally, it is a very good incentive to use more merge requests so the CI pipeline is triggered and I am forced to work more in a clean way. But it takes time to set it up, stabilize some (ugly) parts – but after all the time investment is worth it. Additional tests and reviews improve the quality even in the context of configuring an OS and reduces the number of errors.</p><h2>What we miss with Turing Pi</h2><p>Not much to be honest. Two things would be really awesome:</p><ol><li>Switching the HDMI output from the first node to a different node via i2c</li><li>For flashing EMMc the first slot only can be used. It would be great if you could also use the other slots for flashing as well.</li></ol><p>I think achieving these two points isn’t easy and for us not really pain points 🙂</p><h2>Where we (maybe) want to go</h2><p>Currently, we are deploying our prod systems still from our workstations. Continuos delivery will be a topic for us. But something like „merge on master“ and deploy the prod system instantly is too risky for us. Our Pis are an integral part of our customers. And that’s not the definition for CD(for me :)). Our pis are not easily …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
    
    <p>I know a number of folks use <strong>The Great Suspender</strong> to automatically suspend
inactive browser tabs in Chrome. Apparently recent versions of this extension
have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleTaylor/comments/jowlt2/open_source_development_the_great_suspender_saga/">taken over by a shady anonymous entity</a> and is now
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/great-suspender-extension-now-flagged-malware-edge-has-built-replacement">flagged by Microsoft as malware</a>. Notably the most recent
version of the extension (v7.1.8) has added integrated analytics that can
track all of your browsing activity across all sites. Yikes.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for users of The Great Suspender (7.1.8):</strong></p>

<h3>Temporary easy fix</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable analytics tracking by opening the extension options for
The Great Suspender and checking the box
“Automatic deactivation of any kind of tracking”.</li>
<li>Pray that the shady developer doesn’t issue a malicious update to The Great Suspender later.
(There’s no sensible way to disable updates of an individual extension.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Permanent harder fix <small>(👈 <strong>Recommended!</strong>)</small></h3>

<ul>
<li>Close as many unneeded tabs as you can.</li>
<li>Unsuspend all remaining tabs. ⏳

<ul>
<li>⚠️ Any tabs that you forget to unsuspend will be lost
when uninstalling The Great Suspender in the next step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uninstall The Great Suspender.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.1.6">latest good version</a> of The Great Suspender (7.1.6) from GitHub,
and move it to some permanent location outside your Downloads folder.
(It should be commit 9730c09.)</li>
<li>Load your downloaded copy as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-you-can-still-download-chrome-extensions-without-us-1826796797">an unpacked extension</a>.
(This copy will not auto-update to future untrusted versions of the extension.)</li>
<li>All done! 🎉</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> My understanding is that installing an unpacked extension in this way
will cause Chrome to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25847171">issue a new kind of security prompt</a> every time it is
launched, which you’ll have to ignore. 😕</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>Other browser extensions for suspending tabs exist, as mentioned in the
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25846504">Hacker New discussion</a> for this article. However I have not conducted my own
security review on any of those other extensions, so buyer beware.</p>

      <article role="main">
        <p>In October, the popular and famous archivist tool <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a> was taken down by GitHub due to a DMCA request by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America#Criticism">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. I posted a <a href="https://assassinate-you.net/posts/2020/10/youtube-dl-takedown/">detailed analysis</a> explaining the relation between international, US, EU and German law, and showing why this request was very different from what most people know as the “classic” DMCA takedown request. I felt this was necessary since there were a lot of rumor and wrong claims out on the Internet (not just in forums or on the (anti)social media, but also on media offerings), which did not help the discussion at all. The repository is back now, thanks to the EFF and its team. They <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca">filed a counter-notice</a> on behalf of the youtube-dl maintainers, which allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository.</p>
<h2 id="eff-helps-out-by-writing-a-counter-notice">EFF helps out by writing a counter notice</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, a non-governmental organization based in the U.S. dedicated to defending civil liberties and especially digital rights, helped out the youtube-dl maintainers by filing a very informative <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">counter notice</a> with GitHub. This notice explained why the request itself is an abuse of the DMCA and the takedown was not justified at all. It allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository and, more importantly, all the metadata (for example, issues and pull requests) that was posted on the platform by users, developers and maintainers. Such information is invaluable to a project, and a takedown of the <em>entire</em> repository with all this data can hurt a project very badly.</p>
<p>The takedown was widely regarded as abuse of the DMCA by the RIAA, given that the youtube-dl code repository did not contain any infringing material. The argumentation was made up by claiming that the primary purpose was to infringe copyright of some songs whose artists are apparently represented by the RIAA. They cited some automated unit tests for this, which do not download the entire songs, and would not be seen or executed by regular users. The EFF argues that these are likely a form of “fair use” and thus allowed legally.</p>
<p>The request also cited an obscure German court decision which considered YouTube’s “rolling cipher” an “effective technological measure”, whose bypassing would be prohibited by copyright laws around the world. The EFF explains that the decision was “wrongly decided and is not binding nor even persuasive under U.S. law”.</p>
<p>The EFF further questions the effectivity of the algorithm in general, given that YouTube delivers the code for decryption in a readable form (and also, the code can be executed outside browsers, too). On top of that, the streams are freely accessible once you have the URLs. YouTube only hides the URLs, but not in an effective way. Therefore, this algorithm cannot be considered a “technological measure”, and thus, the RIAA request is baseless.</p>
<p>In the context of this debate, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS">DeCSS controversy</a> was mentioned a lot, as there’s been some similarities with how copyright holders reacted to the existence of software to bypass their (arguably not very secure) CSS protection. Their first actions focused on software hosting sites, pressurizing them to take down the software by threatening them with legal steps. This led to a mirroring campaign, due to what we call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> nowadays.
There’s been some litigation in the early 2000s, where judges ruled in favor of the copyright holders.
However, this has little relevance to the case of youtube-dl, as the EFF explains. Reverse-engineering YouTube’s code doesn’t enable users to save copies of the material, they already can do so in many other ways. Also, youtube-dl doesn’t bypass DRM technologies like Google’s Widevine. Also, there’s many resources under free licenses on the video platform, which users are explicitly allowed to download and share. And in the U.S., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress">Library of Congress</a> may even <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2018/10/new-exemptions-dmca-section-1201-are-welcome-dont-go-far-enough">issue exemptions of Section 1201</a> of the DMCA, under which bypassing anti-circumvention is fine legally.</p>
<p>EFF’s notice summarizes the situation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, youtube-dl does not violate either the Copyright Act or the DMCA. EFF  and  the  youtube-dl  maintainers  thank  GitHub  for  standing  up  for  the  rights  of developers whose projects it hosts. We hope this explanation will allow you to restore the youtube-dl repository so that GitHub can continue to be the home for development of this popular and important tool.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">EFF letter to GitHub on youtube-dl takedown</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, EFF! You did not just helped a tool that is crucial to journalists, activists, lawyers and so many other people. You also destroyed the RIAA’s wrong claims, which will hopefully prevent similar attacks on other tools in the future.</p>
<h2 id="githubs-reactions">GitHub’s reactions</h2>
<p>Regarding GitHub, it is sad that they took down the repository at all. It’s a well-known pattern: platforms rather comply with such requests than risking litigation, requiring projects to invest time and money to fund lawyers themselves (or hope for an association such as the EFF to pick up their case). The moment they published the request and took down the repositories, many experts immediately raised concerns that the request itself is illegal. It remains questionable why GitHub’s legal team didn’t recognize this. They likely were not prepared well enough for such a situation. GitHub did not stand up for the community that made them the most popular hosting platform for software in the world.</p>
<p>Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, later apparently reached out to the youtube-dl team personally, expressing his sympathy, and offering some support. However, the damage was already done then. The team lost its primary communication channel to their users and each other, as well as the entire history.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that their PR department recognized they are criticised heavily for taking down the project in the first place, putting their (actually pretty good) relation to the open-source community at risk, and thus creating a serious threat to their business.</p>
<p>At least this case prompted them to rethink their strategy on future lawsuits. They posted a <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">blog article</a>, excusing their takedown with compliance, as expected. They promised changes for the benefit of projects threatened by similar requests in the future at least, such as donating to a “developer defense fund” dedicated to helping out projects threatened by such anti-circumvention takedown requests.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they recognized that there is a strong need for maintainers to access the issues and pull requests. They promised to ensure that developers can export those after a takedown (even if requests are valid). The real question however is why they wouldn’t just keep showing them, and just hide the code repository. Introducing such an option globally for every repository would be an even bigger improvement, allowing developers to always create backups of those data.</p>
<p>As GitHub state themselves, among all DMCA takedown requests, these circumvention ones are quite rare. We will have to see whether it is going to have a lot of effect. It would be better if they just donated money to defend developers of projects for which they receive <em>any</em> kind of unwarranted takedown request, rather than limiting it to this edge case.</p>
<p>By the way: in the end, it’s up to the people to request better copyright laws from the politics. They tend to get worse, not better. Make sure your voice is heard. Call your representatives (that’s better than sending a mail, as a phone call can hardly be ignored). Go on the streets and protest against changes and for improvements <em>for you as a user</em>. Support campaigns of civil rights organizations trying to change the laws.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Maintainers who host their projects on large proprietary platforms like GitHub or GitLab’s cloud offering should always have a strategy for such situations. They should set up mirrors of the code proactively. Backing up metadata is significantly harder (especially if platforms don’t provide import/export tools, which most of the big ones do not). Some people use the project import features in tools like <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a>, but as those are one-off features, one would have to repeat the process every now and then. For the issues, there is an experimental tool called <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug">git-bug</a>, which allows offline backups and migrations, and comes with bridges to import and export to a variety of tools (and is <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug#help-needed">looking for contributors</a> to add new bridges and extend the functionality).</p>
<p>It looks like the free software community should prepare themselves better in the future. We should develop better tools to back up our metadata, also allowing us to move between platforms more easily.
If GitHub wants to remain the most popular hosting platform, they should consider adding such functionality out of the box (ideally in a standardized format). Offering such functionality doesn’t mean that projects would just leave for other platforms automatically. It would rather show that GitHub is really committed to the idea of open-source software, whose development can take place everywhere. After all, we are the ones who helped GitHub become the number one platform for software development in the world.</p>
<p>There is one thing that has been and is always going to be counterproductive, especially in such situations: blind actionism. Many people flooded the Internet (read: forums, Reddit, bug trackers of projects), inciting panic and suggesting to move to some other “free” hosted platform. This is clearly not a solution. Any hosting platform will sooner or later have to comply with such a request. It can become very expensive if you end up in court. The true solution, as we have seen in this situation, is to stay calm, analyze the situation, assess the threat to your own project and remove code and text that could be abused to justify such a request (e.g., if you are developing a similar project and also use such songs in a unit test, you can change your test to content under free licenses). Moving to another platform does not solve the root issue, and …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

Since its 1.0 release in 2015, it has been one of the most loved programming languages with a loyal following of developers and contributors.</p><p>To learn why this language is favored so much between developers, we have started a new series on Rust in production. In it, we’ll interview people that have used Rust for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs, and others.</p><p>For the first installment of the series, we interview Michael Fey, VP of Engineering at <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. Read further to find out why they chose Rust for their product, the benefits of Rust for security-centered applications, and what cool libraries you should look into if you’re developing something similar in Rust.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>1Password is a password manager trusted by millions of people and 70,000 businesses to secure their sensitive data. It remembers all your passwords so you don’t have to, and comes with apps for all major browsers, plus desktop and mobile.</p><p>I am the VP of Engineering for Client Apps here at 1Password. If you have ever had the pleasure to use 1Password on your Mac, Windows PC, iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or tablet, or in your browser, then you’ve been lucky enough to use something my team has built. We’ve been around since 2004, and we take a lot of pride in building a well-crafted experience and keeping people safe online.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/xa/xarnasmy.111_(5).jpg" alt="Michael Fey" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="can-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-1password%3F-how-big-a-part-of-your-codebase-is-written-in-rust%3F">Can you talk about the stack of 1Password? How big a part of your codebase is written in Rust?</h3><p>We’ve been using Rust in production at 1Password for a few years now. Our Windows team was the frontrunner on this effort to the point where about 70% of 1Password 7 for Windows is written in Rust. We also ported the 1Password Brain – the engine that powers our browser filling logic – from Go to Rust at the end of 2019 so that we could take advantage of the speed and performance of deploying Rust to WebAssembly in our browser extension.</p><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p><h3 id="did-any-of-rust%E2%80%99s-advantages-like-speed-or-type%2Fmemory-safety-influence-the-choice-of-using-rust-for-1password%3F">Did any of Rust’s advantages like speed or type/memory-safety influence the choice of using Rust for 1Password?</h3><p>One of the main things that drew us to Rust initially was the memory safety; it definitely excites us knowing that Rust helps us maximize our confidence in the safety of our customers’ secrets. Beyond memory safety, though, there’s so much more we love about the Rust ecosystem. There is a significant performance benefit to the lack of a traditional runtime; we don’t have to worry about the overhead of a garbage collector, for instance. Rust offers a form of “program correctness” and many guarantees against undefined behaviour at runtime. The strong type system enforces these rules at compile-time. Carefully aligning application logic with Rust’s strong type rules makes APIs difficult to use incorrectly and results in simpler code that’s free from runtime checking of constraints and invariants; the compiler can guarantee there are no invalid runtime code paths that will lead your program astray before it executes. Having to perform less runtime state validation leads to cleaner, more efficient, more focused, and higher quality code. Rust requires very little runtime debugging compared to other languages. If it compiles, you can be fairly sure it won’t exhibit unexpected behaviour. It may not be what you <em>want</em> but it will be “correct”. 🙂</p><p>Another very powerful (and often overlooked) feature of Rust is its procedural macro system, which has allowed us to write a tool that automatically shares types defined in Rust with our client-side languages (Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript). The output from this tool handles the serialization/deserialization process automatically, meaning our client-side devs can continue to work in their language of choice while interacting with the Rust library and can be free from the concerns of JSON parsing over the foreign function interface (FFI). We get all of this while enjoying the benefits of compile-time type checking in every one of our target languages. We’ve integrated this tool into our continuous integration server as well, meaning that changes to the Rust models can result in compilation failures in the client applications that are caught during our review process.</p><p>This tool has been an integral component in our development process, allowing us to move much more quickly than ever before. Once our types are defined in Rust, we are able to immediately generate equivalent types in our client-side languages. This allows our devs to focus on solving problems without having to hand-roll boilerplate code to communicate over the FFI.</p><h3 id="how-good-is-rust%E2%80%99s-support-(library-and-otherwise)-for-developing-security-centric-applications-like-1password%3F">How good is Rust’s support (library and otherwise) for developing security-centric applications like 1Password?</h3><p>There is more than enough to build a majority of the base that security-centered applications require. There are two large, prominent cryptography platforms (<em><a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">ring</a></em> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">Rust Crypto</a> group) that together provide a wealth of functionality. As I mentioned above, writing with Rust itself gives you much greater confidence in your memory usage and makes it much harder to accidentally introduce a memory-related exploit into your application. There is also a wonderful system in place for keeping track of vulnerabilities that do show up from time to time in Rust crates: the <a href="https://rustsec.org/">RustSec</a> database, which is community-sourced by other Rust developers and is updated frequently with new information that can be consumed in CI audit scans. The batteries-included test framework that Rust and Cargo also include mean that you always have an easy way to write unit-test suites for correct behavior in critical code, like any cryptographic functions that you write.</p><p>While safe native Rust libraries for everything are the dream (and they will come in time), there is always the option to dip down and easily consume something in C or from native platform libraries. We use this to great effect in our Rust code for things like calling out to the native implementations of biometric unlock (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) and platform-specific settings implementations like NSUserDefaults on Apple platforms.</p><h3 id="any-particular-rust-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Any particular Rust libraries that you want to feature?</h3><p>Absolutely. Tokio, Hyper/Reqwest, Ring, and Neon all have a home in 1Password and are fundamental in allowing us to tackle this ambitious project at all. You should also check out our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/password-rules-parser">password-rules-parser</a> on <a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, which is based on a spec primarily being backed by Apple. Their tools and docs can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/">here</a>.</p><h3 id="where-is-rust-great-to-use%2C-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Rust great to use, and where does it fall short in your stack?</h3><p>Rust has fulfilled 90% of what we were hoping for when we started this project. We’ve been able to deploy it to nearly every one of our target platforms in some way shape or form (with the exception of Apple Watch). The language itself has been designed with modern sensibilities and is improving with every release. It has great documentation and an active community.</p><p>Although there are countless crates available for use, we did have to roll our own logging and tracing tools to ensure that they were safe to use in 1Password. Additionally, we constructed a substantial localization implementation to meet the requirements of our products.</p><p>It did fall short for us in one key area: We were hoping WebAssembly would take us further in the browser and our browser extension than it has. WebAssembly has been great as a function library, but attempting to stand up an entire runtime in WASM has been a challenge. Many of the issues we ran into, however, were not limitations of Rust but of WebAssembly as a deployment platform.</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-1password-with-rust%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing 1Password with Rust?</h3><p>Many of the folks on our team were new to Rust, and they experienced the typical learning curve that comes with its memory management and ownership model. We are also finding the compile times to be pretty beefy; our CPUs and fans are definitely getting a workout. 😄</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Absolutely.</p><p>If you’re new to Rust, start small and build on top of that. We ran a large number of experiments when we were getting started to try and find the edges of what a Rust-based solution could provide. When your experiments pan out, try to reimagine the ways you used to work with other languages and see if your code can benefit from Rust’s philosophy.</p><p>If you’re new to 1Password, you can <a href="https://start.1password.com/sign-up/plan?c=1PCORE2021">sign up today with this link</a> and save 50% off your first year for family and individual accounts.

      <h3 id="soul-a-new-language-now-in-v10-makes-audio-coding-vastly-more-accessible">SOUL, a new language now in V1.0, makes audio coding vastly more accessible</h3>

<h5 id="january-20-2021">January 20, 2021</h5>

<p>London — Today’s release of SOUL, the new universal language for audio applications, will dramatically lower barriers and expand access for developers creating any apps that depend on audio, as well as providing a more efficient architecture for audio processing.</p>

<p>SOUL has reached version 1.0 status with its language, compiler, and “SOUL patch” format all stable, tested, and ready to use in a wide variety of audio-related projects.. The team, led by JUCE and Tracktion creator Julian Storer, is already at work on an array of other SOUL tools including a visual editor and a developer portal.</p>

<p>“SOUL will revolutionize audio app development, eliminating challenges that have impeded developers for too long,” said Julian Storer, Head of Software Architecture at ROLI. “The need for a radical rethink of how audio apps are made has only become more urgent since I started the SOUL project in 2016. I’m tremendously excited about the V1.0 released today and the additional tools to come.”</p>

<p>Both a programming language and a platform for creating audio plugins and apps, SOUL will solve four fundamental problems facing audio developers today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easy to learn and use: C++, the standard language for audio app coding, is extremely difficult to learn. The SOUL language is much simpler and more intuitive. Browser-based tools and fast live testing make it even easier to use and master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More secure: Sandboxing untrusted third-party code adds performance overheads that are a particular problem for audio coding. SOUL uses an intermediate assembly language called HEART that is safe to run without sandboxing, making SOUL code far more secure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimized for power and performance: CPU-intensive power consumption is a constant problem for developers. The SOUL language is far more efficient. It is specifically designed for performance, with its JIT engine matching an equivalent program written in native C++.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Achieves lowest latency: Latency in audio apps is another deep-rooted issue that to date is solved by running audio on dedicated audio hardware. SOUL unlocks ultra-low latency on devices without the need for embedded CPUs and DSPs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since debuting SOUL at ADC 2018, the team has continuously welcomed feedback through the open-source repository at https://soul.dev. This feedback has helped SOUL reach its V1.0 state today.</p>

<p>The SOUL team encourages developers to explore the language on soul.dev, read the documentation on the SOUL repository on Github, and give more feedback as the SOUL toolset continues to grow this year.</p>

  <section>
    <p>One of the advantages of QWidgets when building a Qt application is
the ability to build in a simple way custom widgets with the QPainter
API. This gives the Qt developer almost total freedom to implement
complex geometries for their widgets.</p>
<p>On the other hands, QML contains by default only rectangles. These
rectangles can change the radius to create circles and rounded rectangles, but more
complex shapes are more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-custom-geometry-in-qtquick">The current state of custom geometry in QtQuick</h2>
<p>Fortunally, the Qt API provides multiple ways to implement custom shapes,
that depending on the needs might be enough.</p>
<p>There is the Canvas API using the same API as the <code>canvas</code> API on the web but
in QML. It’s easy to use but very slow and I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
<p>Instead of the Canvas API, from the QML side, there is the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-shapes-shape.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QtQuick Shapes module</a>.
This module allows creating more complex shapes directly from the QML
with a straightforward declarative API. In many cases, this is good enough
for the application developer but this module doesn’t offer a public C++
API.</p>
<p>If you need more controls, using C++ will be required to implement custom
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickitem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickItem</a>. Unfortunately drawing
on the GPU using QQuickItem is more
complex than the QPainter API. You can’t just use commands like <code>drawRect</code>,
but will need to convert all your shapes in triangles first. This involves
a lot of maths like it can be seen in the example from the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-scenegraph-customgeometry-example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official documentation</a> or from
<a href="https://www.kdab.com/efficient-custom-shapes-in-qt-quick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the KDAB tutorial (Efficient custom shapes in Qt Quick)</a>.</p>
<p>A QPainer way is also available with <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickpainteditem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickPaintedItem</a>,
but it is slow because it renders your shape in a textured rectangle in the
Scene Graph.</p>
<h2 id="the-rusty-way">The Rusty way</h2>
<p>What if we could transform arbitrary shapes into triangles? We would get a
high level API but still get great performance. This process is called tessellation
and there are a few libraries that implement it. For example in C++, we
have Skia and CGAL. Unfortunatelly, both aren’t easy to use, so I decided to look
at the Rust library ecosystem and in particular at <a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyon</a>,
which was designed with performance and compliance to the SVG standard in mind
since the goal is to use it in Servo in the future.</p>
<p>Lyon doesn’t have any C++ bindings but I got inspired by the recent
<a href="https://jbbgameich.github.io/misc/2020/12/21/rust-in-a-kde-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post from Jonah</a>
and I need to say the experience of writing bindings was a breeze.</p>
<p>The first step was creating wrapper <code>struct</code>s around the
Lyon primitives. <code>LyonPoint</code>, <code>LyonGeometry</code> and <code>LyonBuilder</code> will
later be directly usable from the C++ side.</p>

For example, there is an abstraction that allows to draw circle, ellipse, rounded

<p>There is also the possibility to add custom attributes for texture coordinate

    <p>
      SymQEMU: Compilation-based symbolic execution for binaries
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the Network and Distributed System Symposium (NDSS 2021),
    San Diego, CA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software analysis and bug
      detection. Compilation-based symbolic execution is a recently proposed
      flavor that has been shown to improve the performance of symbolic
      execution significantly when source code is available. We demonstrate a
      novel technique to enable compilation-based symbolic execution of binaries
      (i.e., without the need for source code). Our system, SymQEMU, builds on
      top of QEMU, modifying the intermediate representation of the target
      program before translating it to the host architecture. This enables
      SymQEMU to compile symbolic-execution capabilities into binaries and reap
      the associated performance benefits while maintaining architecture
      independence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We present our approach and implementation, and we show that it
      outperforms the state-of-the-art binary symbolic executors S2E and QSYM
      with statistical significance; on some benchmarks, it even achieves better
      performance than the source-based SymCC. Moreover, our tool has found a
      previously unknown vulnerability in the well-tested libarchive library,
      demonstrating its utility in testing real-world software.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is a fast symbolic execution engine for binaries. On this page, we
    provide its source code, the raw results of the experiments described in the
    paper, and instructions how you can replicate those experiments yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symqemu">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe three sets of experiments: we first benchmark
    SymQEMU with Google FuzzBench, then we run it on real-world software, and
    finally we perform a benchmark comparison during concolic execution of fixed
    paths. This section describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides
    links to our results.

        We will share our integration scripts shortly; they're being cleaned up

      <p>
        For the analysis of real-world software we used the same setup as in the
        <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/symcc.html">evaluation of SymCC</a>. The binaries for SymQEMU,
        QSYM and S2E were plain builds without any instrumentation. SymQEMU was
        run via SymCC's fuzzing helper by prefixing the target command
        with <tt>/path/to/symqemu-x86_64</tt>. For the S2E analysis, we created
        a default project, then enabled the <tt>FunctionModels</tt> plugin and
        activated the option <tt>generateOnStateFork</tt> in
        the <tt>TestCaseGenerator</tt> plugin; coverage was evaluated
        with <tt>afl-showmap</tt> at the end of the analysis, using the same
        AFL-instrumented binaries as with the hybrid fuzzers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            

<div id="introduction">
<h2><a href="#id8">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Back in 2018, we compared empirically the performance overheads of Go
and C++ with regards to the low-level calling convention: to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">pass
arguments</a>,
to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">return multiple values</a>, and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">when propagating exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>Those results were obtained with Go 1.10 and Clang 6.0. Since then,
compilers have evolved and we are now running with Go 1.15 and Clang
11.0. Have the findings changed since&nbsp;then?</p>
<p>The question of interest&nbsp;was:</p>
<blockquote>
What is cheaper: handling exceptions via <code>panic</code> / <code>recover</code>, or
passing and testing error results with <code>if err := <span>...;</span> err != nil {
return err }</code>?</blockquote>
<p>In fact, as we will see below, the conclusions are stronger today than
they were two years&nbsp;ago.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology">
<h2><a href="#id9">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>The reader is first invited to familiarize themselves with the
discussion of Go’s low-level calling convention as compared with C++’s
in the previous chapters of this series: <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64.html">as of 2018</a> and <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64-2020.html">as of 2020</a>. The 2018
analysis is still largely valid in 2020—the C++ calling convention did
not change, and Go introduced a few optimizations on the
implementation of <code>defer</code>.</p>
<p>There were three analyses&nbsp;previously:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to measure argument passing and returning multiple values, we will
use exactly the same methodology as the previous two analyses <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>These analyses contain their benchmark source code, which is also
provided at <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2018-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a>. The
derivation of plots was entirely automated via <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>,
which we can thus&nbsp;re-run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>for the <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">third analysis</a>,
which measures and compares the cost of error returns with that of
throwing and catching exceptions, we are going to reuse the same
methodology, but a diffence source code for the benchmark. The new
source code has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2020-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a> as
well. This difference is motivated&nbsp;below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also use an upgraded benchmark system, configured as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CPU</span>: <span>AMD</span> Ryzen 7 3950X 3700.07MHz Family=0x17 Model=0x71&nbsp;Stepping=0</li>
<li><span>OS</span>: FreeBSD 13.0-<span>CURRENT</span>&nbsp;r366805</li>
<li>go version 1.15.5&nbsp;freebsd/amd64</li>
<li>C++ FreeBSD clang version 11.0.0&nbsp;(llvmorg-11.0.0-0-g176249bd673)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="experimental-results">
<h2><a href="#id10">Experimental&nbsp;results</a></h2>
<p>All the generated data files and Jupyter notebooks <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/notebook.zip">can be downloaded
here</a>.</p>
<div id="findings-for-argument-passing-and-returning-multiple-values">
<h3><a href="#id11">Findings for argument passing and returning multiple&nbsp;values</a></h3>
<p>Here the findings are largely unchanged from 2018: for the selected
benchmark code, the code generation by our selected compilers has not
changed&nbsp;significantly.</p>
<p>Only the new hardware <span>CPU</span> influences the measurements: the new <span>CPU</span> has
a higher clock frequency than previously, so for an equivalent
mix of instructions we expect and observe a 10-40% raw performance
improvement. Additionally, the Ryzen 7 3950X architecture has a
somewhat more powerful superscalar execution unit than the 1800X, and
is able to detect inter-instruction dependencies across more memory
accesses. This causes more measurements artifacts when the workload is
extremely small, and erases the performance differences between 1 and
5 function arguments or return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>The main conclusions thus remain&nbsp;unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go uses memory to pass function arguments and return values. This
makes Go code perform about twice slower than equivalent C++ code on
function calls, where C++ compilers use register-based calling
conventions&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>The particular <span>CPU</span> we used this year uses a micro-architecture able
to more aggressively optimize memory-heavy code, and so the Go
performance overhead relative to C++ is erased for very small
functions; unfortunately, these optimizations become ineffective with
more realistic, wider function&nbsp;bodies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Go, memory is used for return values even when there is just one
or two words worth of data. In these cases, a C++ compiler also
typically uses registers. This choice in the Go compiler is
unfortunate, as it mandates copying the return values through memory
at every call level when functions return each other’s value in a
cascade. This cost thus multiplies the overhead of the memory-based
return by the call depth, in a way that does not occur, or much
less, with a typical C++ code&nbsp;generator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As previously, we can discuss what is the proportion of function
calls relative to other types of code. Arguably, in
computation-heavy algorithms, functions often get inlined so that calls
disappear. In that case, it is possible for the Go compiler,
assisted by the <span>CPU</span> micro-architecture, to reach similar instruction
throughputs as the equivalent C++&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>However, we can also point out that Go still promotes the use of
dynamic dispatch (via interface methods) as an idiomatic approach to
software design. For example, string composition via
<code>bytes.Buffer</code> interfaces with the <code>fmt</code> packages using
interface calls (<code>io.Writer</code>), and the proportion of
cross-interface calls is relatively high in that case compared to
the computation&nbsp;load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reader is invited to review the more detailed summaries from the
previous analyses, where the situation is presented in more&nbsp;detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="measuring-errors-vs-panics-reminder-and-code-tweak">
<h3><a href="#id12">Measuring errors vs panics: reminder and code&nbsp;tweak</a></h3>
<p>This analysis calls for a benchmark which performs a “unit of work” in
a loop, with the size of the loop configurable as&nbsp;“workload”.</p>
<p>We are modeling the extremely common case where any error inside a
unit of work aborts the entire workload: the error may or may not be
generated inside the unit of work, but needs only be detected once for
the entire outer workload&nbsp;loop.</p>
<p>In Go, we originally used the following code as&nbsp;benchmark:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this code, <code>leafErr</code> represents the “unit of work”, where errors
can originate. The <code>workErr</code> represents the main work computation,
where <code>leafErr</code> is called&nbsp;repeatedly.</p>
<p>(The <code>go:noinline</code> annotation is explained in more detail in the previous&nbsp;analysis.)</p>
<p>In the case where the <code>error</code> return is used, we need to check the
<code>err</code> return on every iteration of the loop. If we used exception
instead, we could factor the exception check out of the&nbsp;loop:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Exception check factored out of the loop:</span>
  <span>defer</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>recover</span><span>();</span> <span>r</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}()</span>
  <span>// Main workload follows:</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>errObj</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(The accompanying C++ code is implemented similarly, using
<code><span>std::tuple</span></code> for error returns and <code>try/catch/throw</code> for&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>Just looking at the shape of the source code, we can already suspect
the findings that follow: there is less work inside the workload loop
when using exceptions. So as the workload increases, the cost of
setting up the “catch” logic gets&nbsp;amortized.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is exactly what was observed in 2018. (<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html#summary-and-conclusions">Summary and
conclusions
here.</a>)</p>
<p>However, when running the same experiment in 2020 on our new test
machine, with Go 1.15, the measurements are all over the place, the
results appear chaotic, and the difference we observed last time is
nearly entirely erased. What&nbsp;happened?</p>
<p>It turns out that the new <span>CPU</span> used to run the benchmark really has a
much better micro-architecture. It is able to peek through the call
from the <code>work</code> function to the <code>leaf</code> function, analyze
inter-instruction dependencies across the call, and fully pipeline the
processing of the <code>leaf</code> function across multiple iterations of the
<code>work</code> loop. This effectively invalidates the model we used: in a
realistic application, there is enough complexity in the code inside
the “workload”, when it contains function calls, that the <span>CPU</span> cannot
pipeline loop&nbsp;iterations.</p>
<p>To restore a valid model, we should thus tweak the benchmark program
by adding just enough additional complexity in the “unit of
work”. Here, we achieve that by adding just one extra level of
intermediate&nbsp;call:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>

  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>intermediateErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(Likewise for the benchmark using&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>This program, at least on the <span>CPU</span> considered, is “complex” enough to
stop the superscalar unit from peeking across the function call. The
resulting code then behaves regularly in&nbsp;measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="findings-for-error-returns-vs-exceptions">
<h3><a href="#id13">Findings for error returns vs&nbsp;exceptions</a></h3>
<p>The Jupiter notebook for this experiment contains the data processing steps
and the logic to generate comparison plots, with some detailed analysis
of the intermediate&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>The key result is the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/err-comparison.png"></p><p>What we see&nbsp;here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For an equivalent workload (e.g. 1000 “units of work”), the Go code
is 40% slower than the equivalent C++ code. This is generally
expected as Go is much more memory-heavy than&nbsp;C++.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regardless of the language considered, the cost of setting up an
exception “catch” can be reliably amortized across an entire
workload: the performance of code using exception-based error
reporting asymptotically converges to become the same as code using
no error handling&nbsp;whatsoever.</p>
<p>In comparison, code that propagates errors as return values is
systematically slower as the workload increases; between 1-3% for
C++, up to 4-10% for&nbsp;Go.</p>
<p>This is one of the two main&nbsp;results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The cost of setting up an exception “catch” is not entirely
negligible. Back in 2018, the mandatory fixed cost of the <code>defer</code>
setup and testing <code>recover()</code> in the <code>work</code> function was 50ns;
such that it took about 500 nanoseconds worth of “workload” to fully
offset this one-time&nbsp;cost.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>

    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft

expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption.
