<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Be a creator, not just a consumer<br></h2><p>I sit down every weekend to write. It’s a routine I’ve deliberately cultivated for myself during this year as a way to get out of my own head and put my thoughts on (metaphorical) paper. </p><p>It started with this post on cultivating a <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/daily-writing-habit" target="_blank">daily writing habit</a>, which I moved away from after <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/writing-25-blog-posts-in-25-days" target="_blank">25 days</a> into a weekly schedule.</p><p>Some of my writings go out as tweet threads, others as blog posts on this site. Invariably, I am creating and publishing week after week.</p><p>It's not just to achieve end goal (follow systems, not goals) that I write every week. I thoroughly enjoy the process of creation, the act of sitting with lo-fi or synthwave tunes in the background and punching away at the keyboard brain dumping onto a notepad.</p><p>I’ve managed to get <a href="https://www.sankalpjonna.com/all-posts" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> (my co-founder) onto writing as well. He’s still working out a schedule that helps him create and publish good content consistently, but he’s started walking the treadmill which is the important part.</p><p>Recently I’ve been engaging with my team at DelightChat to get into a regular publishing routine. <a href="https://www.akashj.com/" target="_blank">Akash</a> already writes occasionally, Deb published his podcast on <a href="https://saascontentatscale.com/" target="_blank">SaaS content marketing</a>, and Niraj is setting up his blog as we speak.</p><p>However, I didn’t want to be some old fart, a preacher who is saying “get on the horse” without explaining the why.</p><p>So here goes.<br></p><h2>Reasons to write</h2><p>Before proceeding further, I must make one thing clear. While I personally prefer writing, the message here is to create stuff. </p><p>Create art, design album covers, shoot vlogs, record podcasts, write code. The focus is on creation, and becoming a creator in a world where most people are only consuming.</p><p>Here’s how I explained the importance of writing and being a creator to my team.</p><p>The whole world and everything in it, people and entities, are connected by invisible strings. You can visualise it like a web, an interconnected web with billions of points. </p><p>Yes, I’m describing the model of the internet. Yes it’s more relevant than ever, because until recently majority of the world wasn’t online and connected to each other. With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/" target="_blank">4.57 billion</a> people on the internet, we are literally living in the interconnected web. And hence it’s important for you to visualise and grasp the enormity of it.</p><p>Back to reasons.</p><p>You can take this giant web of interconnected beings and entities, and splice it in any direction you want. And you always end up with a subset of people. </p><figure id="w-node-5239bfbcbdf9-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f817d2c1f8d6ba3787fa59e_node%20network%20map%20of%20the%20internet.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>A map of the internet. Which cross-section will you splice?</em></figcaption></figure><p>Example of a large splice - people who enjoy listening to music.</p><p>Example of a smaller splice - people who enjoy alternative rock music.</p><p>Even smaller splice - people who enjoy alternative rock and compose tracks and sing in a band in the same genre.</p><p>You can take this concept and apply it to any idea and pull at the strings.</p><p>With this blog post, I’m pulling at the strings that connect people who want to create stuff, have the ability to create stuff, and want to get started but haven’t yet. More specifically, my blog might appeal to people who have the ability and desire to write.</p><p>Anyway, now you have identified a splice or subset. What next?</p><p>The question really becomes, how do you make yourself a valuable entity in a given subset or splice of this giant interconnected web? How do you become a valuable node.</p><p>And there’s only one answer to it.</p><p>The only way to become a valuable node is by pushing/publishing/releasing value into the web. But like an ocean, a drop won’t be noticed by anybody. You need a pond where you can make a splash. </p><p>You need to narrow down and focus on a small enough splice, such that when you tug at its strings, you have a real chance to get noticed. That way the value that you create in the form of written, video, audio, code, etc about topics that your narrow splice of the web cares about has a chance of earning their attention.</p><p>There is no other way. It’s not going to be easy. Many others are trying to grab the same splice of attention. </p><p>But, life is not a zero sum game. </p><p>Multiple people can win. You can win too.</p><p>And that’s brings me to the #1 reason to write or create stuff.</p><p><strong>You can’t win if you don’t participate.</strong><br></p><h2>Common obstacles to writing</h2><p>From my conversations with people, I’ve found the most common obstacles to be</p><ol role="list"><li>You don’t know why to write or create stuff</li><li>You don’t know what to write about</li><li>You don’t have a schedule or consistency</li><li>Procrastination (the human mind is marvelous)</li></ol><p>I’ve already solved the first problem by explaining the why. <br></p><h3>Create a consistent writing schedule</h3><p>The third problem can be solved by committing to a schedule. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/scale" target="_blank">James Clear</a> published on Mondays and Thursdays for three years until his blog finally took off. The rest we already know about. </p><p>I committed to a daily writing schedule at first, which was hard but it helped me get out of my rut. This commitment was made in public and to my girlfriend in person. </p><p>The two factors combined pushed me enough to get over my mental barriers and keep writing daily, especially on days I didn’t feel like. Back then I was writing shorter posts, which I’ve traded for longer thought pieces once a week.</p><p>You too can set a simple but achievable routine. </p><p>Set a reminder on Fridays to think of a topic to create about, spend a few hours on Saturday punching the keyboard furiously until you’ve dumped all your thoughts on paper, and then edit it before hitting publish on Sunday. </p><p>The DelightChat team has a recurring event on the calendar to help maintain a consistent creator schedule.</p><figure id="w-node-1e110a69cf8d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f81679d2365946712414656_consistent%20writing%20schedule%20write%20weekly.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Remember to set a target that’s easy enough to achieve. You’re not aiming for the pulitzer prize, you are trying to create a habit that’s super easy to do, thereby reducing chances of failure.</p><h3>Overcome writing procrastination</h3><p>Here are a few common procrastination arrows your brain is going to shoot at you. I’m going to make you aware of them so you can dodge them. <br></p><p><strong>“I don’t have time to write.”</strong></p><p>Create a schedule, commit to it, tell your friends, family or someone who will ask you and therefore hold you accountable.<br></p><p><strong>“I don’t know what to write about.”</strong></p><p>I’ve answered that in the next section.<br></p><p><strong>“Ding! New notification from WhatsApp.”</strong></p><p>Pour oil on your phone, throw it in the dustbin, and light it on fire.</p><p>Or, you could put it on silent and place it exactly behind your laptop screen (out of eyesight). Has served me well.</p><p><strong>"I don't have something interesting to say. I only want to write if I have something unique to say."</strong></p><p>You are a unique person with a unique perspective and thoughts about life due to your unique circumstances and upbringing and the hundreds and thousands of experiences you've had up until now.</p><p>You have something unique to say. The topic might be old (it always is), but your unique perspective, your anecdotal experience, all add up.<br></p><p><strong>“But I need to setup my blog, set up markdown, and more.”</strong></p><p>No, you need to write. Writing is the goal, not integrating markdown.<br></p><p><strong>“But the text editor I use isn’t friendly. It doesn’t integrate with my blog.”</strong></p><p>Google Keep or Apple Notes works perfectly and is very distraction free. </p><p>Blow up the font size until you can’t see anything else on the screen. It’s what I do and it works.</p><p>Your real challenge, and the only one that matters is sitting down and penning your thoughts, or creating stuff. You can do it on a piece of paper (but do it on Google Keep or Apple Notes, seriously).<br></p><p><strong>“But should I publish on Medium, on Substack, how do I format it into a tweet thread, etc.”</strong></p><p>The medium can come later. The medium is a constraint. </p><p>Constraints can be walked around of using creativity. But it's not a limiting factor by any means. </p><p><strong>Your goal is to write or create.</strong><br></p><p>There is no perfect moment, the right time to start, or a sign from the universe where you suddenly kick procrastination in the face and get started. There is only the here and now.</p><figure id="w-node-3259c2c4fa4e-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f8275f05451d7829eeee560_beat%20procrastination%20there%20is%20no%20sign%20from%20the%20universe.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Photo by </em><a href="https://unsplash.com/@austinchan" target="_blank"><em>Austin Chan</em></a><em> </em></figcaption></figure><p>Hopefully these prompts I've written will help you dodge your brain’s procrastination bullets.<br></p><h2>What to write about</h2><p>Throughout the week I gather ideas on what to write about </p><ul role="list"><li>from conversations with my co-founder, team and other people, </li><li>by observing what others have written about and if I have a perspective to share, </li><li>thoughts circling in my head, </li></ul><p>and so on..</p><p>There’s infinite sources for gathering ideas, but it’s important to have an eye for catching ideas (similar to how one can train themselves to spot business or startup ideas). </p><p>And it's equally important to jot down those ideas somewhere safe and easy to access.</p><p>I have a private WhatsApp group to drop ideas whenever I have them.</p><figure id="w-node-3fbdec9be5eb-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f8166d013df6c908d268c79_writing%20ideas%20store%20in%20whatsapp%20group.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Sankalp was facing a problem with coming up with topics to write about.

<![CDATA[Creating a Slack app that uses fewer resources]]>

  <p>
  I recently created a macOS app called Slack Lite, which beats Slack's desktop app across a few performance metrics.
  Slack Lite uses Slack's official UI, so it's visually indistinguishable from the official client.
  Even so, Slack Lite uses 5x fewer threads, 3.5x less time to startup, and significantly less CPU.
  In the Activity Monitor screenshots below, you can see the raw numbers (Slack Lite's processes are highlighted):
</p>

Slack Helper, CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 9.
Slack Helper (GPU), CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 8.
Highlighted: Slack Lite, CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 5.

Table from Activity Monitor's Memory tab:
Highlighted: https://app.slack.com, Memory: 262.4 MB.

Slack, Memory: 62.8 MB.
Slack Helper (GPU), Memory: 49.7 MB.
Highlighted: Slack Lite, Memory: 24.1 MB.
Slack Helper, Memory: 12.4 MB.
">

<blockquote>
    Edit: this post previously claimed that Slack Lite used 1.2x less memory, but the numbers in the screenshots do not support that claim.
    I retook the screenshots between drafts of this post, and I suspect that's how I introduced that error.
    In practice, the memory difference is negligible.
  </blockquote>


<p>
  It's time to come clean: the performance differences described in this post are not really inherent to Slack Lite.
  I suspect you could get similar numbers by applying this Slack Lite approach to any Electron-based macOS app.
  Slack Lite is a <a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/multi">Multi</a> app, which means it's using a WebKit WebView behind the scenes.
  Ultimately, the numbers above are a proxy for the Chrome vs. Safari comparison.
</p>

<p>
  I'm neither a performance engineer nor a desktop application engineer, but the Slack Lite approach just <em>feels right</em> to me.
  If I already have a browser engine built into my operating system, why should application developers ship a different one for use with their "native" app?
  Especially if that application is a minimal wrapper for an existing web application.
  I know that the answer circles around developer productivity, but to me the "state of the art" still feels off.
  I also know that other folks are thinking about this tension!
  Here's a neat demo from Twitter via <a href="https://twitter.com/nateparrott/status/1275829708354211840" rel="external">@nateparrott</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Here's another experiment we built at <a href="https://twitter.com/browsercompany" rel="external">@browsercompany</a>: "Launcher." Half the apps I use are web apps, and half are macOS apps. What if they behaved the same? (1/5)
    <video src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/EbSmCcZWAAES5EK.mp4" autoplay="" muted="" controls="" loop="" alt="Screen recording of a macOS app called Launcher. It appears to work much like Spotlight or Alfred, except that once an item is \" launched\",="" it="" becomes="" a="" full="" macos="" app="" with="" new="" window="" and="" dockbar="" entry."="">
    </video>
  </blockquote>


<p>
  Perhaps the most exciting part of this experiment is that I created the Slack Lite in <a href="https://kofi.sexy/slack-app-fewer-resources/demo.mp4">30 seconds</a>.
  As I mentioned above, Slack Lite is a Multi app.
  I built Multi specifically for this use case: quickly creating a lightweight macOS app from any group of websites.
  If that approach <em>feels right</em> to you as well, I hope you take a moment to try out Multi, which is open-source and available on GitHub:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>A few days ago I had an idea for a silly skit that I would post on TikTok. I spent about 5-10 minutes filming it with no script or plan and posted it on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shmemmmy/video/6880323857903799558?source=h5_m">my TikTok</a> and my <a href="https://twitter.com/EmilyKager/status/1313303791186268160?s=20">Twitter</a>. I went to bed and in the morning was awoken to messages from my friends and acquaintances that I was suddenly on the front page of Reddit.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0dpllvD.png" alt="My video on the front page of reddit" width="400px">
</p>

<p>I was excited about going viral and initially happy that people were liking my silly little video, but of course, as a woman with her face and body suddenly in front of millions of people, that faded quickly.</p>

<p>The video was shared on a programming humor subreddit (without attribution I might add), but my annoyance and fear wasn’t in the missed clout or internet points, but it was that I lost control of being able to delete the post, delete comments, or block commenters when it was posted on a new platform.</p>

<p>Here’s just a small example of the comments that started streaming in</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pYyqNRq.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BsaeIjB.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BOXJoSG.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">
</p>

<p>And how did this impact me personally? While the video was going viral, I felt like prey and couldn’t focus. I knew people were watching, judging, possibly trying to find me elsewhere on the internet to harass me in real-time. I started getting notifications people were trying to log in to my internet accounts. I locked everything down with 2FA (which I should have had anyway). My past experiences have primed me to expect the worse and feel foolish to hope for the best.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened-next">What happened next:</h3>

<p>I reported all of the terrible comments (as did friends) but ~24 hours later, almost none of them had been removed. I reached out to the moderators of the subreddit with an appeal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is my first time being posted on Reddit, and I’m a bit disappointed by the moderation here. There are clearly disgusting sexual comments directed at me and unrelated to the video content or programming humor ranging from the stupid (“boobs”) to the more troublesome - including people directing people to go to my social media to get a better look at my body parts and violent imagery about me. All of these comments I have been reporting over the past 24 hours and very few of them have been removed.</p>

  <p>I would hope you can be more vigilant about moderating these types of comments because it does not create a very welcoming environment for women in tech. The sub isn’t SexistProgrammerHumor and I am personally seeing and reading these sexualized comments about my body (as are thousands of other people including my friends, partner, acquaintances, and coworkers).</p>

  <p>I would urge you to please add a new sub rule about these types of comments if you are interested in being a more welcoming place where I would feel comfortable posting my content. Also if a woman is the subject of a viral post, these types of comments and behavior should be expected and nipped in the bud as unacceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn’t expecting much but the next day I received a response which was basically the best I could have hoped for. I do appreciate the response, and here’s to hoping this doesn’t happen on this sub again, but of course there are thousands of other subs/communities online and other women posting content still out there. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First I’d like to apologize for what happened here, this is seriously unacceptable and we really screwed up moderating this as the tread should’ve been locked way earlier. I’ve removed most if not all of the offending comments and the most egregious offenders have been permanently banned.</p>

  <p>We’re definitely going to adjust our rules to ban sexualized comments of any kind, since again any behaviour like this is unacceptable and I’m sorry we didn’t have clearer rules for this earlier.</p>

  <p>We’re also going to look into enlisting more mods, to help us better manage situations like this.</p>

  <p>We’re here to help in any way we can, so please don’t hesitate to write back if anything else is going wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure some of you have thoughts about this and I will try to address them.</p>

<h3 id="but-content-creators-should-expect-some-level-of-criticism-on-the-internet">“But content creators should expect some level of criticism on the internet”</h3>

<p>Yes, you are correct. And there were some actual “criticisms” posted that I was able to brush off easily. One example: “You can see her hand move when she is starting/pausing the filming”. And you’re right! My video editing skills for a silly TikTok I didn’t know was going to go viral were sub-par and this is a valid criticism.</p>

<p>But there’s a huge difference between a critique of the filming process and threads discussing me personally - everything about how annoying my voice is to debating my breast size (and directing people to go look at my social media to settle the debate). Whether you think these constitute valid criticisms or not, I think we can agree it will make people feel unsafe.</p>

<p>I didn’t post the video on Reddit myself for this exact reason. I find it to be a pretty toxic place for women and POC. There are places on Reddit where this commentary is allowed and even encouraged (see all the NSFW and controversial subreddits), but a programming humor subreddit allowing this is just continuing the trend of making women feel unwelcome in this industry.</p>



<p>While at first, it seems like a solid idea to ignore the haters, so to speak, first of all, if no one is reading the worst comments, we’re not reporting these things so nothing will ever change. Secondly, a discussion that starts as mild can escalate to doxxing, organized dogpiling, or threats. Not knowing that this is happening could be dangerous.  </p>

<h3 id="these-people-are-just-incels-and-the-scum-of-the-internet">“These people are just incels and the scum of the internet”</h3>

<p>When I was in college there were 2 anonymous message boards (YikYak and ACB) where students would post terribly racist and sexist things in addition to harassing individual girls at the school (not me because I wasn’t popular). It’s especially alarming to me that this was at an Ivy League school where most of these kids were raised “well” and would continue to go on to start companies, go to the best graduate programs, and be the “future leaders” of our world. And I’m sure most of these kids would have NEVER said any of those things in person, but being anonymous gives you a strange power and a weird desire to say harmful things.</p>

<p>I think people rush to dismiss these trolls as “the scum of the internet incels”, but I think that this is wrong. I think it’s way closer to home than that. I think they are Ivy League grads, fellow software engineers in SF, and people I ride the subway with. Normal people who really live normal lives in real life, but take out some internal rage online under the veil of anonymity.</p>

<p>Further, I think dismissing them as lost causes or “just trolls” minimizes the problem and gives an excuse for their behavior.</p>

<h3 id="i-know-what-some-of-you-are-still-thinking-i-agree-that-its-bad-but-when-you-put-yourself-out-there-on-the-internet-this-should-be-expected">I know what some of you are still thinking. “I agree that it’s bad, but when you put yourself out there on the internet, this should be expected”</h3>

<p>I think this is bullshit. Why should a woman have to expect to be harassed every time she puts herself out there online?</p>

<p>If somehow, you’ve made it this far as someone who has posted a nasty comment under the safety of anonymity before, I urge you to consider your words and how you are contributing to unsafe communities.</p>

<p>Platforms and their moderators can stop turning a blind eye to this type of behavior. It’s time to spend some resources, set clear rules, and enforce them. Your bottom line won’t matter if more than half of the human race feels unsafe on your platform.</p>

<p>I think we can all do better. We can call out and report this behavior as unacceptable when we see it. We can ask for and expect our communities to be held to a higher standard. I call on all of you to see and report these things. While it is not ideal that the onus is on us to take action, if we see it and don’t report it, nothing will ever change.</p>

<p>Maybe one day a woman will be able to post a silly video on the internet without fear.</p>

I strongly believe that paying for the content before consuming it is buying a pig in a poke. You can see and try a car in a dealership before you buy it. You can try on a shirt or a dress in a department store. You have to be able to read a book before paying for it.

<p>The Amiga platform has exhibited amazing longevity for something so plagued by problems. And for a platform with such problems, it's been an excruciatingly slow march to resolve matters. Amiga is still running a twenty-year old operating system on chips that haven't been updated in over eleven years, and is only able to use anything modern through emulation or as an add-on card. What other platform offers accelerator cards faster than the main CPU by a factor of ten?</p><p>Accordingly, the sorry state of Amiga lays mostly to blame in its many sponsors over the years, from Commodore to Escom to Gateway and finally to Amiga, Inc. Each and every one of these companies have fumbled the ball in directing Amiga, burying it further and further every year. Third parties have stepped in to alleviate this, but can not push the platform ahead, only offer it short-term boosts that allow applications — and not the operating system — speed-ups and modern features.</p><p>Enter QNX Software Systems, contracted by Gateway in 1997 to create a desktop operating system based on its embedded QNX Neutrino micro-kernel environment. QNX was a significant player in the embedded industry and had a reputation for efficient, real-time systems that oversaw everything from medicine drips to auto-assembly robots. It looked like such finely-honed technology would be the proper bridge to the second coming of the Amiga. Appearances, however, can be deceiving.</p><p>Work began in earnest in 1998 as QNX put the finishing touches on its new micro-kernel and brought forward Photon, its graphical windowing system. All of this was done in tight communication with Gateway's Amiga team and new hardware was readied that used Motorola-supplied PowerPC chips, the same architecture that Amiga third parties for years had used in accelerator boards. Gateway wanted out of the Microsoft/Intel duopoly. QNX continued plugging away at fever-rate.</p><p>Just as Gateways' PowerPC systems were coming along, however, something at QNX hit a snag. Gateway had readied single, dual, and quad processor machines using Motorola's PowerPC G3 and G4 chips, processors QNX had supported for years already. Just as QNX's Neutrino-based Amiga was entering alpha testing, problems crept up with the Gateway PowerPC boards and QNX was pointing the finger back at its partner. Gateway responded in kind, insisting performance problems were software-based.</p><p>At this point, in mid-1999, Gateway had been talking up its future Amiga systems and invested millions in the project as well as in Motorola, all while Intel and Microsoft were breathing down its neck, unhappy with potentially losing such an important customer. Any problems with QNX and its software were potentially crippling and Gateway insisted on a solid date for a finished QNX product. QNX balked at this, insisting its primary focus must be QNX Neutrino first, and Amiga's desktop second.</p><p>In late 1999, Gateway was in a panic as QNX remained stoic on its undelivered Amiga system, defaulted QNX on its contract, and made preparations to spin off its Amiga division into its own sovereign company, divesting itself of any further financial bleeding. Two Gateway employees took over the newly-formed Amiga, Inc. and went back to square one on producing a modern operating system. The industry once again shrugged and yawned at yet another Amiga disappointment.</p><p>In 2001, Amiga, Inc. farmed development of its next-generation operating system — now referred to as Amiga OS 4 — to AmigaOne Partners, the name for a group of third-party Amiga players. In the meantime they updated their geriatric operating system with OS 3.1, 3.5, and 3.9. Today, four years after contracting AmigaOne, the industry is still waiting for a finished product, the only tangible evidence of it being screenshots circulating news sites every few months.</p><p>QNX, meanwhile, released QNX RTOS 6.0 in late 2000 as a self-hosted development platform for Intel PC systems. They followed up every year with a new release and their system now rests at QNX Momentics 6.3, with QNX 6.4 rumored to be forthcoming. Such punctuality begs the question of why QNX couldn't have done the same for Gateway. Not a word has been said as QNX hastily removed any mention of Amiga from its products and remained tight-lipped forever after.</p><p>Other questions remain as well, such as why Gateway hadn't contracted or bought beleaguered Be, Inc. who already had a multimedia-optimized desktop operating system, dubbed by many as the Amiga's ideological successor, and had instead pursued a less-suited route. Or why Gateway hadn't sued QNX for breach of contract after QNX failed on numerous occasions to meet its contractual obligations. Or why sickly Amiga, Inc. today still waits after four years for a PowerPC operating system.</p><p>Most of these questions are left for the reader to ponder, as no answers have surfaced even after several years. Amiga users angry at the Ice Age their platform has been in can squarely blame QNX's failure to deliver a desktop as the latest hurdle in moving forward, however. For many that's more than enough reason to lay blame on QNX Software Systems as they quietly release yearly upgrades while Amiga languishes in developmental Hell.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/">Hillel Wayne</a> has a great <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/">newsletter</a>, and one recent post had this observation:</p>



<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="Mystery%20Knowledge%2C%20Workshop%20Discount" data-author="@buttondown" cite="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/mystery-knowledge-worskshop-discount/">
<p>The abstract concept here is knowledge or skills that</p>
<ol>
<li>You are unlikely to discover on your own, neither through practice and reflection nor by observing others apply it.</li>
<li>Once somebody tells you about it, you can easily learn and apply it.</li>
<li>Once you can use it, it immediately gives you significant benefits, possibly to the point of raising your expertise level. </li>
</ol>
<p>This might be a studied topic, but if it is I don’t know even what <em>field of knowledge</em> it belongs to, much less what it’s called. In the meantime I call it <strong>mystery knowledge</strong>.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I see this a lot at my job, where less experienced engineers will struggle not because they lack fundamental knowledge or are “dumb”, but because they are just not aware of the tools out there. To clarify, I am also often in the same boat, like when someone pulls out Hopper, or does magic in Hive, so I’m not saying I’m a paragon of tool enlightenment. Debugging is all about eliminating hypotheses and reducing the problem space by obtaining useful information <em>quickly</em>. Given the complexity of our systems today, obtaining information can get really difficult. Knowing which tools to reach for helps. Most of them are really easy to use, as long as you know they exist and have an idea of what they do. Consider this a living document of tooling “mystery knowledge” that I’ve built up over the years. Where possible, I’ve included examples of how I use it, to give you some sense of what to do with it. It is calibrated towards desktop applications as that is what I’ve done for most of my career. I think this is much more valuable today when a majority of developers come from a web/backend development background, where they are primarily concerned with web browsers or Linux and where desktop development is less common.</p>

<p>Tools whose names are in <code>code</code> font are command-line programs already installed on the operating system.</p>



<ol>
<li><p>Your internal code search and IDE/editor search - Reading code will almost always prove useful. Reading not just your code, but code of third party programs you use when available. It can help explain unintuitive behavior, and sometimes you might even find a bug where you don’t expect it. Semantic code search tools make it much easier to understand code.</p></li>

<li><p><code>grep</code>/<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> - A side effect of operating on text source files is you often want to quickly find terms in those source files. Both of these tools print lines matching a regular expression in the set of files passed to them. ripgrep is almost always better because it is recursive by default, can respect VCS (Version Control System) ignored files and color the output.</p></li>

<li><p><code>tail -f</code> - Another logs, logs, logs tool. Use it to tail a file live. Most often used to observe a server log while you make requests to it.</p></li>

<li><p><code>awk</code> - A full programming language for text processing. I mainly use it as a glorified <code>cut</code>. Most common use for me is to use <code>git status</code> to get a list of changed files, filter by <code>M</code> or <code>D</code> and then use <code>awk</code> to extract only the file name.</p></li>

<li><p><code>pbcopy</code> (macOS) / <code>clip</code> (Windows) - Pipe text into these commands to copy it to the system clipboard. Really useful to bridge the command-line &lt;-&gt; GUI gap when you want to send command output to someone via Slack or add it to a doc.</p></li>
</ol>



<p>One of the fun parts of being a desktop developer is routinely working with 3 different operating systems and their attendant idiosyncracies. File formats are a big part of that as each has its own executable and library formats, debug data formats and common compression formats. Having knowledge of the existence of these formats and tools to inspect these formats can go a long way towards tracking down things like linker and compiler misconfigurations.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>file</code> (POSIX) - Absolutely the first program you should reach for when you don’t know what kind of file something is. It will try to match bits of the file against all sorts of patterns and try to tell you what it is. For example, most “custom” files are just a zip file in disguise - Browser extensions, certain document formats, Windows appx’s and so on.</li>
<li><code>strings</code> (POSIX) - A lot of “binary” files (like executables) still contain human-readable strings. Often you only really care about those human readable strings and don’t care what kind of file it is. Trying to find a custom parser for the file is overkill. <code>strings</code> will print out all human-readable strings longer than a certain length that it finds. My most common use is to get certain information from crash dumps or to get file paths from DLLs, or to confirm that a C string literal correctly made it into the final executable (particularly when it came from a macro). Note that most text editors can also show you the file and let you search through it. You should reach for that first. <code>strings</code> is better for pipelines or batch processing.</li>
<li><code>ar</code> (POSIX) - Browse the object files inside a static library. Useful for tracking down <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64153">gnarly compiler bugs</a>.</li>
<li><code>nm</code> (POSIX) - Allows you to inspect static and dynamic libraries and see what symbols they define, which ones they export and which ones they rely on other libraries for. Useful for all those <code>Undefined symbol</code> errors or verifying that your linker visibility flags are working.</li>
<li><code>ldd</code> (Linux) / <code>otool -L</code> (macOS) - Find out which dynamic libraries or frameworks your library or executable depends on. They can help investigate issues like rpath failures. We commonly use them at Dropbox to verify that our final builds are correctly linked against the libraries we want.</li>
<li><code>dwarfdump</code> (POSIX) - Show debug information in libraries and executables, as well as dSYM bundles. Also useful for matching executables against their dSYMs by extracing <code>LC_UUID</code>s.</li>
<li><code>readelf</code> (Linux) / <code>otool -l</code> (macOS) / <code>dumpbin</code> (Windows) - Tells you all sorts of information about the executable formats (ELF, Mach-O and PE respectively) on each of these operating systems. This includes various headers that tell the OS how to load the program and which libraries it depends on. This can be used to verify that a build had ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) enabled for example, or to determine debug symbol UUIDs on Windows (similar to <code>dwarfdump</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://diffoscope.org/">diffoscope</a> (cross platform) - Like <code>diff</code>, but for all kinds of file comparison, not just text. It can tell you which object file in a static archive is different for example. I’ve used it extensively to <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2020/windows-deterministic-builds/">track down sources of non-reproducibility</a>. There is a <a href="https://try.diffoscope.org/">web version</a> for small files, or you can run it locally on Linux.</li>
<li><a href="https://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/">HexFiend</a> (macOS) - A fast and lightweight hex editor. A hex editor is a program that can display any binary file as a sequence of bytes. It has a useful compare mode for viewing diffs of binary files. I’ve mostly used it to interactively explore crash dumps when writing tools to process them. It has other nifty features like allowing you to select ranges of bytes and then interpret them as numbers. It also reminds me a lot of the old times when desktop apps were <em>fast</em> and <em>tiny</em> and a joy to use.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonwhite/ducible">pdbdump</a> (Windows) - A tool that ships with <a href="https://github.com/jasonwhite/ducible">ducible</a>. It can tell you a bunch of information about PDB files, including which absolute paths they refer to. Also used for <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2020/windows-deterministic-builds/">tracking down reproducibility issues</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GregTheDev/MinidumpExplorer">Minidump Explorer</a> (Windows) - Explore Windows/Crashpad crash dumps (minidump files) which are basically a set of nested structs in serialized form.</li>
</ol>



<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer">Process Explorer</a> (Windows) - A better Task Manager. For me, the most powerful ability is for it to show the process’ open files and handles. I used this to track down a very odd issue where we were seeing Bazel failing to delete certain files. I first used Process Monitor to determine which directory Bazel was trying to delete. I then used Process Explorer to determine which process was holding the file open. This turned out to be Python holding the <code>win32api</code> DLL open. This made no sense because the code was not directly importing any win32 libraries. I inserted pdb halts at various import boundaries, using Process Explorer to track which DLLs were loaded after each import. Using some semblance of binary search, I was able to track down that <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pkg_resources/blob/6f81a44010d1266494025647dd1e1f0befa5b26b/pkg_resources/_vendor/appdirs.py#L446"><code>pkg_resources</code></a> will import win32api to get some information if it is available in the path! A similar non-GUI tool on POSIX is <code>lsof</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon">Process Monitor</a> (Windows) - Really, one should just become familiar with all the SysInternals tools. This tool tracks all file and registry operations. Where Process Explorer shows a live view, Process Monitor collects a log, and allows you to filter the output by all sorts of selectors. It would have been <em>extremely difficult</em> to diagnose and reproduce <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12033">Bazel bug #12033</a> without it. I’ve written up how to <a href="https://github.com/nikhilm/demo-runfiles-dir">observe the bug</a>, including screenshots of using Process Monitor.</p></li>

<li><p><code>pmap</code> (Linux), <code>vmmap</code> (macOS), <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/vmmap">VMMap</a> (Windows) - Get a bird’s eye view of a process’ memory usage. Unlike tools like valgrind, which will only instrument heap allocated memory, this can give you the entire virtual memory usage, split by heap, stack, memory mapped files, libraries and so on. Of course, it only shows the current snapshot and won’t let you track the cause of leaks, but it can help identify their presence in a lightweight way, with no custom instrumentation or code changes. I’ve used this to understand application memory usage and identify the biggest areas for improvement. They can also help with things like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html#the-pymalloc-allocator"><code>pymalloc</code></a> which explicitly uses virtual memory directly for small object allocations and is thus invisible to heap allocation trackers.</p></li>

<li><p><code>sample</code> (macOS) - It can be run via Activity Manager or via the command line. It will observe a process for a few seconds and collect stack traces of every thread categorized by counts. This gives you a general sense of where the threads are spending time in that time period. Unfortunately its output is not very easy to read, but the flamegraph tools can render an image.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> + <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html">kcachegrind</a> (Linux) - Valgrind is a suite of tools and is possibly the most sophisticated open-source instrumentation framework for software …</p></li></ol></section></article></div></div>

But it may surprise consumers to learn what can actually happen to all those unwanted items.&nbsp;</p>  <p>A <em>Marketplace</em> investigation into Amazon Canada has found that perfectly good items are being liquidated by the truckload&nbsp;— and even destroyed or sent to landfill. Experts say hundreds of thousands of returns don't end up back on the e-commerce giant's website for resale, as customers might think. &nbsp;</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> journalists posing as potential new clients went undercover for a tour at a Toronto e-waste recycling and product destruction facility with hidden cameras. During that meeting, a representative revealed they get "tons and tons of Amazon returns," and that every week their facility breaks&nbsp;apart and shreds&nbsp;at least one tractor-trailer load of Amazon returns, sometimes even up to three to five truckloads. &nbsp;</p>  <p>"We're not the only ones. We couldn't handle all of Amazon. There's no way. It is so — it's like cockroaches, it multiplies. It's incredible," said the operations manager. &nbsp;</p>  <p>CBC News is concealing her identity because both this company and others that help Amazon dispose of or resell its online returns are afraid they'll lose their contracts if they speak publicly. &nbsp;</p>  <p>"Some of it will go into landfill," said the operations manager.

	<p><small>September 29, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Recently in the Fediverse, I read <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/104927850229553836">this toot</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Did you know that #Unix groups have passwords? Apparently if you set
one, you then have to use newgrp to log in to that group.</p>

<p>I have never seen anyone use unix group passwords.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Via <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye">@mhoye</a>.)</p>

<p>There are some things to say about this, but the first thing you
might wonder is why the <code>newgrp</code> command exists at all. The best
answer is that it's mostly a Unix historical relic (or, to put it
another way, a fossil).</p>

<p>In basically all current Unixes, processes can be in multiple groups
at once, often a lot of them. However this is a feature added in
BSD; it wasn't the case in the original Research Unixes, including
V7, and for a long time it wasn't the case in System V either. In
those Unixes, you could be listed as a member of various groups in
<code>/etc/groups</code>, but a given process was only in one group at a time.
The <code>newgrp</code> command was how you switched back and forth between
groups.</p>

<p>In general, <code>newgrp</code> worked in the way you'd expect, given Unix.  It was
a setuid root program that switched itself into the new group and then
<code>exec</code>'d into your shell (after carefully dropping its setuid powers).</p>

<p>(The actual behavior of <code>newgrp</code> in V7 is an interesting topic,
but that's for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/NewgrpV7Behavior">another entry</a>.)</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/">tuhs.org</a>, a
<code>newgrp</code> command appears in Research Unix V6, but it doesn't seem
to be in V5. You could have written one, though, as there was a
<code>setgid()</code> system call at least as far back as V4 (and V4 may be
where the idea of groups was invented). Somewhat to my surprise,
the existence of group passwords also dates back to V6 Unix.</p>

<p>(Before I started looking into this, I would have guessed that group
passwords were added somewhere in the System III/System V line of AT&amp;T
Unix, as AT&amp;T adopted it to 'production' usage.)</p>

<p>PS: I'm pleased to see that OpenBSD seems to have dropped the <code>newgrp</code>
command at some point. Linux and FreeBSD both continue to have it, and I
can't imagine that Illumos, Solaris, or any other surviving commercial
Unixes have gotten rid of it either.</p>

  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Making code run fast on GPUs requires a very different approach to making code run fast on CPUs because the hardware architecture is fundamentally different. If you come from a background of efficient coding on CPU then you’ll have to adjust some assumptions about what patterns are best.</p>
<p>Machine learning engineers of all kinds should care about squeezing performance from their models and hardware — not just for production purposes, but also for research and training. In research as in development, a fast iteration loop leads to faster improvement.</p>
<p>This article is a practical deep dive into making a specific deep learning model (<a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">Nvidia’s SSD300</a>) run fast on a powerful GPU server, but the general principles apply to all GPU programming. The SSD300 is an object-detection model trained on COCO, so output will be bounding boxes with probabilities for 81 classes of object.</p>

</h3>
<p>Part of the point of this article is to see what throughput we can get without leaving behind the flexibility of Python or the familiarity of the library the model was created with (Pytorch). We will not go super deep into custom CUDA kernels or use a standard “serving” framework because we will find many large optimizations available at a high level. We’ll start from a naively implemented simple video inference pipeline, following on from my introductory <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video_analytics_pytorch_pipeline/">Pytorch Video Pipeline</a> article.</p>

<p>The baseline version of the code will use the postprocessing functions in the <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">SSD300</a> repo as per the <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">PyTorch Hub page</a>. The implementers of this model do not pretend this sample code is production ready and we will find many ways to improve it. In fact, the published <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Detection/SSD#inference-performance-results">benchmarking results</a> for this model do not run the postprocessing code at all.</p>
<p>Top-level per-frame processing logic looks like this:</p>

<p>The important parts are highlighted above:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>buffer_to_image_tensor</code> converts Gstreamer buffers (decoded from video frames) into Pytorch tensors.</li>
<li><code>preprocess</code> turns the 0 to 255 integral RGB pixel values into scaled -1.0 to +1.0 float values.</li>
<li><code>detector(image_batch)</code> runs the SSD300 model, and it’s important to note that the model and input tensor are on a CUDA device (GPU) at this point.</li>
<li><code>postprocess</code> turns model output into bounding boxes and scores for each class label.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will dig into these functions later, for now let’s examine baseline performance.</p>
<h3 id="tracing-with-nvidia-nsight-systems">
  Tracing with Nvidia Nsight Systems
  <a href="#tracing-with-nvidia-nsight-systems">#</a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems">Nsight Systems</a> is a great tool to help with high-level GPU tuning. It shows CPU/GPU resource utilization, and is able to trace OS system calls, CUDA, CuDNN, CuBLAS, NVTX and even some technologies we don’t care about.</p>
<p>NVTX is an important API we’ll use for instrumenting regions and events in our code — this will be allow us to map traced utilization patterns to logic in the code.</p>
<p>Having run the baseline video pipeline with tracing enabled, opening Nsight Systems shows around 40 seconds of activity decoding and processing the video file (click for full resolution):</p>

<p>As you can see, there is plenty of information. Nsight Systems shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource utilization over time aggregated by hardware device (different CPUs and GPUs).</li>
<li>Resource utilization over time aggregated into processes and threads.</li>
<li>Call duration for numerous toolkits, including OS calls and the custom NVTX ranges I’ve put in our code. These will become clear as we zoom in.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve added annotations for some problems that are clear even at this very high level. CPU usage is high, GPU usage is low, and there are a lot of memory transfers between host (system memory) and device (GPU memory).</p>
<p>Let’s drill in to show processing for a couple of frames. Note the NTVX ranges in grey corresponding to logical parts of the code:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video_analytics_pipeline_tuning/images/tuning_baseline_two_frames.png">

        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Postprocessing taking &gt;90% of elapsed time is a disaster — from a high-level this is the first thing to fix, but what is causing it?</p>
<p>During postprocessing we can see that CPU usage is very high, GPU usage is very low (but not 0%), and there are constant memory transfers from device to host. The most likely scenario is that the postprocessing is largely being done on CPU, but it is constantly pulling small pieces of data from the GPU required for the processing.</p>
<p>Let’s drill in to show activity for a couple of milliseconds:</p>

        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Looking at the CUDA API timeline, we can see a lot of memory transfers and the green synchronization around them. The CUDA synchronization calls are further evidence that this postprocessing is being done partly on CPU and partly on GPU and is synchronized in a very fine-grained fashion. Let’s fix it.</p>
<p>Here is the baseline postprocessing code:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>At the point of the highlighted line, the arguments <code>locs</code> and <code>labels</code> are tensors on the GPU (these are returned directly from the SSD300 inference). The <code>decode_results</code> code is accessing the tensors elementwise and doing work on CPU, causing the repeated fine-grained requests for data to be sent from GPU to system memory.</p>
<p>The initial fix is super simple — we will send these entire tensors to system memory in a single operation.</p>

<p>Running the baseline code without tracing enabled gave us 9 FPS throughput and this improved code runs at just under 16 FPS. A 78% improvement is not bad for just typing <code>.cpu()</code> twice. This leads to a good rule of thumb for GPU programming:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Avoid Fine-Grained Synchronization</strong></p>
<p>Your host (CPU) code is dispatching work to an incredibly powerful co-processor which can do complex work asynchronously. However, host/device communication latency and synchronization are costly — try to dispatch large chunks of work and avoid fine-grained memory transfers.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The updated Nsight Systems view showing processing for two frames (below) has a clear difference. Instead of a constant stream of small transfers from device to host we now see one large transfer at the start of the postprocessing phase.</p>

<p>Postprocessing still takes over 80% of frame-processing time and the process is still heavily CPU bottlenecked. What if we could do the postprocessing using the GPU?</p>

<p>Turning preprocessing and postprocessing into heavily vectorized GPU code can be tricky for some models but is one of the highest-impact performance improvements you can make.</p>

<p><em>Cloud native storage tool has grown its contributor base by 260% since joining CNCF&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – October 7, 2020 – </strong><a href="https://www.cncf.io/">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of Rook. To move from the maturity level of <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">incubation to graduation</a> Rook has demonstrated growing adoption, an open governance process, feature maturity, and a strong commitment to community, sustainability, and inclusivity.</p>



<p>Rook is an open source cloud native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud native environments. Rook delivers its services via a Kubernetes Operator for each storage provider. It was originally accepted as a CNCF project in 2018. It is the thirteenth CNCF project, and the first project based on block, file, or object storage, to graduate.</p>



<p>“Storage is an important aspect of any cloud native deployment, and Rook fills a gap for teams who historically ran persistent storage outside of cloud native environments,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO/COO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Rook is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes through the operator paradigm, we are excited to see the project graduate and look forward to cultivating their growing community.”</p>



<p>Since joining CNCF, user adoptions, the community ecosystem, and project maturity have been steadily growing and improving. Rook is being used in production by several companies, including Calit2 UCSD, Finleap Connect, Geodata, and many <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">others</a>.</p>



<p>The maintainer team currently consists of <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/OWNERS.md">7 members</a>, with a healthy distribution of organizations including Cloudical, Nexenta, Red Hat, Suse, and Upbound. Since becoming an incubating project in September 2018, contributors to the core Rook repository have grown by 260% from 90 to 279. Over the last 12 months, 184 <a href="https://rook.devstats.cncf.io/d/22/prs-authors-table?orgId=1&amp;var-period_name=Last%20year&amp;var-repogroup_name=All">distinct contributors</a> have authored more than 1,140 pull requests.</p>



<p>“Rook was born from the need for automated storage management in cloud native environments. Rather than plugging external storage solutions into Kubernetes, we recognized that a storage platform was needed within a Kubernetes cluster,” said Travis Nielsen, Rook maintainer and senior principal software engineer at Red Hat. “We are very proud of this graduation that recognizes the maturity of the project and our dedication to quality, security, and reliability in production!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In 2018, when we donated Rook to CNCF, there was strong interest and community around Kubernetes and a need for automated storage management for the cloud native community. It was important to make sure that Rook remained free and community-driven to continue to drive innovation for the broader ecosystem,” said Jared Watts, co-founder of Rook and founding engineer at Upbound. “We’re proud of Rook’s thriving community, thanks to CNCF leadership and support, and look forward to pushing the ecosystem forward as a mature, production-ready cloud native storage solution.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOwrwYmBUpLUm6W5J5rhXvdVit818hWJ/view?usp=sharing">security audit</a> was performed by the CNCF Security SIG in December 2019, which resulted in 13 findings ranging from High to Low in severity, many of them common amongst open source projects. The Rook maintainers have taken steps to address these issues. The Security SIG reviewed the project and recommended to the TOC that the project should graduate with no substantive concerns regarding its architecture or health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We never lost a byte of data even though upgrading through the pre-GA releases and had an exceptional experience with the helpful Rook community,” said Christian Hüning, technical director at Finleap Connect. “It is running flawless and delivers us the performance and resilience we require for our most critical business applications.”</p>



<p>“These are air-gapped installs running critical software on Kubernetes,” said Marc Campbell, founder and CTO at Replicated. “We rely on Rook to manage Ceph so that we get highly-available, redistributable block and object store without having to build it ourselves.”</p>



<p>“We’re happy to see the maturity of the project as it has gone through the different phases within the CNCF ecosystem and its introduction of the various other backends that we could use in the future,” said Moh Ahmed, cloud infrastructure engineer at the Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks.</p>



<p>To officially graduate from incubating status, the project has achieved passing level criteria for <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1724">CII Best Practices</a> and adopted its own <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md">governance</a> structure.</p>

<h4>Part 1 - Complexity</h4>
<p>This world is a complex, interconnected web of systems. We've tried to make sense of this by creating various (seemingly-unrelated) disciplines. With the huge number of disciplines, I think you'll agree with me when I say that it's impossible for any one person to be an expert in all of these fields.</p>
<p>It's turtles all the way down, however, and even as you go deeper into a field, there's still so much complexity that you would despair at the idea of ever really understanding anything even within the confines of one specific field.</p>
<p>Most fields seem to exhibit a fractal pattern. By this, I mean that the more you try to <em>zoom in</em> onto a specific aspect of a system, the more detail is revealed. The same is true whether you're talking about economics or physics or biology. A whole new world of detail is revealed at all the different levels.</p>
<p>Of course, when confronted with complexity, our first instinct is to <em>reduce</em> and to treat these in isolation, and we've tried to come to terms with the complexity within fields by creating <strong>specializations</strong>, which are essentially sub-fields. </p>
<p>This is why a microbiologist seems to speak a completely different language from an ecologist. This might make you wonder whether the two fields are even related; one could argue that they both view the world through a radically different set of lenses.</p>
<p>As human knowledge progresses and we're able to understand systems at different levels, we're continuously spawning newer and newer specializations and hyperspecializations.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this concept clearer than in computer science where incredibly complex systems have been built to deliver cat videos to your screen. There's nothing special about my choice of computer science here, as I'm sure there are similar levels of complexity lurking beneath the surface of any domain.</p>
<p>You could spend years and years in deep study and you still wouldn't really fully <em>get</em> how a computer worked. There would always be gaps in your knowledge. Even behind something as seemingly simple as allowing you to read these words on your screen, there is so much hidden complexity. There are towers and towers of abstractions that enable this to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your CPU (essentially a tiny piece of silicon that can't do much but add two numbers together) executed a few million instructions during the time you were reading this sentence. Welcome to Computer Architecture!</li>
<li>These instructions are in most cases not understandable by a human. So we invented a <em>high-level language</em> and wrote another software to convert this high level language into the instructions. Welcome to Compilers!</li>
<li>There are multiple applications running on this system at the same time; somehow, a piece of code (the Operating System), managed to abstract all this away such that the applications are able to pretend that they're the only application running on the system. Similarly, there are other resources (RAM, files, I/O devices) that all need to be shared between the hundreds of programs running on your system. Welcome to Operating Systems!</li>
<li>Your device doesn't exist in isolation. In fact, a lot of its capabilities arise in relation with other devices. Just for the purpose of loading this website and viewing it, it had to send signals out into the ether which somehow (like a labelled envelope) found its way to the right servers and then they responded back with the data you were requesting. Welcome to Networks!</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, all of the cases above are huge simplifications. I haven't even begun scratching the surface. If you're curious to learn more, <a href="https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when">look at how much detail</a> is hidden behind a simple Google search.</p>
<p>So how do you even begin to understand and make sense of things which seem to have so many interconnected pieces?</p>
<p>A short digression here: there is a famous result in psychology about working memory (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">Miller's Law</a>). It suggests that humans can, on average, hold about 7 objects in their short-term memory at one time. Basically, if you're playing around with concepts in your head and thinking about how things relate with one another, there seems to be a cognitive limit of about 7 items.</p>
<p>Of course that is quite fuzzy and it is of course dangerous to generalize too much from any one result. However, I'd suggest that we can take away this lesson from Miller's Law: humans can't hold too many things in their head at the same time. Software systems are very complex beasts and it's beyond the scope of any person to hold in their head all the minute details of how something is working. </p>
<p>This is where <em>Abstraction</em> comes in. This is one of the fundamental building blocks of Computer Science, Engineering, and Problem Solving in general. Abstraction is when you squint your eyes and treat something as a <em>black box</em>. You are temporarily choosing to not care about what's happening inside the black box because other details are more important. </p>
<p>For an example of abstraction think about <em>interfaces</em> to objects you commonly use. A car for example hides a lot of complicated circuitry and machinery, but at the end of the day, all you need to care about is the steering wheel and a couple of pedals. That's the abstract view of a car. I don't care how that car turns these inputs into the multiple complicated outputs of fuel intake, torque etc. I completely ignore that because it's not important to me. I just want to get from point A to point B and I just need to know how to use the interface of the car to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>A well-designed interface (this is true of software interfaces too!) would allow you to focus on fewer aspects of the car and expend lesser <em>cognitive effort</em> when driving the car; I'm talking about manual vs automatic vs self-driving cars. </p>
<p>Sure, that's all well and good, but this article is about <em>Dealing with Complexity</em>, not about <em>Pretending it doesn't exist</em>. After all, someone does ultimately have to design and work with the underlying complexity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity">Tesler's Law</a>). You'd be a terrible automobile engineer if you were only able to see a car as its interface!</p>
<p>Things are even harder when you're a student and trying to learn more about a certain field you have no prior knowledge in; with so much to learn, how do you decide what is worth digging deeper into?</p>
<p>So hold on to this idea of abstraction, and let's talk about Fractal Learning, which is the focus of this blog post.</p>
<h4>Part 2 - Fractal Learning</h4>
<p>Fractal learning is essentially a strategy used to make sense of complex systems without getting too lost in the details. It's about being in that Goldilocks zone of not wasting your time learning too much (you have other things to do) while at the same time getting an overall understanding of how things fit together.</p>
<p>I first came across this concept in the excellent <a href="https://intermezzos.github.io/book/second-edition/fractal-learning.html">IntermezzOS Book</a>. It beautifully encapsulates the challenges of students and researchers working to make sense of complex systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's impossible to learn everything at once. If you keep digging, you'll find more questions, and digging into those questions leads to more questions... at some point, you have to say "okay, I know enough about this for now, it's time to move on."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's that picture of a tree again:</p>
<p><img alt="tree" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/tree.gif"></p>
<p>Let's imagine that this tree represents your field of interest. Your job is to somehow navigate this tree (or a branch) and learn <em>everything</em>. Now, clearly, learning everything isn't going to happen in this lifetime, but you still want to know enough to get a good idea of how everything fits together.</p>
<p>How do you do it?</p>
<p>Most people seem to follow one of two strategies - and these strategies come under the umbrella of <em>tree-traversal algorithms</em> in computer science. </p>
<p>Let's dig a bit deeper into both of these as they are relevant to the discussion.</p>
<p>The first is depth-first search (I call it <em>falling down the rabbit hole</em>). It's represented by this animation<sup id="sf-fractal-learning-1-back"><a href="#sf-fractal-learning-1" title="Source">1</a></sup>:</p>
<center><img alt="dfs" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/dfs.gif"></center>
<p>Here, you start at the root of the tree (represented by 1) and you keep going deeper and deeper along any one path. You stop when you can go no further and then try one of the other paths.</p>
<p>To better visualize it, here is the same algorithm working to solve a maze<sup id="sf-fractal-learning-2-back"><a href="#sf-fractal-learning-2" title="Source">2</a></sup>:</p>
<center><img alt="dfs" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/dfsmaze.gif"></center>
<p>I hope you get why I called it falling down the rabbit hole; you're just digging deeper and deeper into a specific topic without really taking a step back to explore other related topics. This is a laser-focused strategy that focuses on exclusion. It's the equivalent of the child who keeps asking "Why?" for a specific topic until she can no longer get a meaningful answer. If someone followed only this strategy for learning about things, she would have very detailed and specific knowledge about that one thing but have absolutely no idea about even closely related things.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the other strategy - breadth-first search (I call it <em>flooding</em>):</p>
<center><img alt="dfs" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/bfs.gif"></center>
<p>This is the polar opposite of the previous approach. Here you are quite timid, and you never go more than one level at a time, and you make your way level-by-level.</p>
<p>Here it is again, within the maze context<sup id="sf-fractal-learning-3-back"><a href="#sf-fractal-learning-3" title="Source">3</a></sup>:</p>
<center><img alt="dfs" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/bfsmaze.gif"></center>
<p>Again, I hope it makes sense why I called it flooding; it works similarly to how water slowly rises to flood an area. Here you dig very shallowly and take the time to understand the basics of everything before making your way deeper. This is focused on being inclusive and getting a sense of how everything fits together, even if it's not relevant. Someone who followed only this strategy would be a jack of all trades, he would know the fundamentals of everything; but like the figure of speech goes, he would be a master of none.</p>
<p>So which should you follow: breadth-first or depth-first?</p>
<p>Sadly, as with a lot of things in life, the answer is: it depends. You will have to use your judgment and intuition to decide which approach to use depending on the situation. Both approaches have their trade-offs.</p>
<p>Of course, given enough time, both approaches would cover the entire tree. As we saw, both approaches managed to solve the maze.</p>
<p>But we don't really have much time, do we?</p>
<p>In the following examples (both of which are …</p></div></div>

<p>Apple is requesting that Telegram shut down three channels used in Belarus to expose the identities of individuals belonging to the Belarusian authoritarian regime that may be oppressing civilians. Apple’s concern is that revealing the identities of law enforcement individuals may give rise to further violence.</p>
<p>Telegram, however, would prefer to keep the channels open, but the company said that it feels it has no choice in the matter. These channels are a tool for Belarus’ citizens protesting the recently rigged presidential election, but, with a centralized entity like Apple calling the shots on its own App Store, there’s little the protesters can do about it, explains Telegram CEO Pavel Durov.</p>

<p>“I think this situation is not black and white and would rather leave the channels be, but typically Apple doesn’t offer much choice for apps like Telegram in such situations,” Durov wrote in his Telegram channel.</p>
<p>The tension between Apple and Telegram is part of the wider issue surrounding Belarus’ 2020 election, which saw incumbent Alexander Lukashenko re-elected despite claims and evidence the election was rigged. The result has seen thousands of Belarusian citizens take to the streets to protest.</p>
<p>This tension also highlights a problem with centralized app stores. “Unfortunately, I assume these channels will end up getting blocked on iOS, but remain available on other platforms,” Durov added.</p>

<p>For two decades now, I have been interested in sleep research due to my professional involvement in memory and learning. This e-book attempts to produce a synthesis of what is known about sleep with a view to practical applications, esp. in people who need top-quality sleep for their learning or creative achievements. Neurophysiology of sleep is an explosively growing branch of science. Many theories that are currently contested will soon be forgotten as a result of new findings. Consequently, this text is likely to grow old very quickly (compare old versions from <a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep2000.htm">2000</a> and <a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm">2012</a>). Still, some basic truths about sleep are well-established, and practical conclusions can be drawn with the benefit to human creativity and intellectual accomplishment. In this text, I provide some links to research papers and popular-scientific articles that advocate disparate and contradictory theories. Please consult other sources to be certain you do not to get a one-sided view! This text includes some indications on how to use <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">free running sleep</a> in the treatment of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia</a>, advanced and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">delayed sleep phase syndromes</a>, and some other sleep disorders.

<h2><span id="Dreams_of_good_sleep">Dreams of good sleep</span></h2>
<p>It is everyone's dream to wake up fresh, happy, and ready for action on a daily basis. Sadly, in the modern world, only a small minority lives that dream. Yet the dream is within reach for most healthy people given:
</p>
<ol><li> a bit of knowledge, and</li>
<li> a readiness to make some lifestyle sacrifice.</li></ol>
<p>I hope that this article compiles all the basic ingredients of knowledge that are helpful in accomplishing refreshing sleep. As for the sacrifice, it is important to begin with the understanding that one cannot eat one's cake and have it too. Healthy sleep may be incompatible with some modern habits, some cravings, or some lifestyle choices. At worst, refreshing sleep may be incompatible with one's job or even long-term goals. Due to the latter fact, this article cannot provide a solution for everyone. Moreover, having a happy and fresh mind on a daily basis is a difficult thing to accomplish even with the whole arsenal of scientific knowledge and a full focus on good sleep. However, let me state it emphatically:

<p><b>Good sleep on most nights is feasible for most people!</b></p>
<p>This article was originally written <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleep2000.htm">a decade ago</a>. I have always been interested in memory, learning, and sleep. In addition, in my job, sleep is as important as oxygen. As we all move deeper into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">Information Age</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy">Knowledge Economy</a>, the issues discussed herein will become more and more important for each of us. After writing the original article, I had the great pleasure of getting in touch with hundreds of people experiencing various sleep problems. I came to see first hand how knowledge of sleep helps solve their problems. I could also see how the industrialized age lays obstacles in one's quest for good sleep and high productivity. I have witnessed a true epidemic of sleep phase disorders, an explosion of interest in polyphasic sleep, and an exponential increase in interest in the matters of sleep in general. Despite my pleas, many people just cannot avoid using an alarm clock, running all-nighters before exams, waking their kids cranky for school, popping pills before sleep, leaving babies in their cots to <dfn id=""><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#cry_it_out_method" title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary"><span title="See entry at: Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary § cry it out method">cry it out</span></a></dfn> for sleep, etc. The picture would be pretty sad and alarming were it not for the fact that there is hope in knowledge. With a degree of determination, everyone can improve his, her, or their kids' sleep.
</p><p>This article is a compilation of the most important and the most interesting things about the biology of sleep. It is supposed to help you gain knowledge needed to achieve high quality refreshing sleep that will boost your mental powers. The article explains why sleep is vitally important for health and for the brain. It argues that sleep deserves highest respect, and that most people could get excellent sleep if they only followed the prescribed rules.
</p><p>Since writing the original <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleep2000.htm">Good sleep, good learning, good life</a>, tremendous progress has been made in the science of sleep. My own work with tools such as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> has shed some interesting light on the connection between sleep and learning. As I kept addressing the progress in sleep science in minor articles and FAQs, some visitors to <a href="http://super-memory.com/">super-memory.com</a> complained that valuable nuggets of information are dispersed throughout the site instead of being organized in a more encyclopedic manner in a single article. Here then comes a comprehensive compilation, in which I would like to retain the focus on practical knowledge that is helpful in achieving good sleep. However, I would still like to smuggle in some lesser known research findings that might be inspiring for an average reader and/or a scientist working in the fields of sleep, memory, and learning. If you believe I left out anything important that others should know, please <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">let me know</a>.

And if even that is too long, here are the highlights:

<li> let babies and young children sleep on demand, co-sleeping is a great idea (even if many pediatricians will tell you otherwise)</li>
<li> exercise, learning, and sleep are your best tools for brain growth!</li>
<li> avoid regulating sleep and alertness with substances, esp. sleeping pills, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Effects_of_alcohol_on_sleep" title="Effects of alcohol on sleep">alcohol</a>, illegal drugs, nicotine, and <dfn id=""><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#caffeine" title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary"><span title="See entry at: Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary § caffeine">caffeine</span></a></dfn></li></ul>
<h2><span id="Understanding_sleep">Understanding sleep</span></h2>
<p>Too few people realize how important sleep is! The alarm clock is an often-used fixture in an overwhelming majority of households of the modern world. By using electric lighting, alarm clocks, sleeping pills, and shift-work, we have wreaked havoc on the process of sleep.

<p>Over the last hundred years of the twentieth century, we have intruded upon a delicate and finely regulated process that was perfected by several hundred million years of evolution. Yet only recently have we truly become aware that this intrusion may belong to the most important preventable factors that are slowing societal growth in industrial nations! In a couple of years from now, we may look at alarm clocks and "sleep regulation" in the same way that we look today at other "great" human inventions in the league of cigarettes, asbestos materials, or radioactive cosmetics.
</p><p>Check this list below and see which applies to you:
</p>
<ul><li> I often have problems with falling asleep at the right time</li>
<li> I often find it painful to get up in the morning due to sleepiness</li>
<li> I am often awfully drowsy at school or at work</li>
<li> I regularly cut my sleep by 2-3 hours as compared with what my body seems to need</li>
<li> I use the alarm clock and truly hate it</li>
<li> I drink buckets of coffee or coke</li>
<li> I often take 2-4 hour naps in the evening</li>
<li> for me, at least one of the above is a source of regular stress or reduced productivity</li></ul>
<p>I bet that chances are around 90% you could subscribe to one of the above. Perhaps this is why you are reading this article. It is also highly likely you have already learned to accept the status quo, and you do not believe you can do much about it. This article may hint at some remedies. However, the bad news is that for a real solution you will probably need to change your family life, your work, your boss, or some social rules!
</p><p><b>Sleep isn't just a form of rest!</b> Sleep plays a critical physiological function, and is indispensable for your intellectual development! Those who do not respect their sleep are not likely to live to their full mental potential!
</p><p>Modern society has developed a set of well-entrenched rules that keep sleep in utmost disregard. This has been driven to pathological levels in American society. Here are some bad rules that hurt sleep:
</p>
<ul><li> it is ok to use an alarm clock to cut sleep short</li>
<li> it is ok to work in shifts</li>
<li> it is ok to travel people around the world without much attention to the jet lag problem</li>
<li> it is ok to save time by sleeping less and working more</li>
<li> it is ok to pull kids out of bed in time for school</li>
<li> it is ok to skip nights before important exams, etc.</li></ul>
<p>Cutting down on sleep does not make people die (<a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!" title="If you do not sleep, you die!">at least not immediately</a>). It does make them feel miserable, but the ease with which we recover by getting just one good night of sleep seems to make sleep look cheap. Even the reports from the Guinness World Record attempt at sleeplessness (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Gardner_(record_holder)">Randy Gardner's</a> awakathon in 1964 lasted 11 days) trivialized the effects of sleeplessness. Many books on psychiatry and psychology still state that there aren't any significant side effects to prolonged sleeplessness! This is false! The Guinness Book of Records has since withdrawn its <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> category due to the involved health risks.
</p><p>In 1992, when Bill Clinton was running for president, he proudly admitted that he went 48 hours without sleep because he really wanted to become the next president. Former Senator Bob Dole "improved" the record in 1996 presidential campaign: <i>We have been going 78 hours. We've got to go 96. We have been going around the clock for America.</i> Dole's feat was matched by Vice President Albert Gore Jr., who kept campaigning for three days before the election day of November 7, 2000. After the election, Gore still kept on his feet by going into extra hours of the concede-retract cycle of his cliffhanger contest against Governor George W. Bush of Texas. When Barack Obama was asked about his most …</p></div></div>

                        <p><span>If you drive the&nbsp;long stretch of Interstate 5 known as the Westside Freeway, from the foot of&nbsp;the Grapevine through Buttonwillow and on to Los Banos, you’ll be cruising along the edge of the richest and most productive farm land in the world. If, halfway through that journey, you stop at a place called Kettleman City (a name more ambitious than accurate) and stand at the edge of the parking lot behind the In-and-Out Burger looking due east down a gentle slope, you’ll be staring at what was once the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Of course, from your perch at the In-and-Out, you won’t see any water. Tulare Lake is long gone, all 700 square miles of it; its water restrained behind dams in the foothills and channelled away into the irrigation canals that make the Central Valley so productive. In its place are hundreds of square miles of cotton and corn, and an elaborate system of drains, ditches, channels and sumps designed to keep the lake bed farmable.</p>
<p><span>The massive rearranging of California’s water resources, which began with the Gold Rush and continues to the present day, is a triumph of ingenuity and engineering, and the utter destruction of the original, pre-1849 biome.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Before to the discovery of gold, the Central Valley was far wetter than it is today. In a sense, the valley respirated water, breathing in during the wet seasons and breathing out during the dry. In winter when the rains came and in spring when the snow melted, water poured into the valley, swelling the rivers and filling the low places with seasonal lakes, bogs, potholes and vernal pools. When the rains stopped in late spring, and the weather turned hot, the remaining water evaporated and the grasses dried up. </span></p>

<p><span>The hydraulic system of the Central Valley has three main zones: the Sacramento Valley, the northern San Joaquin Valley and the southern San Joaquin Valley, also&nbsp;called the Tulare Basin. Water from the two northernmost zones flow into San Francisco Bay via the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers which meet east of the bay in the Delta, the largest estuary in the western United States.&nbsp;</span><span>The third zone, the southern San Joaquin Valley, is usually&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Endorheic_basin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorheic</a>. </span></p>
<p>Before the replumbing of the rivers, in most years water did not leave the Tulare Basin. In wet years, however, Tulare Lake overflowed into the San Joaquin River, sending water up through the Delta and out the Golden Gate. There were two other lakes at the far southern end of the valley, Kern Lake and Buena Vista Lake, both now drained away by canals and dams. During the wettest years these lakes would also overflow, linking up with each other and Tulare Lake to form a single, vast body of water. The missing lakes and the tens of thousands of acres of tule swamp and grassland that ringed them thus waxed and waned with the seasons, part of a complex ecology that supported enough fish, fowl and fauna to make it one of the richest biomes in the world.</p>
<p><span>The arrival of the Spanish settlers to California in the 18</span><span><sup>th</sup></span><span> century did little to upset the natural arrangement of the Central Valley. Beyond stock grazing, the <em>californios</em> had little interest in the interior of the state; it was too far from the coast and too hot in the summer for their tastes. Better to stay in Monterey and Santa Barbara and let the <em>indios</em> have the Central Valley.</span></p>

<p><span>For their part, the natives of the Central Valley were content to hunt and gather rather than cultivate.&nbsp;</span>Acorns from the oaks that lined the creeks and rivers were gathered in baskets and stored in holes until needed. Birds and wild game were hunted with throwing sticks and bows and arrows, or trapped in snares.&nbsp;<span>A simple wicker fish weir in a creek yielded hundreds of pounds of salmon during the spring and winter runs. This bounty, when dried, could feed the tribe for months.&nbsp;</span><span>(In the wet years, the salmon even made it from the San Joaquin River into Tulare Lake, to the great joy of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.calwater.ca.gov/Admin_Record/C-076127.pdf">Yokut</a><span> who lived in the tule reeds along its banks.) </span></p>
<p><span>As one wag has said, if the pilgrims had landed in California instead of Plymouth Rock, the rest of the country would never have been settled. Indeed, the Anglos who began to enter the state in the early decades of the 19</span><span><sup>th</sup></span><span> century —&nbsp;</span><span>Yankee merchants, run away sailors and fur trappers —&nbsp;</span><span>were dismissive of both the californios and the indians, and for the same reason, because they were insufficiently industrious, content to herd cattle or fish salmon rather than develop the land to its “full potential”. </span></p>
<p><span>The modern settlement of the Central Valley began&nbsp;when Americans started to arrive overland via the Oregon Trail in the 1840s. Many of these newcomers became Mexican citizens, took Mexican wives, and received Mexican land grants along the Sacramento, Feather and American Rivers, grants that&nbsp;were measured in Spanish leagues (4,428 acres), of which five leagues would be considered the usual size. By 1846, when the last of the Mexican land grants were made, much of the Valley had been parceled out. </span></p>
<p><span>As for the people who were already there,<span>&nbsp;</span>perhaps half of the Central Valley indians died in 1833, a year after mountain man Ewing Young&nbsp;led a group of trappers through the valley, inadvertently spreading malaria as they went.

<p><span>Most&nbsp;accounts of the environmental damage caused by the Gold Rush focus on the easily explained, direct effects of mining.

<p>Recently, while Harrison Hayford was browsing in one of his regular bookstores, he overheard an argument about Melville. It was a longstanding debate at the store: wasn't American literature just a contradiction in terms, like "military intelligence" or "business ethics"? Well, what about Melville? The young man at the table shook his head. Melville may have been a genius, he said, but his books were endless, incomprehensible -- what he really needed was an editor. Then Hayford made his contribution! "He's got one," he said.
</p>
<!--<div style="border:solid 1px darkslateblue; float: right; width: 454px; padding: 10px; margin: 15px;">

</div>
-->
<p>So he has: Hayford is the general editor of <i>The Writings of Herman Melville</i>, being published jointly by Northwestern University and the Newberry Library. Unfortunately for the young man in the store, and for everybody who had <i>Moby-Dick</i> crammed into their brains at school, the series isn't reducing Melville to bitesize bits. Hayford and his associates are working to recover and preserve every twitch and quirk of Melville's style, in all its unabridged madness -- everything except his lousy spelling.</p>
<p>When work on the series began in 1965, Hayford thought it would take four years to finish. He now thinks that was hopelessly naive, even if everything had gone well. As it is, there have been endless delays in the textual work -- which is the purpose of this edition -- and, inevitably, problems with money. After 17 years, the series has yet to reach the hallway point. Only 6 volumes of the projected 15 have been published; nothing at all has come out since 1971. But publication resumes this June, with Israel Potter: His 50 Years of Exile. Melville's short stories, <i>The Piazza Tales</i>, will follow later this summer. Hayford now hopes to have the whole series ready by the time he retires from Northwestern, three years from now.</p>
<p>Granted, these are not the books the whole world has been waiting for. From the beginning, the project has faced the hostility of the literary Establishment and the indifference of the public.</p>
<p>The hostility, as we shall see, is more complicated than it first appears, but the indifference is easy to understand. If you look through the long "textual note" that ends each volume, you soon become convinced that the editors are a bunch of pedantic crazies. There are long lists of "substantive variants" and "accidentals" and a "report on end-line hyphenation." Even the most fanatical admirer of Melville will find his eyes glazing over. Who needs this shit? What does it have to do with the books? It's an old argument. The editing method Hayford uses is still a new, and controversial, procedure, but editors generally have been the butt of jokes for centuries. What hurts is that the writers are the ones making the jokes. From Rabelais on, writers have had endless fun with scholarly foot notes and emendations, the eternal quibbling of the ivory tower. Alexander Pope wrote a nasty mock-epic about an inoffensive editor of Shakespeare named Louis Theobald. Nabokov's <i>Pale Fire</i> is about a crazed scholar making up surreal interpretations of an entirely sensible poem. William Butler Yeats wrote how</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Old, learned, respectable bald heads<br>
Edit and annotate the lines<br>
That young men, tossing on their beds<br>
Rhymed out in love's despair....<br>
All shuffle there, all cough in ink<br>
All wear the carpet with their shoes;<br>
All think what other people think<br>
Lord, what would they say<br>
Did their Catullus walk that way?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hayford, I must report, is getting bald, and he is in his early 60s -- if that counts as old -- but otherwise Yeats wouldn't recognize him. I have never seen him shuffle: his normal walking pace is hard to keep up with. Nor is he much interested in what other people think. A friend once spotted him in a used bookstore with a huge stack of books on sex -- everything from medical texts to The Sensuous Man. "Everybody tells me that Melville was homosexual," he said. "I've decided to figure it out for myself.</p>
<p>But Melville was one of the writers who made fun of editors, and I thought Hayford might at times be embarrassed by that. But if he is, he hides it very well. The Newberry has a copy of the Shakespeare set that Melville owned, and Hayford has painfully copied out Melville's marginal scribbles and underlinings from the original in the Harvard library. Beside one of the editor's fussy explanations of what Shakespeare meant, Melville had written "Peace, thou ass of a commentator!" Hayford's laugh when he saw it again was loud and delighted.</p>

<a href="http://www.leesandlin.com/images/photo_melvillep18.jpg"><img src="http://www.leesandlin.com/images/photo_melvillep18-small.jpg" width="350" title="Photo by Kathy Richland, courtesy of the Newberry Library. Click to enlarge."></a>
<p>Hayford has gotten revenge anyway -- because Melville posed as a scholar on whales. He knew about whaling firsthand, but he backed it up with those long chapters on what all the ancient authorities said. "I have turned over whole libraries to make my book," he boasted. Hayford found that Melville had gotten most of it from the encyclopedia -- under "Whales."</p>
<p>Melville really didn't have the patience to be a scholar. He barely had the patience to be a writer. He wrote his books feverishly, whether for money or out of creative frenzy, and he couldn't much be bothered with them once he was finished. In <i>Pierre</i>, he talked about how much he hated correcting proofs: "They were replete with errors; but preoccupied with the thronging and undiluted, pure imaginings of things, he became impatient of such minute, gnat-like torments; he randomly corrected the worst of them and let the rest go, jeering with himself at the rich harvest thus furnished to the entomological critics." But the entomological critics, that is, the nit-picking, classifying critics, ignored the harvest. Even while he was writing the book, his career was slipping away from him.</p>
<p>The story has been told so often that it's become a symbol for what happens to a writer in America. Melville began writing when he was 25, largely because he couldn't think of anything else to do. All he knew about was sailing. But he'd hated that, so he wrote a romantic story, slightly true, about how he'd ditched ship in the South Seas. The book, Typee, was published in 1846, and became an instant best-seller. People loved exotic true adventures, so he wrote another, <i>Omoo</i> which was almost as big a hit. But he was already getting bored. The next book, <i>Mardi</i>, starts out as another romance and midway through changes into a lunatic voyage around the world -- which proves to be an endless chain of Polynesian islands. It bombed. He wrote two more sailing stories in a hurry, <i>White-Jacket</i> and <i>Redburn</i>, but he was hooked: he told his father-in-law "It is my sincerest wish to write books that 'fail' He meant it: the next book was <i>Moby-Dick</i>.</p>
<p>In 1851, while he was finishing <i>Moby-Dick</i> he wrote to his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, "Until I was twenty-five, I had no development at all. From my twenty-fifth year I date my life. Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded within myself." He compared himself to a seed found in the Pyramids, "which, after being three thousand years a seed and nothing but a seed, being planted in English soil, it developed itself, grew to greenness, and fell to mould. So I ... But I feel that I am now come to the inmost bud of the flower, and that the flower must shortly fall to the mould."</p>
<p>This was, in a way, what happened. <i>Moby-Dick</i> wasn't a complete disaster -- it did get some respectful reviews -- but Melville was running short of money. He decided to do an ordinary, conventional novel. But he'd just spent two years exploring the cosmos with Ahab and lshmael. He was the last man qualified to do something ordinary. The book he wrote, <i>Pierre</i>, is still one of the strangest novels ever written. The first half is a nightmarish parody of sentimental fiction. Love, he informs us, is "a volume bound in rose-leaves, clasped with violets, and by the beaks of hummingbirds printed with peach-juice on the leaves of lilies." After 200 pages of this, Melville runs completely amok, throws the plot away, and goes off on a string of berserk improvisations on such subjects as kinky sex and literary fame. In the end everybody dies. So did the book.</p>
<p>In a desperate attempt to keep going, he started writing stories for magazines. Israel Potter, the short novel the Northwestern-Newberry series is publishing this June, was written during these years. "He did it with a gun to his head," Hayford says. "He promised the publisher there'd be no -- metaphysics. But he still managed to get in a few licks of his own."</p>
<p>It was too late. Hayford says concisely, "He was through." The short stories, <i>The Piazza Tales</i>, were published in 1856. There was one more novel, the most sublime of black comedies, <i>The Confidence Man</i>y the next year. Then, nothing. He was 37.</p>
<p>It was an amazing run, ten books in 12 years, including some of the best prose ever published in America. But he couldn't live on what he wrote. At the end he had no audience, no publisher, and no money.</p>
<p>Israel Potter is in a way Melville's parody of his own career. It is based on a true story. Potter was a young American innocent caught up in the Revolutionary War who had a string of incredible -- and, in Melville's version, hilarious -- adventures, hobnobbing with Benjamin Franklin and John Paul Jones; but when peacetime came he was left a penniless exile in another country. So Melville was swept along on the rising tide of his genius, but when his luck ran out he was stranded. "I'm sure that's what attracted him to the story,*' Hayford says. "Then you have the names, Israel and Ishmael from <i>Moby-Dick</i>. Someone even pointed out -- though I don't think this decided him -- that Melville and the real Israel Potter have the same birthday, August first."</p>
<p>Potter's last years were spent in wretched poverty, but Melville, it turned out, did not do as badly as all that. He eventually got a job as a customs inspector in New York, and kept it for 20 years. He didn't stop writing altogether. He took up poetry, and occasionally had volumes of it privately printed. They received scattered reviews, and sank without a trace. But he returned to …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I plan to write a series of articles to discuss some simple but not embarrassingly parallel algorithms. These will have practical usages and would most likely be on many-core CPUs or CUDA GPUs. Today’s is the first one to discuss a parallel algorithm implementation for CSV file parser.</em></p>

<p>In the old days, when our spin disk speed maxed out at 100MiB/s, we only have two choices: either we don’t care about the file loading time at all, treating it as a cost of life, or we have a file format entangled with the underlying memory representation to squeeze out the last bits of performance for data loading.</p>

<p>That world has long gone. My current workstation uses a software RAID0 (mdadm) over two 1TB Samsung 970 EVO NVMe storage for data storage. This setup usually gives me around 2GiB/s read / write speed (you can read more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3JYEIsjH8">about my workstation here</a>).</p>

<p>The CSV file format is firmly in the former category of the two. The thing that people who exchange CSV files care most, above anything else, is the interoperability. Serious people who actually care about speed and efficiency moved to other formats such as <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Apache Parquet</a> or <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a>. But CSV files live on. It is still by far the most common format in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/docs/datasets">Kaggle</a> contests.</p>

<p>There exist many implementations for CSV file parsers. Among them, <a href="https://github.com/p-ranav/csv2">csv2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser">Vince’s CSV Parser</a> would be two common implementations. That doesn’t account for standard implementations such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">the one from Python</a>.</p>

<p>Most of these implementations shy away from utilizing many-cores. It is a reasonable choice. In many likely scenarios, you would load many small-ish CSV files, and these can be done in parallel at task-level. That is an OK choice until recently, when I have to deal with some many GiBs CSV files. These files can take many seconds to load, even from tmpfs. That indicates a performance bottleneck at CPU parsing time.</p>

<p>The most obvious way to overcome the CPU parsing bottleneck is to fully utilize the 32 cores of Threadripper 3970x. This can be embarrassingly simple if we can reliably breakdown the parsing by rows. Unfortunately, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.html">RFC 4180</a> prevents us from simply using line breaks as row delimiters. Particularly, when quoted, a cell content can contain line breaks and these will not be recognized as row delimiters.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wiseio/paratext">Paratext</a> first implemented a two-pass approach for parallel CSV parsing. Later it is documented in <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/chunker-sigmod19.pdf">Speculative Distributed CSV Data Parsing for Big Data Analytics</a></em>. The paper discussed, besides the two-pass approach, a more sophisticated speculative approach that is suitable for the higher-latency distributed environment.</p>

<p>In the past few days, I implemented a variant of the two-pass approach that can max out the NVMe storage bandwidth. It is an interesting journey as I didn’t write any serious parser in C for a very long time.</p>

<h3 id="the-csv-file-parsing-problem">The CSV File Parsing Problem</h3>

<p>CSV file represents simple tabular data with rows and columns. Thus, to parse a CSV file, it is meant to divide a text file into cells that can be uniquely identified with row and column index.</p>

<p>In C++, this can be done in zero-copy fashion with <code>string_view</code>. In C, every string has to be null-terminated. Thus, you need to either manipulate the original buffer, or copy it over. I elected the latter.</p>

<h3 id="memory-mapped-file">Memory-Mapped File</h3>

<p>To simplify the parser implementation, it is assumed we are given a block of memory that is the content of the CSV file. This can be done in C with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3

6

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="openmp">OpenMP</h3>

<p>We are going to use <a href="https://openmp.llvm.org/">OpenMP</a>’s parallel for-loop to implement the core algorithm. Nowadays, Clang has pretty comprehensive support for OpenMP. But nevertheless, we will only use the very trivial part of what OpenMP provides.</p>

<h3 id="find-the-right-line-breaks">Find the Right Line Breaks</h3>

<p>To parallel parse a CSV file, we first need to break it down into chunks. We can divide the file into 1MiB sequence of bytes as our chunks. Within each chunk, we can start to find the right line breaks.</p>

<p>The double-quote in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.html">RFC 4180</a> can quote a line break, that makes us find the right line breaks harder. But at the same time, the RFC defines the way to <em>escape</em> double-quote by using two double-quote back-to-back. With this, if we count double-quotes from the beginning of a file, we know that a line break is within a quoted cell if we encounter an odd number of double-quotes so far. If we encounter an even number of double-quotes before a line break, we know that is a beginning of a new row.</p>

<p>We can count double-quotes from the beginning of each chunk. However, because we don’t know if there are an odd or even number of double-quotes before this chunk, we cannot differentiate whether a line break is the starting point of a new row, or just within a quoted cell. What we do know, though, is that a line break after an odd number of double-quotes within a chunk is the same class of line breaks. We simply don’t know at that point which class that is. We can count these two classes separately.</p>

<p>This is our first pass.</p>

<h3 id="columns-and-rows">Columns and Rows</h3>

<p>After the first pass, we can sequentially go through each chunk’s statistics to calculate how many rows and columns in the given CSV file.</p>

<p>The line breaks in the first chunk after even number of double-quotes would be the number of rows in the first chunk. Because we know the number of double-quotes in the first chunk, we now know what class of line breaks in the second chunk are the start points of a row. The sum of these line breaks would be the number of rows.</p>

<p>For the number of columns, we can go through the first row and count the number of column delimiters outside of double-quotes.</p>

<h3 id="wiring-the-cell-strings">Wiring the Cell Strings</h3>

<p>The second pass will copy the chunks over, null-terminate each cell, escape the double-quotes if possible. We can piggyback our logic on top of the chunks allocated for the first pass. However, unlike the first pass, the parsing logic doesn’t start at the very beginning of each chunk. It starts at the first starting point of a row in that chunk and ends at the first starting point of a row in the next chunk.</p>

<p>The second pass turns out to occupy the most of our parsing time, simply because it does most of the string manipulations and copying in this pass.</p>

<h3 id="more-optimizations">More Optimizations</h3>

<p>Both the first pass and second pass unrolled into 8-byte batch parsing, rather than per-byte parsing. For the second pass, we did some bit-twiddling to quickly check whether there are delimiters, double-quotes, or line breaks that needed to be processed, or we can simply copy it over.</p>

<p>You can find more discussions about <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2017/01/20/how-quickly-can-you-remove-spaces-from-a-string/">this kind of bit-twiddling logic here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-fast">Is it Fast?</h3>

<p>The complete implementation is available at <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/lib/nnc/ccv_cnnp_dataframe_csv.c">ccv_cnnp_dataframe_csv.c</a>.</p>

<p>The implementation was compared against <a href="https://github.com/p-ranav/csv2">csv2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser">Vince’s CSV Parser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wiseio/paratext">Paratext</a>.</p>

<p>The workstation uses AMD Threadripper 3970x, with 128GiB memory running at 2666MHz. It has 2 Samsung 1TB 970 EVO with mdadm-based RAID0.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/p-ranav/csv2">csv2</a>, I compiled <code>csv2/benchmark/main.cpp</code> with:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>g++ <span>-I</span>../include <span>-O3</span> <span>-std</span><span>=</span>c++11 <span>-o</span> main main.cpp
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser">Vince’s CSV Parser</a>, I compiled <code>csv-parser/programs/csv_bench.cpp</code> with:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>g++ <span>-I</span>../single_include <span>-O3</span> <span>-std</span><span>=</span>c++17 <span>-o</span> csv_bench csv_bench.cpp <span>-lpthread</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wiseio/paratext">Paratext</a> hasn’t been actively developed for the past 2 years. I built it after patched <code>paratext/python/paratext/core.py</code> by removing the <code>splitunc</code> method. The simple benchmark Python script look like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>import</span> <span>paratext</span>
<span>import</span> <span>sys</span>

<span>dict_frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>paratext</span><span>.</span><span>load_raw_csv</span><span>(</span><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>allow_quoted_newlines</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I choose the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/seaa0612/scaled-data">DOHUI NOH dataset</a>, which contains a 16GiB CSV file with 496,782 rows and 3213 columns.</p>

<p>First, to test the raw performance, I moved the downloaded file to <code>/tmp</code>, which is mounted as in-memory tmpfs.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Software</th>
      <th>Time</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Paratext</td>
      <td>12.437s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vince’s CSV Parser</td>
      <td>37.829s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>csv2</td>
      <td>19.221s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NNC’s Dataframe CSV</td>
      <td>4.093s</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The above performance accounts for the best you can get if file IO is not a concern. With the said 970 EVO RAID0, we can run another round of benchmark against the real disk IO. Note that for this round of benchmark, we need to drop system file cache with: <code>sudo bash -c "echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"</code> before each …</p></div></div>

<b></b><p><b>Abstract</b>. Lamport showed that a replicated deterministic state machine is a general way to implement a highly available system, given a consensus algorithm that the replicas can use to agree on each input. His Paxos algorithm is the most fault-tolerant way to get consensus without real-time guarantees. Because general consensus is expensive, practical systems reserve it for emergencies and use leases (locks that time out) for most of the computing. This paper explains the general scheme for efficient highly available computing, gives a general method for understanding concurrent and fault-tolerant programs, and derives the Paxos algorithm as an example of the method.</p>
<b><span size="4"><p>1. Introduction</p>
</span></b><p>A system is available if it provides service promptly on demand. The only way to make a highly available system out of less available components is to use redundancy, so the system can work even when some of its parts are broken. The simplest kind of redundancy is replication: make several copies or ‘replicas’ of each part.</p>
<p>This paper explains how to build efficient highly available systems out of replicas, and it gives a careful specification and an informal correctness proof for the key algorithm. Nearly all of the ideas are due to Leslie Lamport: replicated state machines [5], the Paxos consensus algorithm [7], and the methods of specifying and analyzing concurrent systems [6]. I wrote the paper because after I had read Lamport’s papers, it still took me a long time to understand these methods and how to use them effectively. Surprisingly few people seem to know about them in spite of their elegance and power. </p>
<p>In the next section we explain how to build a replicated state machine that is both efficient and highly available, given a fault-tolerant algorithm for consensus. Section 3 gives some background on the consensus problem and its applications. Section 4 reviews the method we use for writing specifications and uses it to give a precise specification for consensus in several forms. In section 5 we introduce the basic idea behind the Paxos algorithm for consensus and derive the algorithm from this idea and the specification. Finally we explain some important optimizations and summarize our conclusions. </p>
<b><span size="4"><p>2. Replicated State Machines</p>
</span></b><p>Redundancy is not enough; to be useful it must be coordinated. The simplest way to do this is to make each non-faulty replica do the same thing. Then any non-faulty replica can provide the outputs; if the replicas are not fail-stop, requiring the same output from f replicas will tolerate f – 1 faults. More complicated kinds of redundancy (such as error-correcting codes) are cheaper, but they depend on special properties of the service being provided.</p>
<p>In this section we explain how to coordinate the replicas in a fully general and highly fault tolerant way. Then we explore an optimization called ‘leases’ that makes the coordination very efficient in nearly all cases.</p>
<b><p>2.1 Coordinating the Replicas</p>
</b><p>How can we arrange for each replica to do the same thing? Adopting a scheme first proposed by Lamport [5], we build each replica as a deterministic state machine; this means that the transition relation is a function from (state, input) to (new state, output). It is customary to call one of these replicas a ‘process’. Several processes that start in the same state and see the same sequence of inputs will do the same thing, that is, end up in the same state and produce the same outputs. So all we need for high availability is to ensure that all the non-faulty processes see the same inputs. The technical term for this is ‘consensus’ (sometimes called ‘agreement’ or ‘reliable broadcast’). Informally, we say that several processes achieve consensus if they all agree on some value; we give a formal definition later on.</p>
<p>So if several processes are implementing the same deterministic state machine and achieve consensus on the values and order of the inputs, they will do the same thing. In this way it’s possible to replicate an arbitrary computation and thus make it highly available. Of course we can make the order a part of the input value by defining some total order on the set of inputs, for instance by numbering them 1, 2, 3, ... </p>
<p>In many applications the inputs are requests from clients to the replicated service. For example, a replicated storage service might have Read(a) and Write(a, d) inputs, and an airplane flight control system might have ReadInstrument(i) and RaiseFlaps(d) inputs. Different clients usually generate their requests independently, so it’s necessary to agree not only on what the requests are, but also on the order in which to serve them. The simplest way to do this is to number them with consecutive integers, starting at 1. This is done in ‘primary copy’ replication, since it’s easy for one process (the primary) to assign consecutive numbers. So the storage service will agree on Input 1 = Write(x, 3) and Input 2 = Read(x).</p>
<p>There are many other schemes for achieving consensus on the order of requests when their total order is not derived from consecutive integers; see Schneider’s survey [11]. These schemes label each input with some value from a totally ordered set (for instance, (client UID, timestamp) pairs) and then devise a way to be certain that you have seen all the inputs that can ever exist with labels smaller than a given value. This is complicated, and practical systems usually use a primary to sequence the inputs instead.</p>
<b><p>2.2 Leases: Efficient Highly Available Computing</p>
</b><p>Fault-tolerant consensus is expensive. Exclusive access by a single process (also known as locking) is cheap, but it is not fault-tolerant—if a process fails while it is holding a lock, no one else can access the resource. Adding a timeout to a lock makes a fault-tolerant lock or ‘lease’. Thus a process holds a lease on a state component or ‘resource’ until an expiration time; we say that the process is the ‘master’ for the resource while it holds the lease. No other process will touch the resource until the lease expires. For this to work, of course, the processes must have synchronized clocks. More precisely, if the maximum skew between the clocks of two processes is e and process P’s lease expires at time t, then P knows that no other process will touch the resource before time t – e on P’s clock.</p>
<p>While it holds the lease the master can read and write the resource freely. Writes must take bounded time, so that they can be guaranteed either to fail or to precede any operation that starts after the lease expires; this can be a serious problem for a resource such as a SCSI disk, which has weak ordering guarantees and a long upper bound on the time a write can take.</p>
<p>Locks in transaction processing systems are usually leases; if they expire the transaction is aborted, which means that its writes are undone and the transaction is equivalent to skip. A process that uses leases outside the scope of a transaction must take care to provide whatever atomicity is necessary, for example, by ensuring that the resource is in a good state after every atomic write (this is called ‘careful writes’), or by using standard redo or undo methods based on logs [4]. The latter is almost certainly necessary if the resource being leased is itself replicated.</p>
<p>A process can keep control of a resource by renewing its lease before it expires. It can also release its lease, perhaps on demand. If you can’t talk to the process that holds the lease, however (perhaps because it has failed), you have to wait for the lease to expire before touching its resource. So there is a tradeoff between the cost of renewing a lease and the time you have to wait for the lease to expire after a (possible) failure. A short lease means a short wait during recovery but a higher cost to renew the lease. A long lease means a long wait during recovery but a lower cost to renew.</p>
<p>A lease is most often used to give a process the right to cache some part of the state, for instance the contents of a cache line or of a file, knowing that it can’t change. Since a lease is a kind of lock, it can have a ‘mode’ which determines what operations its holder can do. If the lease is exclusive, then its process can change the leased state freely. This is like ‘owner’ access to a cache line or ownership of a multi-ported disk.</p>
<b><p>2.3 Hierarchical Leases</p>
</b><p>In a fault-tolerant system leases must be granted and renewed by running consensus. If this much use of consensus is still too expensive, the solution is hierarchical leases. Run consensus once to elect a czar <i>C</i> and give <i>C</i> a lease on a large part of the state. Now <i>C</i> gives out sub-leases on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> to masters. Each master controls its own resources. The masters renew their sub-leases with the czar. This is cheap since it doesn’t require any coordination. The czar renews its lease by consensus. This costs more, but there’s only one czar lease. Also, the czar can be simple and less likely to fail, so a longer lease may be acceptable. </p>
<p>Hierarchical leases are commonly used in replicated file systems and in clusters.</p>
<p>By combining the ideas of consensus, leases, and hierarchy, it’s possible to build highly available systems that are also highly efficient.</p>
<b><span size="4"><p>3. Consensus</p>
</span></b><p>Several processes achieve consensus if they all agree on some allowed value called the ‘outcome’ (if they could agree on any value the solution would be trivial: always agree on 0). Thus the …</p></div>
