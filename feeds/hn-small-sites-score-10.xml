<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>The notion of programming paradigms, with associated programming languages and methodologies, is a well established tenet of Computer Science pedagogy, enshrined in international curricula. However,this notion sits ill with Kuhn’s classic conceptualisation of a scientific paradigm as a dominant world view, which supersedes its predecessors through superior explanatory power.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is not at all clear how programming paradigms are to be characterised and differentiated. Indeed, on closer inspection, apparently disparate programming paradigms are very strongly connected. Rather, they should be viewed as different traditions of a unitary Computer Science paradigm of Turing complete computation complemented by Computational Thinking.</p>

            Everyone Is Beautiful and No One Is Horny    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Modern action and superhero films fetishize the body, even as they desexualize it.</strong></h4>



<p><strong>by RS Benedict</strong></p>



<p>When Paul Verhoeven adapted <em>Starship Troopers</em> in the late 1990s, did he know he was predicting the future? The endless desert war, the ubiquity of military propaganda, a cheerful face shouting victory as more and more bodies pile up?</p>



<p>But the scene that left perhaps the greatest impact on the minds of Nineties kids—and the scene that anticipated our current cinematic age the best—does not feature bugs or guns. It is, of course, the shower scene, in which our heroic servicemen and -women enjoy a communal grooming ritual.</p>



<p>On the surface, it is idyllic: racial harmony, gender equality, unity behind a common goal—and firm, perky asses and tits.</p>



<p>And then the characters speak. The topic of conversation? Military service, of course. One joined for the sake of her political career. Another joined in the hopes of receiving her breeding license. Another talks about how badly he wants to kill the enemy. No one looks at each other. No one flirts.</p>



<p>A room full of beautiful, bare bodies, and everyone is only horny for war.</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, there was a brief period where actresses pretended that their thinness was natural, almost accidental. Skinny celebrities confessed their love of burgers and fries in magazines; models undergoing profile interviews engaged in public consumption of pasta; leading ladies joked about how little they exercised and how much they hated it. It was all bullshit: no one looks like that without calorie restriction. We knew it then, and we know it now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don’t pretend anymore. The promotional cycles for blockbuster movies now include detailed descriptions of the performers’ fitness regimens. We watch actors doing burpees or shaking ropes with expensive personal trainers. There is some talk of diets, though not terribly detailed—and no mention of steroids or other hormonal supplements, even though male actors’ suddenly ultra-swole selfies on Instagram suggest physiques crafted with chemical assistance.</p>



<p>Actors are more physically perfect than ever: impossibly lean, shockingly muscular, with magnificently coiffed hair, high cheekbones, impeccable surgical enhancements, and flawless skin, all displayed in form-fitting superhero costumes with the obligatory shirtless scene thrown in to show off shredded abs and rippling pecs.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Even background extras are good-looking, or at least inoffensively bland. No one is ugly. No one is really fat. Everyone is beautiful.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And this isn’t just the lead and the love interest: supporting characters look this way too, and even villains (frequently clad in monstrous makeup) are still played by conventionally attractive performers. Even background extras are good-looking, or at least inoffensively bland. No one is ugly. No one is really fat. Everyone is beautiful.</p>



<p>And yet, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/marvel-movies-this-esteemed-director-says-theyre-not-sexy-enough.html/"><strong>no one is horny</strong></a>. Even when they have sex, no one is horny. No one is attracted to anyone else. No one is hungry for anyone else.</p>



<p>When revisiting a beloved Eighties or Nineties film, Millennial and Gen X viewers are often startled to encounter long-forgotten sexual content content: John Connor’s conception in <em>Terminator</em>, Jamie Lee Curtis’s toplessness in <em>Trading Places</em>, the spectral blowjob in <em>Ghostbusters</em>. These scenes didn’t shock us when we first saw them. Of <em>course </em>there’s sex in a movie. Isn’t there always?</p>



<p>The answer, of course, is not anymore—at least not when it comes to modern blockbusters</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="319" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-300x188.jpg 300w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px"></figure></div>



<p>We’re told that Tony Stark and Pepper Potts are an item, but no actual romantic or sexual chemistry between them is shown in the films. Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor utterly lack the sexual chemistry to convince us that either of them would be thirsty enough to commandeer a coma victim’s body (as they do in <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em>) so they can enjoy a posthumous hookup. In defiance of Norse mythology, Chris Hemsworth’s Thor<em> </em>smiles at Natalie Portman like a dumb golden retriever puppy without ever venturing to rend her asunder with his mighty hammer, so to speak. Not that the competition is any better. Despite accusations of being an incel icon, it is Heath Ledger’s Joker, not Christian Bale’s chaste and sexless Batman, who exudes the most sexual energy in the Dark Knight trilogy.</p>



<p>And speaking of Christopher Nolan’s inexplicably sexless oeuvre—did anyone else think it odd how <em>Inception </em>enters the deepest level of a rich man’s subconscious and finds <em>not </em>a psychosexual Oedipal nightmare of staggering depravity, but… a ski patrol?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Let’s not pretend that Old Hollywood was a progressive haven of body positivity. Since the departure of voluptuous vamp Theda Bara from the silver screen, actors have always gone to extremes to maintain a certain look. Rita Hayworth underwent an ethnic makeover to appear more Caucasian so she could get leading roles. Stars of the 1920s limited their fluid consumption to two glasses a day to avoid water weight. Jane Fonda suffered from severe bulimia at the height of her sex symbol status; so did Marlon Brando.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Snake Plissken didn’t fuck on screen, but the character radiates overwhelming sex-haver energy.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But old films still featured recognizable human bodies and human faces—bodies that could theoretically be achieved by a single person without the aid of a team of personal trainers, dieticians, private chefs, and chemists.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="252" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-1300x650.jpg 1300w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px"></figure></div>



<p>In the films of the Eighties and Nineties, leading actors were good looking, yes, but still human. Kurt Russel’s Snake Plissken was a hunk, but in shirtless scenes his abs have no definition. Bruce Willis was handsome, but he’s more muscular now than he was in the Nineties, when he was routinely branded a bona fide sex symbol. And when Isabella Rosselini strips in <em>Blue Velvet</em>, her skin is pale and her body is soft. She looks vulnerable and real.</p>



<p>And yet, these characters fucked. <em>Blue Velvet’s </em>Dorothy Vallens and Jeffrey Beaumant fucked. Michael Keaton’s Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer’s domme Catwoman fucked. Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fucked. Snake Plissken didn’t fuck on screen, but the character radiates overwhelming sex-haver energy. And I defy you to find a mainstream film with a moment as horny and gay as the <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-true-story-of-the-lost-boys-sax-man-1842774832"><strong>Sexy Saxophone Solo</strong></a> from <em>The Lost Boys</em>.</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Seen today, one of the most striking scenes in 1982’s Poltergeist is not the evil clown doll or the monster tree, but a moment of relaxed affection between the parents. The father—a bald, beer-bellied Craig T. Nelson—cracks jokes and prances for his wife, who wears a frumpy nightgown and smokes a joint and yammers weed thoughts and laughs at her husband’s silly display. Finally, the husband playfully dives onto the bed. Neither character is glamorous in this scene, but their relationship feels frisky and lived-in and charismatic and <em>real</em>.</p>



<p>The house looks real, too. There are toys and magazines scattered around the floor. There are cardboard boxes waiting to be unpacked since the recent move. Framed pictures rest against the wall; the parents haven’t gotten around to mounting them yet. The kitchen counters are cluttered and mealtimes are rambunctious and sloppy, as one expects in a house with three children. They’re building a pool in the backyard, but not for appearances: it’s a place for the kids to swim, for the parents to throw parties, and for the father to reacquaint himself with his love of diving.</p>



<p>At the time, this house represented an aspirational ideal of American affluence.</p>



<p>Compare this to homes in films now: massive, sterile cavernous spaces with minimalist furniture. Kitchens are industrial-sized and spotless, and they contain no food. There is no excess. There is no mess.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>A body is no longer a holistic system. It is not the vehicle through which we experience joy and pleasure. It is not a home to live in and be happy.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In her blog McMansion Hell, Kate Wagner examines precisely why these widely-hated 5000-square foot housing bubble behemoths are so awful. Over and over again, she reiterates the point that McMansions are not built to be homes; they’re built to be short-term investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mcmansionhell.com/post/150597521816/mcmansions-101-revisited-aesthetics-aside-why"><strong>Kate writes</strong></a>, “The inside of McMansions are designed in order to cram the most ‘features’ inside for the lowest costs.” These features exist to increase the house’s resale value, not to make it a good place to live. No thought is given to the labor needed to clean and maintain these spaces. The master bathroom includes intricate stone surfaces that can only be scrubbed with a toothbrush; the cathedral ceilings in the living room raise the heating and cooling costs to an exorbitant sum; the chandelier in the grand entryway dangles so high that no one can replace the bulbs in it, even with a stepladder.</p>



<p>The same fate has befallen our bodies. A body is no longer a holistic system. It is not the vehicle through which we experience joy and pleasure during our brief time in the land of the living. It is not a home to live in and be happy. It, too, is a collection of features: six pack, thigh gap, cum gutters. And these features exist not to make our lives more comfortable, but to increase the value of our assets. Our bodies are investments, which must always be optimized to bring us… what, exactly? Some vague sense of better living? Is a life without bread objectively better than a life with it? When we were children, did we dream of counting every calorie and logging every step?</p>



<p>A generation or two ago, it was normal for adults to engage in sports not purely as self-improvement but as an act of leisure. People danced for fun; couples socialized over tennis; kids played stickball for lack of anything else to do. Solitary exercise at the gym also had a social, rather than moral, purpose. People worked out to look hot so they could attract other hot people and fuck them. Whatever the ethos …</p></div></div>

<p>Street lighting systems is an example of where a wireless mesh network is needed. A single-hop network would not provide enough coverage, so the lights help each other to reach&nbsp;out.</p>

<p>The picture above shows an installation of a <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/why-iot-platform/" target="_blank">Thingsquare IoT platform</a> IPv6 mesh in the wild. (Although our system is known to be able to run on really, tiny devices operated by a <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/sensortag-power/" target="_blank">single coin-cell battery</a>, this particular installation does not use those low-power mechanisms as street lights have access to&nbsp;power.)</p>
<p>The big challenge with such a large wireless network is to understand what is going on – and how to develop the software that makes them&nbsp;tick.</p>
<p>In this article we look into how we develop such large-scale systems at Thingsquare and the tools we use. We push the envelope with a 100-hop network, which is larger than what we typically would see in real-world&nbsp;installations.</p>


<h2 id="a-100-node-wireless-testbed">A 100-Node Wireless&nbsp;Testbed</h2>
<p>To see what happens in a 100-hop network, we have built a testbed in our office. The testbed consists of  100 wireless nodes placed in a bookshelf. The nodes all use the <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/CC2538" target="_blank"><span>TI</span> CC2538 wireless System-on-a-Chip</a>, running the Thingsquare wireless mesh over a <span>IEEE</span> 802.15.4e low-power radio layer. The nodes are powered by USB, but otherwise have only a wireless connection. Each node also has an LED, which we use to develop and test our wireless lighting system. By default, the nodes form one large wireless&nbsp;network.</p>

A 100-node testbed and the wireless mesh network created by the nodes in the&nbsp;testbed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Because every node in the testbed is close to each other, they can easily form a single-hop network. That is, every node can reach every other node without&nbsp;meshing.</p>
<p>To setup a 100-hop network, we manually configure their routes. This way, we can force the system to become a 100-hop&nbsp;network.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-100-hops">Setting up 100&nbsp;Hops</h3>
<p>After configuring the system to have a 100-hop structure, the mesh looks like&nbsp;this:</p>

<p>

</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>We now have a way to test the system with 100 hops, something that is beyond anything we are likely to see in the&nbsp;wild.</p>
<h3 id="100-hops-in-action">100 Hops in&nbsp;Action</h3>
<p>To see the 100 hops in action, we set up one node to act as a sniffer and run Wireshark to capture the packets from the network. We then ask the node that is 100 hops away to make a secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank"><span>TLS</span> connection</a> with the backend. In the Wireshark logs, we see the <span>TLS</span> traffic as well as the ICMPv6 control traffic that is used by the RPL routing protocol to set up and maintain its routing&nbsp;graph.</p>
<p>(For more in-depth information about the <span>RPL</span> IPv6 routing protocol, see <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/docs/mesh/" target="_blank">this article</a> from our&nbsp;docs.)</p>

<p>If we look at the traffic inside the network, we can see how the packets move from node to node, in a snake-like&nbsp;manner:</p>

<p>
Packets move through every node in the network, 100 hops in&nbsp;total.

<h2 id="in-the-simulator">In the&nbsp;Simulator</h2>
<p>A wireless mesh system is extremely complex and while a testbed is essential to testing the system, it is not enough for developing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>To develop our wireless mesh system, we use our wireless network simulator. The simulator lets us set up the same environment as we see in the real world, but on a single computer. There, we can inspect almost every aspect of the system to see what is going&nbsp;on.</p>

The Cooja wireless network&nbsp;simulator.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>To see a similar behavior as we did our testbed, we set up a simulation with a regular grid of nodes and configure them in a similar fashion as we did in the testbed: they choose parents in the routing graph to make the network as long as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>The simulator also lets us see the packets in a timeline window, where we can see exactly what each node does at any given&nbsp;time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wireless mesh networking allow us to build extremely large-scale networks. But such networks are complex and to build the software that make them tick, we need both hardware testbeds and software&nbsp;simulators.</p>

What a year it’s been! Shortly after we posted the article, the rest of 2020 quickly became a very strange year. Like everyone else, we endured moving our entire team over to remote working and the challenges that brings from artistic to technical hurdles. Fortunately even though the whole world came to a crashing halt, we continued to produce animation. But more importantly, software development for the Mac continued and we’re now entering a very exciting time with more support than ever for professional tools designed for the Mac Pro which really begin to take advantage of its power.</p></div><div data-aspect-ratio="45.370370370370374" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612621230889_28058"><div>

</div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612636471491_143700"><div><p>As we specialise in 3D computer animation, the software we use isn’t always obvious and there are a few different options out there. So we thought we would list out what we currently use at the studio for production and it will give context to aspects of the piece when referring to software support and new software options we’ve been testing. These are all industry standard pieces of software used to create most TV and feature films.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612636471491_654466"><div><p>So you get your new Mac Pro, unbox it and plug it in. You install all the software you were using on your previous machine. At first in many ways it feels familiar, you’re staring at the same macOS, but then you realise you’ve got deadlines to meet and need to get working on your CGI shots, whether that’s character animation, simulation, lighting and rendering. Suddenly the only thing that matters is the content you’re making and that’s what we’re going to look at – the noticeable things that this machine really helps with once you start working as an artist.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613091298668_83819"><div><p>OK, we all know the machine is fast and it should be, I mean the spec says it is. However when you’re working on a 3D animation project, you’re dealing with really heavy 3D scenes, that are carrying millions of polygons of geometry, characters, lights. A great example of a project like this is a commercial we made at the end of 2020, with our partners over at<a href="https://roger.tv/"> Roger</a> in LA for the<a href="https://www.hulu.com/hulu-disney-espn-bundle-offer"> Disney Bundle</a>. It was a challenging project that involved shots which had an entire city with people and cars, along with elements of pretty much every major IP you can think of. You can watch the commercial below to give you context:</p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612722024119_310147"><div><p>On an iMac Pro workstation you might struggle to open a scene like this, but on the Mac Pro we’re able to actively work on the scene with multiple applications open at the same time.</p><p>What this means is that rather than having to close the heavy scene, load up the 3D model we want to adjust and then close that and reopen the original scene to continue working, we are able to simply switch spaces in macOS, add a light to a 3D model and quickly switch back and check the update with the interactive IPR renderer.</p><p>Then while we’re waiting for that to create a preview render, we can switch over to another screen and adjust another model.</p><p>What we’re seeing here is the fluidity of the artist working and not having to be ground to a halt because the computer is having to think. It feels like having multiple computers at your fingertips. All without constant crashing, which means we avoid losing work and more importantly save artists’ time.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613091298668_214984"><p>Above you can see a video we have recorded to try and showcase what this is like when working on something like this. Anybody that works professionally in this field will appreciate that being able to continuously work without getting bogged down is incredibly exciting.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612621230889_59119"><div><p>If you’re a technical effects artist then you’ll be used to working in a piece of software like Houdini and spending your time constantly setting off simulations, whether that’s liquid or smoke simulations and these are all widely known to be very slow to create. On a daily basis you might be submitting those to a render farm in the studio for other computers to evaluate while you continue working on something else.</p><p>However we’ve noticed while working on the Mac Pro, you can easily simulate in the background while continuing to work, all without seeing any major performance hits. The video below demonstrates adjusting a simulation and setting another one off while continuing to work on another scene.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612722024119_591326"><div><p>Depending on the type of simulation you’re doing you can run more than one, based on whether the simulation is using the CPU or GPU to do the calculation. For example cloth and grain is typically calculated using the GPU, and if you have four GPUs in your Mac Pro then you can utilise all of them working away in the background.</p><p>This kind of workflow is something that has become evidently more important in the last 12 months since our artists have been working remotely away from the studio. One of the challenges with effects and simulations is the amount of data that is created in a simulation cache. It’s easy to create frames that are a gigabyte each and suddenly you need to be able to upload terabytes of data back to the studio to render. The ability to work on a Mac Pro and feel like you have a little renderfarm inside is extremely powerful.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612722024119_811766"><div><p>If you’re a character animator, performance is always very important, because every time you want to see your characters move you don’t want to have to play-blast it, which essentially means rendering the animation out to a video file to be able to preview.</p><p>As you can imagine this slows the animator down and play-blasting is often common practice if you have multiple characters in a 3D scene. So we wanted to take a look at what animation performance improvements we get out of the door when working with characters on a Mac Pro. The video to the right is the cinematic for Gods of Olympus. We’ll be looking at one of the shots from the cinematic with nine characters and how it performs with playback.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613091298668_258695"><p>So all nine characters playback at real time 24 frames per second (The frame number fluctuates but this is common when hitting the play button it can take a while to settle down). Which is very impressive for so many characters in a Maya scene. In the video you will also see that if we turn on cached playback which essentially saves the characters movement in the 3D scene and is intelligent so it will only need to re-cache the changes that are made as you animate. With this turned on and along with ‘Play Every Frame, Free’ which uncaps the speed of playback we now see up to 50 frames per second.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612636471491_396815"><div><p>One of the really nice things about the Pro Display XDR is the size and resolution. Typically with 3D animation software, they always seem to have multiple windows, graphs, node editors and viewports, due to their complexity and managing all of these windows can be tricky. It’s relatively common for animators to use a second display when working. However at our studio most of our artists use a single 27inch 5K iMac Pros. The reality when using larger displays from a 27” and upwards is that you really have to turn your head to look from one monitor to the other while working and with the ability in macOS to easily switch between screens (or another space), that need for a second display starts to disappear. The only challenge if working on a single screen is being able to fit all of the animation controls into that single display comfortably. Now with a 6K 32” display we might have the perfect balance.</p><p>So we have laid out the typical character animation setup in Maya on both a 27” 5K iMac Pro and 32inch Pro Display XDR and how this looks from an operational point of view. The additional screen real estate is immediately giving the animator an entire character picker without losing any or the perspective or camera views in the scene. You can click each image to see it in its full resolution. Being able to fit all of this on a single display is amazing for animating with and this kind of benefit is the same with other workflows like effects and simulation, lighting and rendering.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612722024119_1134798"><div><p><br>We wanted to elaborate on the P3-DCI support with the Pro Display XDR, I know in our last blog post we described the new monitor as a game changer when we were working on the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7975244/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">Jumanji:The Next Level</a> end titles at the time of receiving the new Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR.</p><p>P3-DCI is not a format that is going to be used by most creatives out there, you need to be working on feature film content designed for the American film industry, but for a studio like ourselves, now having three of the displays within the studio gives us the ability to do something we simply couldn’t before. </p></div></div></div><div><div data-aspect-ratio="52.87037037037037" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612649579666_554134"><div>

<p><a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/"><em>The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect</em></a> is a collaborative effort aimed at a general audience by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl">Judea Pearl</a>, a professor of computer science at UCLA, and <a href="http://danamackenzie.com/">Dana Mackenzie</a>, a science writer. As a medical student with a laughably poor formal education in statistics, I believe I qualify as a card-carrying member of the general audience. Here's my review in three parts: i) an overview of topics covered by the book, ii) my thoughts, and iii) links to other reviews and further reading.</p>
<p>The book grounds Pearl's theoretical work on causal inference in a multitude of realistic and real examples, drawn from a range of disciplines including economics, biology, and law. Pearl himself is a pretty <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/pearl_2658896.cfm">Big Deal</a> in computer science. Throughout the book, he demonstrates how his causal methods can be applied to many diverse fields of research, but it's clear that what excites him the most is its potential in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>What is causal inference? When we perform scientific studies, we're often interested in the relationship between variables (treatments, risk factors, diseases, outcomes). Scientific studies that investigate these relationships can be divided into two types: observational and interventional. Observational studies can identify associations, but they cannot tell you anything about the direction of that association. There may be other variables that distort your results by concealing a true relationship, or worse, by generating false ones. That's why researchers turn to interventional studies as a more reliable source of evidence—specifically, randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The problem is, RCTs are not always ethical or feasible, and they require more resources to set up and run. Enter the exciting field of causal inference, which aims to answer questions about cause and effect from observational data.</p>
<p>A brief word on what causal inference is <em>not</em>—this is something that took me a while to wrap my head around. Causal inference doesn't tell us from scratch what the causes of an event are. Nor is it able to "prove" that one variable caused another. Those questions belong to the realm of causal <em>discovery</em>. Instead, causal inference aims to draw richer interpretations beyond mere associations from observational data. We can answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of these variables actually affect the outcome?</li>
<li>What is the magnitude of effect of each individual treatment variable on the outcome?</li>
<li>What are the mechanisms underlying a complex problem such as cancer?</li>
</ul>
<p>The catch is that, whether explicitly or implicitly, you must make
assumptions in the first place about the directions of causality among the variables. In many cases, the data can <em>support</em> your assumptions, but any
relationships you observe in the data without considering these prior
assumptions are purely correlation. And you know the drill,
<em>correlation is not causation</em>...</p>
<p>There are many approaches to causal inference, of which Pearl's is
characterised by two techniques: graphs (DAGs) and <em>do</em>-calculus. More
on that in a minute.</p>
<h2>Ladder of causation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Rung 1: Associations, observational data (seeing)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rung 2: Intervention (doing)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rung 3: Counterfactuals (imagining)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pearl proposes this framework which we can use to categorise the various techniques of causal inference. At the bottom lies passive observation of a system,
allowing us to find direction-free associations. The next rung up is
intervention: by explicitly setting the values of treatment variables,
we abolish the effects of confounders. This is even more effective
with randomisation, which is why RCTs are hailed as the gold standard
of scientific studies.</p>
<p>Going beyond intervention is the idea of the counterfactual, or
<em>what-if</em> thinking. If this person had never smoked, would he
still have gotten lung cancer? Counterfactuals are subtly but
crucially different from interventions. These hypothetical questions
pertain to what might have been, and cannot actually happen in the real
world. We can intervene by stopping that person with lung cancer from
smoking now, but we can't erase that lung cancer patient's 50-year history of smoking, which is the counterfactual question we're asking in this
case. Think of counterfactuals as parallel universes. Counterfactuals strengthen the case for a causal relationship:
if <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> causes <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, then <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> shouldn't happen in the abscence of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Of
course, things are rarely this simple in real life, and the authors also discuss <em>necessary</em> and <em>sufficienct</em> causes.</p>
<h2>DAGs</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a> stands for "directed acyclic graph". A DAG is simply a diagram
containing nodes that are connected by edges (lines) with directions,
and tracing these edges according to their directions should not result in a closed loop. In causal analysis, DAGs are used to represent
the relationships between variables in a system, with the directed
edges indicating the (assumed) direction of causation.</p>
<p>Pearl is a vocal proponent of graphical models in causal
inference. DAGs, he argues, are much more intuitive than algrebraic
expressions in illustrating complex problems. Importantly, DAGs can
clearly tell us which variables should be controlled for and which
ones should be left as they are. Confounders (common causes) are commonly defined as variables that are associated with both the treatment variable and the outcome variable, and everyone knows we need to control for confounders. However, there are in fact other types of variables that are associated with both the treatment and the outcome that should <em>not</em> be controlled for. A common example is collider variables (common effects); controlling for a collider will create a spurious association between treatment and outcome, where there was previously none. DAGs are
invaluable in highlighting these potential pitfalls as our models get
more complex.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/clinjasn/12/3/546/F3.large.jpg">here</a> for graphical representations of confounders, mediators, and colliders.</p>
<h2><em>do</em>-calculus</h2>
<p><em>do</em>-calculus is the other pillar of Pearl's approach to causal
inference, refined over the years by his students. I have to admit
that this entire topic has flown right over my head, and the authors don't
make it easy to follow in the book. Reading about how <em>do</em>-calculus
was derived and how it may be used felt a lot like "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl">How to Draw An
Owl"</a> material.</p>
<p>At a high level, <em>do</em>-calculus is basically a formalised, mathematical
way of expressing interventions in contrast to observations. Conditional probabilities contain no information about causality. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>∣</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(A \mid B)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> represents the probability of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given that <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is <em>observed</em>, a concept that lies at the bottom rung of Pearl's Ladder of Causation. To show the probability of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when you cause <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to happen in an experiment, you would write <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>[</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>∣</mo><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P[A \mid do(B)]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> instead. When you're able to manipulate a treatment variable statistically, you can also delete arrows pointing towards it in a DAG, which may reveal new confounders, colliders, and mediators. Using <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/350267/a-layman-understanding-of-the-difference-between-back-door-and-front-door-adjust">front-door adjustment</a>, we can also control for <em>unobserved</em> confounders, which is pretty darn nifty.</p>
<h2>Topics</h2>
<p>As its subtitle suggests, <em>The Book of Why</em> is ambitious in scope and
touches upon a dizzying array of seminal ideas from the 19th and 20th
century. These are the main topics covered in each chapter (paraphrased by me to be more informative; not actual titles).</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: Pearl's Ladder of Causation</li>
<li>Chapter 2: Sewall Wright and path analysis, a major
influence on Pearl</li>
<li>Chapter 3: Bayes' theorem and Pearl's work on Bayesian
networks</li>
<li>Chapter 4: Confounders, mediators, colliders, and back-door adjustment</li>
<li>Chapter 5: How causal inference could have resolved the
smoking-and-cancer debate</li>
<li>Chapter 6: Causal inference applied to statistical paradoxes
(Monty Hall problem, Simpson's paradox, Berkson's paradox, Lord's
paradox)</li>
<li>Chapter 7: <em>do</em>-calculus, front-door adjustment, and instrumental variables</li>
<li>Chapter 8: Counterfactuals, potential outcomes, and structural
equation modelling</li>
<li>Chapter 9: Mediation analysis</li>
<li>Chapter 10: The role of causal inference in Big Data and AI</li>
</ul>
<h2>My thoughts on <em>The Book of Why</em></h2>
<p>Let's start with the obvious. This book dwells on the history of statistics a lot, and statisticians, as the authors would have you believe, are zealots who have conspired to keep causal thinking out of their field right from the start. That is, until Pearl instigated the "Causal Revolution", as he dubs it, the latest and greatest gift to modern science. I have no dog in this fight, but Pearl (whom I assume is the source of most of these opinions put to paper by Mackenzie) often comes across as wildly biased and grandiose. For what it's worth, I doubt that statisticians as a whole are anywhere as malicious or ignorant as they're portrayed in this book.</p>
<p>I'm confused about the intended audience. This book is
simultaneously too simplistic for experts and too technical for
lay people (i.e. me). I suspect the ideal reader lies somewhere in between: someone with a solid grasp of basic statistics and maths who is interested in causal analysis. The authors' contempt and mischaracterisations of the entire field of statistics are unlikely to sit well with said reader, though.</p>
<p>There are many minor errors in the edition I have, including some
inexplicably basic ones that conflate odds and probability, but <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/errata-pages-PearlMackenzie_BookofWhy_Final.pdf">this
PDF</a> contains the errata.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with what I got out of this book, I
think. While
Pearl's opinion of statistics and of his own work are on extreme ends of a
spectrum, and similarly irksome, there is much to celebrate in
this strange tome. I really appreciate the breadth of topics and historical anecdotes that feature here, sprinkled with a healthy dash of philosophy. I'm also very intrigued about the applications of causal inference in biomedical research, and this book has led me to the opening of many tantalising rabbit holes. However, I strongly recommend reading Pearl's technical overview instead (link below), which is very similar to <em>The Book of Why</em>, but more concise and palatable.</p>

</div><p>Voters in Switzerland have thrown out a law governing a proposed&nbsp;electronic identity system. The result is&nbsp; a blow for plans by parliament and the government amid fears about data protection.</p>

</time><address data-uk-scrollspy="hidden: false; repeat: true; offset-top: -50">

</address><p>Final results show 64.4% of voters coming out against the planned law on Sunday.&nbsp;The rejection rate among the cantons ranged between 70.7% and 55.8%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At stake was the creation of the legal basis for a digital identity verification system, to be licenced and controlled by the state but provided mainly by private companies.</p><p>The single access point is aimed at simplifying the use of online services offered by commercial businesses as well as contact with public institutions via e-government channels.</p>
<p>“Mistrust in private companies was&nbsp;dominant and helped to tip the vote,”&nbsp;said political scientist Urs Bieri of the GfS Bern research institute on SRF public radio.</p><p>Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter acknowledged “a certain unease”&nbsp;among voters. She called on parliament and critics of the failed plan to now cooperate to avoid a standstill.</p><p>“We have no choice and must work towards a new solution, even if it takes several attempts,”&nbsp;she told a news conference. “It is key for Switzerland to catch up with other countries when it comes digitalisation.”</p><p>Daniel Graf of the referendum committee said voters had not come out against a digital identity scheme but only against the proposed solution. Green Party parliamentarian Sibel Arslan, who also opposed the law, said voters made it clear that they want an eID provided only by the&nbsp;government and under democratic control.</p><p>People's Party parliamentarian&nbsp;Franz Grüter, a supporter of the failed electronic identity scheme, said he was disappointed but is confident that a solution&nbsp;can be found for a new proposal.</p>
<h2>Civil society group</h2><p>The law at stake was approved by parliament in 2019 but then <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/data-security-issue-causes-concern-over-swiss-digital-id/46300224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenged to a referendum</a>&nbsp;by an alliance of civil society groups, backed by trade unions as well as left-wing and some centrist parties.</p><p>The opponents argued the state should not be limited to acting as a licensing and oversight authority but that it should take full responsibility. The risk of data abuse by commercial providers would undermine the effort to make digitalisation more democratic, they say.</p><p>That said, the need for some form of an eID for the business community was not contested by opponents. Switzerland is lagging behind many European countries following unsuccessful attempts over the past decades to set up a single login system for users of online services.</p>
<h2>No capacity</h2><p>The government, which launched the bill three years ago, had said the proposed law sets the basis for a secure online login system.</p><p>During the campaign, Keller-Sutter praised the law as&nbsp;a compromise, sharing out the tasks between the state and the private sector.</p><p>Supporters of the law also pointed out that almost no government has the IT capacity and resources to single-handedly develop an eID quickly and to the appropriate standards.</p><p>A previous attempt to set up a public-private e-identity solution, known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/orell-fuessli_swiss-passport-printer-meets-digital-id-challenge-head-on/45697922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuisseID</a>, failed more than ten years ago.</p><h2>Complex and Covid</h2><p>The relative complexity of the issue at stake made it challenging for citizens to form their opinion, said Lukas Golder, co-director of the GfS Bern research institute.</p><p>Doubts over the practical use of the eID and concerns about potential data abuse have been overwhelming, he said.</p>
<p>Several political scientists also pointed out that opposition to the law was a protest vote against the government and its anti-Covid policy.</p><p>Keller-Sutter said&nbsp;the current restrictions on public gatherings due to the pandemic had made campaigning and face-to-face meeting with voters more difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>Public attention also appeared to focus more on the other issues up for vote on Sunday: a proposal to <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss--burka-ban--vote-too-close-to-call/46420534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban facial coverings, including the burka</a>, and to a lesser extent, a <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-direct-democracy-could-undo-a-free-trade-deal-with-indonesia/46422650" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial free trade deal</a> between Switzerland and Indonesia, the world’s top producer of palm oil.</p><div role="region" aria-label="Infobox"><h2>Votes March 7, 2021</h2><p>Ban on facial covering/Burka:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51.2% yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 48.8% no</p><p>Digital identification/eID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35.6% yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64.4% no</p><p>Free trade accord with Indonesia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51.6.% yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 48.4% no</p><p>Turnout: 51.4%</p><p>About 5.5 million Swiss citizens, including registered expat Swiss, were eligible to take part in the votes.</p><p>There were also numerous ballots at cantonal and local levels on March 7.</p><p><span>End of insertion</span></p></div> </section>

        <p><em>Hiâ€”Dan here. We're continuing Justin Mares's column on side businesses today! You can read previous editions </em><a href="https://every.to/@jwmares" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Before starting <a href="http://kettleandfire.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kettle &amp; Fire</a>, I had a previous life in the SaaS world. I ran growth for a team (Exceptional Cloud Services)&nbsp; that bought small SaaS apps and grew them. We later sold the bundle of businesses to Rackspace for 8 figures, in early 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>When I left Rackspace after the acquisition and went out on my own, I wanted to replicate the model weâ€™d seen so much success with at Exceptional. I wanted to buy and grow my own SaaS business.&nbsp;</p><p>My partner Ryan and I were on the lookout for a business that fulfilled one of the <a href="https://every.to/superorganizers/the-four-kinds-of-side-hustles-2083436" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">side hustle criteria</a> Iâ€™ve written about before. A strong potential acquisition had to:</p><ul><li>Solve a problem someone is already aware of,</li><li>In a niche where customers are already paying,</li><li>Where the product <em>does not</em> require a lot of maintenance or hand-holding,</li><li>And is profitable or has a no-brainer path to profitability</li></ul><p>In early 2016, we stumbled across Notify: a simple Shopify plugin that would pop up at the bottom of a website, displaying a purchase another customer had recently made.</p><p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/snCfaj5_C-1syTXy4LkPpzKMFBlQ52St0OM2P3E_zqzUVp9_Wt58QG4D2o6G3nuXYiamO1LNNi1b_cicP1781j0-BxSHMr0-XxKpoP7qY0ADq-Vq_xrId6tVHnM6keJxQ87B5CSD"></p><p>Once I saw it in action, I immediately installed it on <a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kettle &amp; Fire</a> and saw a 40% lift in conversionâ€¦ and $1,400 in extra sales (this was 2016â€¦ K&amp;F was a lot smaller then ðŸ™ƒ).</p><p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XaXoTmu3NxGZOEawmBfaPUhytLba2rid3i3Wf6PfomzNiAukmhLSZl-Mu3RFSjQtwZRFE8hle4yE2Ty1y5jHEkCJPv7VfoPxsaQ0cNbkiTu84Vw5JCHa4rF-JYCLi9f5haDumRSe"></p><p>Woah.&nbsp;</p><p>If it helped my site this much, how many others see a similar sales lift? We had a strong hunch that we could buy Notify, add a few features, put some marketing behind it and grow it quite a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 1, we fired off this email:</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HEMvbe7q_x7pz90iv_OjztnMmZgiPL4Pw_QjIlFmh84HsiEX8XA6Q7UuNKALqkx_mmBMZNaufWI_SjIj2JI1Qa8B09dw63vBWYFTiek2YFbd5uZM8-ACoIlpDIq7awjpG6jOm3p4"></p><p>Buying an app, no matter how small, is a lot of work. Iâ€™d tried to purchase other software businesses in the past and understood how hard it was to come to an agreement. The process involves a good bit of legal spend and can fall apart at the drop of a hat: lessons learned after spending $10k on legal for a failed acquisition 12 months prior ðŸ¤¦.&nbsp;</p><p>We first wanted to see how serious Notifyâ€™s owner, Scott, was about selling. We emailed him and grabbed dinner just one week after our first email exchange.</p><p>During dinner, Ryan and I expressed our admiration for what Scott had accomplishedâ€”which was truly impressive. We covered our backgrounds, and shared the many ideas we had for the product that could take it to the next level.&nbsp;</p><p>Dinner went swimmingly and we learned a LOT about the product. Within a day or two, we followed up with super early diligence questions:</p><p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oQNRoVWMgHJ3bEzzDTXffQnVO1ipHtGFyUQkSqBy-M56RTL8wJ1ZL_xE-Aq9caFXoz5FtlQ4Aoa_ON-04u3Su5s4y1A2zT5vIFCznVUFurYclJy1whYDgqmHXXvSyJ2AzJexRqbS"></p><p>After taking four days to review the numbers he sent over, we responded with a Letter of Intent: a legal but non-binding letter showing we were serious about buying the business. An LOI also serves to ensure that both parties are aligned on high-level terms: what weâ€™d pay, when those payments would hit, etc.&nbsp;</p><h2>Actually buying the business</h2><p>Letâ€™s pause here for a second to address some common misconceptions.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it may feel like youâ€™re listening to Uncle Warren Buffett espousing the benefits and strong returns that come from buying a railroad. <em>Thanks Warren, but how the hell does this apply to me?&nbsp;</em></p><p>The truth is, you donâ€™t need a lot (or any) money to buy many of these small businesses. Many small businesses you can actually buy for $0 up front, if you negotiate it properly and find a motivated seller. Where revenue is less than $20K per month, many of the businesses youâ€™re looking at arenâ€™t businesses at all: theyâ€™re jobs. And if you find an owner (like we did) who wants to quit his job, you can make a deal happen. Youâ€™ll get what you want (a revenue-generating business), the seller gets what he wants (his time back and money for his efforts), and everybody wins.&nbsp;</p><p>While negotiating this acquisition, I kept in mind something one of my mentors shared when buying assets. Assuming youâ€™re not in crazy hot competition for something, it often pays to approach deals in a certain way: â€œ<strong>my price, your terms OR your price, my terms.</strong>â€�&nbsp;</p><p>Letâ€™s say we wanted to buy an app for $1M, and wanted to pay for it over 1-2 years with monthly cash payments. Our lovely seller wants to sell for $1.5M.&nbsp;</p><p>In a scenario like this, weâ€™d put in an offer of $1M cash, up-front (his terms, our price) and see if that gets it done. Alternatively, if the seller was firm on price but didnâ€™t care as much about cash right now, weâ€™d offer $1.5M paid out over 1-2 years in monthly cash payments. His price, our terms.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, we ended up going with the other option for the Notify deal: the price the owner wanted for the company, on our terms.</p><p>Scott, Notifyâ€™s owner, wanted a high (but fair) price, and wanted to have a piece of the upside going forward. We landed on a structure that would reach his goals <em>and</em> allow us to buy the business for literally $0.&nbsp;</p><p>Hereâ€™s how (<em>note: numbers are not actuals</em>):</p><ol><li>We agreed on an overall value of the business: call it $500K.&nbsp;</li><li>We then discussed how much ownership Scott wanted to maintain in the entity going forward. Letâ€™s say we landed at 20%: we then subtracted that ownership from the total purchase price, and had to figure out how to come up with $400K to buy 80% of the business.&nbsp;</li><li>As I said earlier: he chose the price, we chose the terms. Our terms were that weâ€™d buy the business via a series of monthly payments over the next 20 months. So, in our example $400K required purchase amount, weâ€™d pay $20K/mo to buy the business.&nbsp;</li><li>Hereâ€™s the kicker: we structured the deal so that payments would begin 60 days after close.

      <div>
        <p>tldr; reimplement standard library functions in your favorite
language <em>without loops</em>.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>For a few years after college I spent a lot of free time doing
projects in Standard ML and Scheme. As a result I got really
comfortable doing recursion. The two big reasons for this are 1)
neither Standard ML or Scheme have loops and 2) they both have very
small standard libraries. (Ok, they have loops. They're just so
limited as to be useless.)</p>
<p>I ended up building <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/ponyo">a standard
library</a> for Standard ML including
string functions (contains, indexOf, count, replace, etc.), an HTTP
server and client, a hash table, a binary search tree, parts of a
Standard ML parser, and <a href="https://ponyo.org/reference">so on</a>.</p>
<p>All of this without loops.</p>
<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3><p>The good news (if you don't want to learn a new language) is that you
don't have to take up Standard ML or Scheme to get better at
recursion. But you do need to dedicate some time to <em>practicing
recursion</em> to get better at it.</p>
<p>My recommendation would be to pick 10-20 string or array functions out
of your favorite language's standard library and reimplement them
without loops. (Obviously, start simple and just pick one. But
don't stop there.)</p>
<h3 id="some-examples">Some examples</h3><p>Here's an example reimplementation of <code>indexOf</code> in
JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>function indexOf(input, toMatch) {
  function helper(index, offset, test) {
    if (index === input.length) {
      return -1;
    }

    if (toMatch === test) {
      return index;
    }

    if (input[index+offset] !== toMatch[offset] || test.length &gt; toMatch.length) {
      return helper(index+1, 0, "");
    }

    return helper(index, offset+1, test+input[index+offset]);
  }

  return helper(0, 0, "");
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or here's an example immutable reimplementation of <code>insert</code>
in Python:</p>
<pre><code>def insert(arr, index, item):
  def helper(currentIndex, accum):
    if currentIndex == len(arr):
      return accum
    if currentIndex &lt; index:
      return helper(currentIndex+1, accum + [arr[currentIndex]])
    if currentIndex == index:
      return helper(currentIndex+1, accum + [item, arr[currentIndex]])
    return helper(currentIndex+1, accum + [arr[currentIndex]])
  return helper(0, [])
</code></pre>
<p>
  You're going to find an edge case and that's all right. The
  important part at the moment is practicing recursion.
</p><p>For bonus points, avoid all mutation in your implementations and use
only tail recursion.</p>
<p>Happy recursion!</p>

All the participants exercised regularly in the cold, whether it was running outside, cross-country skiing or ski mountaineering.</p>  <p>All participants reported having some type of respiratory symptom&nbsp;after running in the cold (most said they had a cough), and breathing tests revealed that nine out of the 16 showed symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or narrowing of the airways, consistent with levels that would be considered exercise-induced asthma.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938610.1614976337!/fileImage/httpImage/lungs2.gif"></p></div><figcaption>As the winter athlete begins to heavily inhale cold, dry air, the bronchioles can begin to constrict as if they are under threat. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Sködt McNalty/CBC Graphics)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>What happens to lungs in the cold</h2>  <p>A main issue with exercising in the cold, especially in temperatures –15 C and colder, is the lack of moisture in the air.&nbsp;</p>  <p>When dry air hits the lungs, especially when someone is breathing heavily, it can provoke the lungs to react as if they were under threat.&nbsp;The airways essentially constrict to protect themselves.</p>  <p>Kennedy has compared the effects of&nbsp;room temperature dry air against cold dry air, and his findings suggest that dry air that's also cold can provoke even more of a reaction,&nbsp;which may explain why chronic cough is so common among winter athletes, he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some research from around the world is beginning to suggest&nbsp;people who spend years exercising in cold, dry conditions might become more sensitive to lung irritants over time, according to Kennedy, although he cautions more data in this area is still needed.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Over time, if you repeat that irritation or that provocation, the lung just becomes less capable of healing itself,"&nbsp;said Kennedy.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938593.1614976349!/fileImage/httpImage/lungs.gif"></p></div><figcaption>A cross section of a bronchiole shows how muscles constrict to make the airway more narrow. It is the same process that takes place in people experiencing asthma symptoms. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Sködt McNalty/CBC Graphics)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>Ways to protect your lungs</h2>  <p>Gordon Giesbrecht, the director of the Laboratory for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, agrees the cold, dry air can be an issue for anyone who engages in heavy cardiovascular activity on a regular basis in the winter. He likens the experience of lung constriction to trying to take a deep breath through an ever-narrowing straw.</p>  <p>"You can't freeze your lungs," he said. "You're not going to cause any damage although it is possible that continuous long-term training in the cold actually does make you more susceptible to this (bronchoconstriction)."</p>  <p>Both Giesbrecht and Kennedy say a simple face covering, such as a fabric mask, neck warmer or scarf, can go a long way to protecting the lungs from being irritated.</p>  <p>"If you cover your mouth, you're essentially warming the air and humidifying the air in a very productive manner," said Kennedy. "So essentially, your lung has to deal with less cold, dry air."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rideau-canal-skating.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A simple face covering, such as a mask, scarf or neck warmer, can help humidify and warm air before it hits the lungs. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Brian Morris/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>He also suggests that athletes take time to warm up before they exercise and take it easy on very cold days by slowing down their pace.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He hopes his work helps to change the culture of winter sport in Canada so that athletes&nbsp;take steps to prevent&nbsp;symptoms such as chronic cough, lung pain and wheezing.</p>  <p>"One of the things I want to do in the next 10 years is try to prevent some of this acute dysfunction from happening by improving the behaviours of younger skiers or winter sports athletes," Kennedy said.</p>  <p>Later this month, he plans to begin his next study — a survey of cross-country skiers and biathlon athletes&nbsp;asking them to elaborate on any respiratory&nbsp;symptoms they have so researchers have a better sense of the scope of the issue. He plans to expand the study to winter runners and other recreational athletes as well.</p>  <p>For now, Stewart-Jones&nbsp;brushes off the concerns about cold-weather exercise on her breathing. No serious athlete, including herself,&nbsp;would turn down a race because it's –18C, she said. As far as face coverings go, she wears them if her skin is at risk of freezing but she avoids them otherwise — neck warmers, like masks, can make it slightly more difficult to breathe.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I guess it's so normal and common for people to have irritated lungs that it's not something I think about," she said between a couple, short bursts of coughing after competing in Oberstdorf, Germany, at the World Championships in late February.</p>  <p>"For sure it feels like it's probably not great for my lungs long term."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
        
        <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
        
         
      
      <p><em>Note: Since it came up last time, I’m not in any way affiliated with any of the entities discussed in this article</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-web-monetization">What is Web Monetization</h2>
<p><a href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization</a> is a browser API that allows content creators to monetize content, and content consumers to pay for it, anonymously, without ads or any friction, like paywalls and subscriptions.</p>
<p>The basic concept is that a content creator signals they’re accepting payments, and the content consumer, via a browser extension, natively in the browser or by account linking, streams micropayments via the <a href="https://interledger.org/">Interledger</a>, which supports a wide variety of providers and currencies ( real and crypto). The point is, as a consumer you pay for what you consume directly ( instead of indirectly via tracking and ads ) and proportionally.</p>
<p>It’s based on an open <a href="https://webmonetization.org/specification.html">specification</a> which is still a work in progress, but fully functional.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-participate-in-it">Why you should participate in it</h2>
<p>A lot of people don’t like ads - be it because they find them wasteful, too obnoxious, too insistent, too intrusive, too dumb, etc. Even more people dislike tracking ( the art of following user actions across the internet to serve them more “relevant” ads based on their interests ), because that centralises a lot of power and knowledge in a few big companies ( Google, Facebook, etc. ), and allows precise targeting, which has been used for some nasty things. If I may quote the EFF directly:</p>
<p><em>Over the years, the machinery of targeted advertising has frequently been used for <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/payday-lenders-are-finding-ways-around-googles-ad-ban">exploitation</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-advertisers/u-s-charges-facebook-with-racial-discrimination-in-targeted-housing-ads-idUSKCN1R91E8">discrimination</a>, and <a href="https://stoponlinevaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Black-ID-Target-by-Russia-Report-SOVAW.pdf">harm</a>. The ability to target people based on ethnicity, religion, gender, age, or ability allows discriminatory ads for jobs, housing, and credit. Targeting based on credit history - or characteristics systematically associated with it - enables predatory ads for high-interest loans. Targeting based on demographics, location, and political affiliation helps purveyors of politically motivated disinformation and voter suppression.</em></p>
<p>A big part of the aforementioned people, and plenty of others, use ad blockers ( either as browser plugins like AdBlock Plus or Ublock (Origin), or DNS-level like PiHole and AdGuard Home ), which block ads, trackers and various analytics software, which aren’t necessarily the same as trackers - their main purpose is to analyse and aggregate users of the website, by country, language, browser, device type (mobile, PC), how they came upon the website, how much time they spent on what page, etc. compared to trackers' main purpose, which is to analyse per-user (anonymised, but still) interests and behaviour and recommend related ads.</p>
<p>There are proposals by Google to supposedly improve upon the experience of tracking ( in part due to major browsers like Firefox blocking some of the technology enabling such tracking ), but there are <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">major issues with them</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, for a lot of web content creators, ads remain the main way to make money of the content they produce, which could be just to compensate costs, as a reward for the time spent, or even potentially to allow transferring to full time content producing. And for a lot of content consumers, blocking ads removes the only way to “pay”, baring some direct donations scheme.</p>
<p>Ideally, there should be an easy way to directly pay for the content you consume. In some cases you can subscribe and pay a monthly fee, but that could never cover it all - nobody will pay for every small blog, recipe/repair tutorial/gardening tips website/YouTube channel. How much value do they bring to you ? How much would you pay for them? How would you know they’re worth it without using them first, and why would they allow you to use them for free, when most users would be one-shot coming from a search engine? And then there’s non-profit open/crowdsourced institutions like <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> ( which is Web Monetized) whose principles make them incompatible with ads and paywalls/subscriptions and force them to rely on donations.</p>
<p>Enter Web Monetization - with almost no friction, content consumers pay-per-use ( time spent ), automatically, and more or less anonymously. If content creators desire, there can be exclusive features only for “paying” ( participating in Web Monetization ) users, or no ads for them.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the concept is nothing new - the French Minitel ( more info on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel">Wikipedia</a> and a fascinating read by the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/cyberspace/minitel-the-online-world-france-built-before-the-web">IEEE</a>) system, in a sense a predecessor of the Internet, which among other things, contained specifically paying per time spent on pages.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, there is only one Web Monetization provider - <a href="https://coil.com/">Coil.com</a>, but the API is open so in theory anyone can join in and compete with them.</p>
<p>For content consumers, they provide browser extensions ( which are FOSS under the Apache 2.0 licence and available on <a href="https://github.com/coilhq/web-monetization-projects">GitHub</a>) and subscriptions ($5 USD/month), which are spent at the rate of $0.36 USD an hour, providing for roughly 13 hours of content consumption. After $4.50 is spent, the rate is lowered to last until the end of the month. Said subscription also includes some perks, such as ad-free experiences on <a href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/perks/imgur-emerald">Imgur</a> with Emerald and <a href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/perks/cinnamon">Cinnamon</a> ( a subscription-based video content platform).</p>
<p>For content creators, you need an account with a virtual wallet providers that supports ILP ( the Interledger protocol used to make the magic happen, like <a href="https://www.uphold.com/">Uphold</a> and <a href="https://gatehub.net/">Gatehub</a> ) and an HTML meta tag with the address of your wallet ( like so <code>&lt;meta name="monetization" content="$ilp.uphold.com/8Q6r7F3XjXEi"&gt;</code> ) in the code of your website. The latter can be added manually or via any of the existing plugins (there are ones for <a href="https://github.com/sabinebertram/hugo-webmonetization-component">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrmuhammadali/gatsby-plugin-monetization">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sorxrob/svelte-monetization">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/coil-web-monetization/">Wordpress</a>). For some cases where that’s impossible, Coil allow you to connect with YouTube and Twitch directly.</p>
<p>Anonymity and privacy are provided by the way things work - that wallets are randomly generated IDs, Coil transfer the money, the wallet provider knows who the recipient is, the content creators knows how much they’ve received, but nobody knows everything. <a href="https://coil.com/p/sharafian/Doubling-Down-on-Privacy/cD_ZiwT2J">Here’s a post</a> by Coil’s co-founder and CTO Ben Sharafian discussing wallet-side and sender-site (based on <a href="https://privacypass.github.io/">PrivacyPass</a>) privacy techniques they and the wallet providers use to ensure everyone’s privacy is respected.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Of course, that could never replace premium subscription services like the Financial Times, or even direct ones like Substack due to the limited amounts involved, and it isn’t trying to - the point is to help monetise smaller sized websites ( and Youtube/Twitch channels ) <em>or</em> open/crowdsourced/non-profit institutions by providing a decent alternatives to obnoxious ads (which millions of people block anyway ) and paywalls. For instance the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon</a> are web monetized; and so is this and some other small-scale personal blogs. It’s more similar to <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">Buy me a coffee</a>, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a>, only more automated, ubiquitous and with less effort.</p>
<p>However, it’s relatively recent and not very popular yet - according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/WebMotized">WebMotized</a> Twitter bot there’s only 1482 web monetized websites so far. Some more participation is needed, on both sides ( content creators and consumers) to make it a viable alternative to ads and some paywalls. I already did my part</p>
<h2 id="conclusion--summary">Conclusion &amp; Summary</h2>
<p>Are you a content consumer or provider, or both? Don’t like ads and privacy invading tracking? Participate in Web Monetization!</p>

        <p>
        - 6th March 2021
        </p><p>TLDR: I made a super fast (much faster than cp) command line copy program, with a nice progress bar. The implementation dives into some interesting bits of low level async I/O on linux.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/wheybags/wcp">wcp</a> is a file copying experiment I've been working on for the past while. Really, it's an excuse to try out <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">io_uring</a>, a relatively new asynchronous I/O system on linux.</p>
        <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/wcp_demo.gif"></p><p>wcp in action</p>
        <p>If you're unfamiliar with async I/O, it allows you to queue up reads and writes to run in the background, and check back later to see if they're done, without having to wait before you start doing other things (like submitting even more requests). This ain't no fancy pantsy high-level javascript event loopy memory safey framework though. It's a ring buffer in memory shared directly with the kernel, and you're responsible for reading and writing the right things at the right time. Luckily the io_uring authors wrote a <a href="https://github.com/axboe/liburing">handy library</a> that eases some of the pain of this.</p>
        <p>I've been wanting to try my hand at a file copying program for ages - it always confused me that my options for getting a progress bar for a command line copy were so slim. There's been <code>rsync --info=progress2</code> for a while now, but I'll be honest, I have no idea how to read that output.</p>
        <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/rsync.gif"></p><p>What even is this?</p>
        <p>So, when I read about io_uring, I figured it was an excellent opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. I set out to <em>match</em> native cp's performance, and provide a nice progress bar, with some decent ETA (estimated time remaining) calculation. What I did not expect, was to significantly <em>beat</em> cp's speeds. I figured it should be close to, if not at, the limit for file copying performance. And people do always say cp is a bit faster than rsync. In the end, I got something that (disclaimer: works on my machine) is quite a lot faster than cp:</p>
        <h4>20 512MiB files</h4>
        <p>
wcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.97s,&nbsp;&nbsp;2579.59&nbsp;MiB/s<br>
cp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.44s,&nbsp;&nbsp;1213.38&nbsp;MiB/s<br>
rsync&nbsp;17.26s, 593.33&nbsp;&nbsp;MiB/s</p>
        
        <p>These numbers are from a Samsung SSD, I doubt there would be much gain on a spinning metal disk, but I don't have any around anymore to test on.</p>
        <h3>Implementation notes</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>ETA calculation</h4>
        <p>The way the ETA calculation works is pretty interesting IMO. We measure the speed periodically in a separate thread that is devoted to displaying the progress bar. The current speed is estimated by looking at the amount of bytes copied now, and comparing it to the amount of bytes that had been copied 45 seconds ago.</p>
        <p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/estimation.png"></p>
        <p>There is an <a href="https://xkcd.com/612/">xkcd</a> for everything</p>
        <p>This works pretty well, but the problems arise when you have a scenario like the following: You've been copying a bunch of large files, and your current speed estimate is high. Most of your remaining files, however, are small. Small file copies are dominated by the overheads of opening and closing the files, and various bookkeeping around the actual copy. This means, if we use our current speed to estimate how long it will take to copy the remaining files, our estimate will be way too low. The estimate will also swing around wildly depending on what size files we are processing right now.</p>
        <p>I attempted to solve this by conceptually splitting the stack of files to copy into two piles: big and small. A file is "big" if it's over 5KiB, and "small" otherwise. I keep track of the remaining "copies" (a piece of a file) for big and small files separately. Every time a copy chunk completes, I check its size. If it's big, I decrement the "bigFilesRemaining" counter, and similar for small. I also push the big/small status of the copy into a fixed size bitset. This means that at any given moment I can tell: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What my speed is now</li>
            <li>How many of the last N files I copied were big, and how many small</li>
            <li>How many big and small files I have left to copy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>What I do with this information, is that every time I calculate my speed, I add it into a rolling average. But there is not just one rolling average, there are actually eight. If the last 8 copies that completed were all small, the "big" count is zero, so I add my speed into the first rolling average bucket. If four were big, and four were small, it goes in the fourth bucket. Conceptually, the first bucket represents 0% big files, the fourth 50%, and the eighth 100% big. I can then look at the ratio of big/small in the remaining files left to copy, and use that to decide which bucket represents the best estimate of the speed for my total set of remaining files.</p>

        <p>This approach seems to work out pretty well. In the graph above, the error in the ETA (the difference between the ETA we predicted at that point, vs the actual finishing time) drops to about 20 seconds after about 30 seconds have elapsed.</p>
        <h4>asynciness</h4>
        <p>There are a few parts to a file copying program - we need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Iterate the source folder to gather a list of files to copy</li>
            <li>Create the destination folders</li>
            <li>Open the source and destination files</li>
            <li>Copy the data from source to destination</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Of these, only the data copying part is currently done asynchronously. The reason for this is twofold: one, that's the part that takes the most time (usually), and two, io_uring doesn't currently support directory operations (enumerate files in directory and make directory). I actually did do some experimenting with adding <code>IORING_OP_GETDENTS</code> and <code>IORING_OP_MKDIRAT</code> opcodes to io_uring, and made a branch of wcp that uses them, but I haven't tried submitting to the upstream kernel (at least not yet, I might do eventually). Also, I didn't see a massive performance gain. Another point is that trying to submit a patch to the kernel is pretty intimidating :v</p>

  <p>As I sat at the end of a long conference table in the Spring of 2016, I stared out the window taking in the Miami skyline. I had just wrapped up my pitch to a local fund hoping to secure $250,000 for my startup at the time and was now listening to them pass. As my attention waned, ready to move on to the next pitch of the day, one of the partners leaned in close to me. With his hand on my shoulder and a smile on his face: He said, “You should raise a friend and family round! Then you can come back in six months, and we’ll revisit this idea of yours.”</p>

<p>I was perplexed by the sincerity of the suggestion. I lived in North Miami, paying $900 a month for rent, and my friends and family live paycheck-to-paycheck. I would have been surprised if my immediate family’s total savings at the time surpassed $5,000, let alone anything close to what I was raising. Then I remembered, this person lives in a completely different world. For him, the idea that the person pitching him grew up in poverty is such a foreign concept that to fit me into his mental model, he assumes my family has wealth. After all, who is insane enough to do a startup with no safety net?</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, as millionaires and billionaires alike have lambasted Senator Warren’s proposal of a “wealth tax,” I am reminded again of that separate world. For many Black people who have found success, the idea of “personal wealth” doesn’t exist because to have wealth is to share it. Their money isn’t just theirs; it’s their mom’s rent, their sisters used car, food on the table of a struggling family member, Christmas gifts under the tree. For every dollar earned, you don’t value it based on what it can get you, but how far it can go for others. That is why it should come as no surprise that so few Black people have successfully built generational wealth: we’re always actively trying to keep the current generation alive.</p>

<p>Even still, despite knowing the tax of finding success, of being one of the first people to “make it” in their family, each day, Black people across America put their hearts and souls into their work. They overcome socioeconomic inequality issues, racism, and sexism to move mountains to pursue their dreams because personal success isn’t solely measured by the size of dollars earned – which guarantees what they are working on will be that much more valuable.</p>

<p>If Paul Graham believes a wealth tax will cause people <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1366445681251123214">not to build startups</a>, he should invest more in Black founders. A wealth tax isn’t going to stop us from building our visions. We already pay the Black tax to do it.</p>

      <h2>It's raymarching march!</h2>
      <time datetime="2021-03-06T00:00:00+01:00">06 March 2021</time>
      <p>In preparation for my computer graphics exam next week, I decided to take an excursion to the low-level side of things:
        ray marching ASCII graphics of rotating spheres!</p>
      <h2 id="multiple-ways-to-create-an-image">Multiple ways to create an image</h2>
      <p>Generally, there are two different ways to generate an image with a computer:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Object-order rendering (rasterization)</li>
        <li>Image-order rendering (ray tracing, ray marching)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Object-order rendering is the technique commonly used for both games and visualizations alike: APIs like OpenGL allow
        you to draw objects made up from primitives like triangles piece by piece. The primitives are projected into 2D,
        depth-tests are made to ensure objects behind another one are invisible and finally, they are coloured in pixel by
        pixel. This way, you “rasterize” a 3D-object onto your screen.</p>
      <p>Image-order rendering takes a different approach, however: you do not fill the screen object after object, but pixel
        after pixel. So instead of looking at a triangle and figuring out where to draw it on the screen, you take a single
        pixel of the screen and figure out what colour it might be. As light rays emitted by a light source hit an object, some
        of them are reflected into the eye or camera of the observer. Since lots of light rays are emitted but never actually
        hit the camera, it is much more efficient to trace them backwards: send out “rays” from the camera, determine where they
        hit an object and then see if the path to the light source is occluded. This technique can allow for much more realistic
        graphics, seen with modern technology like the NVIDIA RTX GPUs that employ a mixture of object-order and image-order
        rendering.</p>
      <p>While these techniques <em>can</em> be used to produce high-quality images, in this article we will try to render an image made
        up of ASCII characters into the terminal. It can be easily adapted to output image files, though.</p>
      <h2 id="raymarching-introduction">Raymarching introduction</h2>
      <p>In this article, we will focus on image-order rendering, and ray marching in particular. Where ray tracing consists of a
        scene made up of primitives whose intersections with the ray are calculated using “fixed” algorithms, ray marching
        represents the scene implicitly by a <em>surface distance function</em>. It maps a point in space to a lower limit of the
        distance to the nearest object in the scene – similar to radar, it tells us how much further we can go without
        hitting anything.</p>

</pre><p>This is an early attempt at microarchitecture documentation for the CPU in the Apple M1, inspired by and building on the amazing work of <a href="https://uops.info/">Andreas Abel</a>,
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16226/apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive/2">Andrei Frumusanu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Veedrac/microarchitecturometer">@Veedrac</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/robsize">Travis Downs</a>, <a href="http://blog.stuffedcow.net/2013/05/measuring-rob-capacity/">Henry Wong</a>
and <a href="https://agner.org/optimize/">Agner Fog</a>. This documentation is my best effort, but it is based on black-box reverse engineering, and there are definitely mistakes. No warranty of any kind (and not just as a legal technicality). To make it easier to verify the information and/or identify such errors, entries in the instruction tables link to the experiments and results (~35k tables of counter values).</p>


<p>Firestorm is the high-performance microarchitecture used by the four P-cores in the M1.</p>

<h2>Firestorm Units (ports)</h2>

<p>These are refered to as "units", to try to avoid confusion if Apple releases official documentation, as they
probably refer to them as "ports" or "pipes", and order them differently. (If this just causes more confusion,
I apologise.)</p>

<pre>Integer units:

  1:  alu + flags + branch + adr + msr/mrs nzcv + mrs
  2:  alu + flags + branch + adr + msr/mrs nzcv + ptrauth
  3:  alu + flags + mov-from-simd/fp?
  4:  alu + mov-from-simd/fp?
  5:  alu + mul + div
  6:  alu + mul + madd + crc + bfm/extr

Load and store units (up to 128-bit loads and stores, including address generation with shifts up to LSL #3):

  7:  store + amx
  8:  load/store + amx
  9:  load
  10: load

FP/SIMD units:

  11: fp/simd
  12: fp/simd
  13: fp/simd + fcsel + to-gpr
  14: fp/simd + fcsel + to-gpr + fcmp/e + fdiv + frecpe + frsqrte + fjcvtzs + ursqrte + urecpe + sha
</pre>


<h2>Instruction Fusion</h2>

<p>Certain instructions are able to issue as one uop if they appear consecutively in the instruction stream.</p>

<ul>
<li>adds/subs/ands/cmp/tst + b.cc (complete fusion when fused instructions read no more than 4 registers per 6 instructions)</li>
<li>aese + aesmc (always fused if operands match pattern "A, B ; A, A")</li>
<li>aesd + aesimc (always fused if operands match pattern "A, B ; A, A")</li>
<li>pmull + eor (usually fused if operands match pattern "A, B, C ; A, A, D" or "A, B, C ; A, D, A")</li>
<li>amx + amx (excluding loads and stores - probably fuses to something like a STP)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Elimination</h2>

<p>Certain instructions do not need to issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>mov x0, 0 (handled by renaming)</li>
<li>mov x0, x1 (usually handled by renaming)</li>
<li>movi v0.16b, #0 (handled by renaming)</li>
<li>mov v0.16b, v1.16b (usually handled by renaming)</li>
<li>mov imm/movz/movn (handled by renamer at a max of 2 per 8 instructions, includes all tested "mov")</li>
<li>nop (never issues)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Complex Latencies</h2>

<p>Several instructions have latencies that aren't adequately described in the instruction tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>MADD's output can be passed to its third operand (the addend) with 1c latency, but if it's chained with other instructions it has 3c latency.</li>
<li>Loads may be passed to the base address of other loads with 3c latency (which is nice for linked lists), but chaining with ALU operations gives a latency of 4c. (Although the second destination register in an LDP always has 4c latency.)</li>
<li>Integer to SIMD/FP roundtrip latency can be as low as 7c (e.g. when chaining flags operations).</li>
<li>Not yet in the table: pointer authentication uops have seven cycle latency, one cycle throughput. They are one uop (except for memory operations).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other limits</h2>

<p>Firestorm can retire eight instructions per cycle, but can issue more uops (using implicit shifts or extends on ALU operations, as thus far other uops retire separately).</p>

<ul>
<li>Retires per cycle: 8</li>
<li>ROB (in-flight renames): ~623</li>
<li>Integer physical register file size: ~380</li>
<li>FP/SIMD physical register file size: ~434</li>
<li>Fetch window tracking slots (in-flight I-cache lines or branches): ~144</li>
<li>Load buffers: ~129</li>
<li>Store buffers: ~108</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers mostly come from my <a href="https://gist.github.com/dougallj/5bafb113492047c865c0c8cfbc930155">M1 buffer size measuring tool</a>.
The M1 seems to use something other than an entirely conventional reorder buffer, which
complicates measurements a bit. So these may or may not be accurate.
(This paragraph previously said "it seems to use something along the lines of a validation buffer".
I think the VB hypothesis has since been disproven. Various attempts to measure ROB size
have yielded values 623, 853, and 2295 (see the previous link). My uninformed hypothesis
is that this may imply a kind of distributed reorder buffer, where only structures that
need to know about a given operation track them, and/or some kind of out-of-order retirement.)
</p>


<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>
As instructions are executed, they are mapped to operations inside the processor.
This work describes two kinds, "operations that retire" (which I call "retires",
but should maybe be called "retirement slots"), and "operations that issue" (uops).
Operations that issue are limited by how many ports are available that can execute
that operation in a given cycle. Retirement slots are limited to eight per cycle,
which I have called the "retires per cycle" limit, but likely corresponds to a
frontend "decode width", rather than a limit related to retirement itself
(which I suspect could be either out-of-order, or much wider). All instructions
have at least one retire, but some instructions have more uops than retires
(e.g. ADD (shift)), and others have fewer (e.g. NOP, LDP).
</p>


<p>
These two types of operations can be measured, using the retire counter (counter 01,
undocumented, shown in the <strong>Retire</strong> column in the tables), and the
issue counter (counter 52, documented). The following three undocumented counters
(53, 54, and 55) count the same kind of uops as the issue counter, but at a different
point in the pipeline. These correspond to the <strong>Int</strong>, <strong>Mem</strong>
and <strong>FP</strong> columns in the tables, and count uops that issues to units of
the given type.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the <strong>Units</strong> column is based on finding conflicts when measuring
throughput - if two uops block each other, we can tell they both use the same unit.
(Unfortunately these experiments are not yet automated nor included in the documentation,
so there may be some mistakes.)

March 7, 2021 | https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">← Back to Kevin's homepage</a><span>Published: 2021 March 7</span></p><p>I’ve spent the last year <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>, which has included writing firmware for a variety custom circuit boards.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this firmware in Rust, but despite years of experience with that language I still struggled quite a bit.
I eventually got my keyboards working, but it took an embarrassingly long time and wasn’t <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>After repeated suggestions from my much more Rust-and-computing-experienced friend <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/">Jamie Brandon</a>, I rewrote the firmware in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, which turned out swimmingly.</p>

<p>I found this quite surprising, given that I’d never seen Zig before and it’s a pre-1.0 language written by a <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_kelley">fellow PDX hipster</a> with basically just a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.7.1/">single page of documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The experience went so well, in fact, that I now feel just as likely to turn to Zig (a language I’ve used for a dozen hours) as to Rust (which I’ve used for at least a thousand hours).</p>

<p>This, of course, reflects as much about me and my interests as it does about either of these languages.
So I’ll have to explain what I want from a systems programming language in the first place.</p>

<p>Also, to explain why I struggled with Rust I’ll have to show a lot of complex code that I’m obviously unhappy about.
My intent here is not to gripe about Rust, but to establish my (lack of) credibility: It’s so you can judge for yourself whether I’m using Rust’s features in a reasonable way or if I’ve totally lost the plot.</p>

<p>Finally, while it risks falling into the dreadfully boring “language X is better than Y” blog trope, I feel that it’d be more helpful to some readers if I explicitly compare Rust and Zig, rather than write a wholly positive “Zig’s great!” article.
(After all, I’d steadily ignored six months of Jamie gushing about Zig because, “that’s great buddy, but I already know Rust and I just want to get my keyboard done, okay?”)</p>

<h2>What I want from a systems language</h2>

<p>I was educated as a physicist and learned programming so I could make data visualizations.
My first languages were PostScript and Ruby (dynamic, interpreted languages) and I later moved to JavaScript so I could draw on the web.
That led me to Clojure (using ClojureScript to draw on the web), where I’ve spent much of my career.</p>

<p>In 2017 I decided to learn a systems language.
Partly this was intellectual curiosity — I wanted to become more familiar with concepts like the stack, heap, pointers, and static types which had remained mucky to me as a web developer.
But mostly it was because I wanted the capabilities that systems languages promised:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To write code that was <em>fast</em>; that could take advantage of how computers actually worked and run as fast as the hardware allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>To write applications that could run in minimal environments like microcontrollers or web assembly where it just isn’t feasible (in time or space) to carry along a garbage collector, language runtime, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My interest was not (and still isn’t) in operating systems, programming language design, or safety (with respect to memory, formal verfiability, modeling as types, etc.).</p>

<p>I just wanted to blink the litle squares on the screen on and off very quickly.</p>

<p>Based on its growing popularity in the open source community and tons of beginners-to-systems-programming documentation, I picked up Rust around version 1.18.</p>

<p>Since then, Rust has undoubtedly helped me achieve those capabilities I was after: I was able to compile it to WASM for a <a href="https://github.com/lynaghk/subform-layout">layout engine</a>, build and sell a <a href="https://keminglabs.com/finda">fast desktop search app</a> (Rust <a href="https://keminglabs.com/blog/building-a-fast-electron-app-with-rust/">shoved into Electron</a>), and compile Rust to an stm32g4 microcontroller to drive a <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_02_robot_update/">track saw robot</a> (I even <a href="https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs/pull/335">found a typo</a> in the register definitions; the full “hard-mode” embedded debugging experience!).</p>

<p>Despite all this, I still don’t feel <em>comfortable</em> with Rust.
It feels fractally complex — seemingly every time I use Rust on a new project, I run into some issue that forces me to confront a new corner of the language/ecosystem.
Developing my keyboard firmware was no exception: I ran into two problems, and each required learning a completely new language feature.</p>

<p>These problems aren’t really specific to embedded, but they’re representative of the sorts of challenges I’ve run into using Rust over the past three years.</p>

<p>If you want the gory embedded details or understand why I’m writing my own firmware using newfangled languages at all, see my notes on <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>.</p>

<h2>Conditional compilation</h2>

<p>The first challenge I ran into with Rust was getting my firmware to run on hardware varying from 4-button dev-kit PCBs to the left/right halves of a wireless split to a single <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/typical_keyboards.jpg" alt="Various keyboard hardware"></p>

<p>Varying the features of firmware at compile-time is known as “conditional compilation”.
(It needs to be done at compile-time rather than run-time because microcontrollers have limited program space, roughly 10–100kB in my case.)</p>

<p>Rust’s solution to this problem is “features”, which are defined in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>cortex-m</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>nrf52840-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>nrf52833-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>arraydeque</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.4"</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>heapless</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.5"</span>

<span>[features]</span>
<span>keytron</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>keytron-dk</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>splitapple</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840"]</span>
<span>splitapple-left</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>
<span>splitapple-right</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>

<span># specify a default here so that rust-analyzer can build the project; when building use --no-default-features to turn this off</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>["keytron"]</span>

<span>nrf52840</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840-hal"]</span>
<span>nrf52833</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833-hal"]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For example, the <code>keytron</code> feature is enabled for a specific keyboard hardware design.
That hardware depends on the <code>nrf52833</code> feature (representing a kind of a microcontroller), which depends on the <code>nrf52833-hal</code> crate (actual code which maps that microcontroller’s peripheral memory addresses to Rust types).</p>

<p>My Rust code can then use attribute annotations to conditionally enable stuff.
E.g., a namespace can import the microcontroller-specific crate:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52833"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52840"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>or call the appropriate key scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>unsafe</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>hw</span>::<span>Peripherals</span>::<span>steal</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(any(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>, feature = </span><span>"keytron-dk"</span><span>))]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p0</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P1</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>        </span><span>//invert because keys are active low</span>
<span>        </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P0</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P1</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p1</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>splitapple</span>::<span>read_keys</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Packet</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Getting this conditional compilation working required learning a lot of stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>the attribute annotation conditional mini-language (the <code>any</code> in <code>#[cfg(any(feature = "keytron", feature = "keytron-dk"))]</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>optional = true</code> that must be added to the device crates in <code>Cargo.toml</code> (even though the source is already conditionally requiring them!)</li>
<li>how to enable features when building a static binary (<code>cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "keytron"</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have many unresolved questions, too!</p>

<p>At some point I gave up trying to pass device peripherals as function arguments because I couldn’t figure out how to add conditional attributes to types — the “obvious” thing doesn’t work:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>(</span><span>port</span>: <span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P1</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P0</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>There’s a neat embedded framework, <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.4/book/en/preface.html">RTIC</a>, whose main entry point is an <code>app</code> annotation that takes the device crate as an, uh, argument:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[app(device = nrf52833)]</span><span></span>
<span>const</span><span> </span><span>APP</span>: <span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>//your code here...</span>
<span>};</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>How does one conditionally vary this argument at compile-time?
I have no idea.</p>

<h2>Types and macros</h2>

<p>Rust also proved challenging even within a single hardware configuration.</p>

<p>Consider scanning a keyboard matrix: If we don’t have enough microcontroller pins to connect each keyboard switch directly to a pin, we can arrange the switches with diodes (one-way valves) into a matrix:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/key_matrix.png" alt="circuit schematic of key matrix"></p>

<p>We then set a single column high and read out the the rows to find state of the switches on that column.</p>

<p>In this example, if we set pin 1.10 high (col0) and then read pin 0.13 (row1) as high, we know that switch K8 is pressed.</p>

<p>Pretty simple in theory, but complex in Rust because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Device crates expose hardware peripherals as distinct types</li>
<li>One does not simply compute with distinct types in Rust</li>
</ol>

<p>Say I need to initialize all the columns as output pins.</p>

<p>Doing this for a single pin, say peripheral port P0’s pin 10, is simple enough:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>10</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>});</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>But my column pins are spread across two ports, so what I <em>want</em> to write:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>pin</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>[(</span><span>P0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>P1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>..</span><span>.]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>port</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>pin</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>});</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>isn’t going to fly because now the tuples have different types — <code>(P0, usize)</code> and <code>(P1, usize)</code> — and so they can’t hang together in the same collection.</p>

<p>Here’s the solution I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>PinIdx</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>type</span> <span>Port</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>const</span><span> </span><span>COL_PINS</span>: <span>[(</span><span>Port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PinIdx</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span></span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">← Back to Kevin's homepage</a><span>Published: 2021 March 7</span></p><p>The electronics design and fabrication technologies available to motivated individuals today is incredible.
Compared to even just 6 years ago when I <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/phonetron/">made a cell phone</a>, we amateurs now have access to powerful CAD/CAM, low-cost/qty PCB assembly, sorta-usable free EDA software, powerful new embedded languages, and a huge corpus of tacit knowledge on YouTube.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last year exploring this frontier by building wireless mechanical keyboards.
I’ve designed a dozen PCBs, written bare-metal microcontroller firmware in three languages, and commissioned or fabricated myself a ton of parts from aluminum, acrylic, Corian, resin, and fabric:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/keyboards.jpg" alt="A bunch of keyboards"></p>

<p>This page isn’t a tutorial or comprehensive reference on any particular technical topic (though I’ll link to my favorites below).
Rather, it’s a rough diary and reflection on the process.
My hope is that:</p>

<ol>
<li>it gives you a flavor of the overall experience and demystifies the work between “idea” and “functioning prototype”</li>
<li>you’ll discover at least one weird trick that you can apply to your own projects</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have ideas, questions, or think I can help with your creative explorations, feel free to <a href="mailto:kevin@keminglabs.com">send me an email</a>.</p>

<h2>Motivation: Why keyboards?</h2>

<p>I’ll start with a little secret: I don’t care much about keyboards.
Most of my typing is on an 11" Macbook Air from 2013, though my fingers sometimes grace client-provided hardware like Dell laptops, IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads, and newer Macs with those butterfly keyboards that Twitter/HN people got real mad about.
They’re all fine, really.</p>

<p>I first learned of the custom keyboard scene when I convinced a friend to <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/">sell his keyboards for $1,668</a>, but personally never developed any burning desire to acquire (or bring into existence) a keyboard the way my friend and his fans did.</p>

<p>Rather, keyboards appeal to me as a playground of design constraints and technical challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Electrically, keyboards can be wired (drawing power and communicating over USB) or wireless, the latter raising issues of power (selecting batteries, charging and load-sharing circuitry, etc.) and communication (to host devices and between halves of a split keyboard).</p></li>
<li><p>Physically, keyboards have functional size constraints (relating to one’s fingers) but are not subject to serious mechanical loads, so a huge variety of materials and designs can be explored for aesthetic qualities (visual look, key feel, typing sound, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Functionally, keyboard logic can range from simple “press key for character” behavior all the way to elaborate schemes involving multiple layers, tapping keys, special sequences, and even acting as a computer mouse.
(See the open source <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides">QMK firmware</a> for the more popular tricks.)
In addition to its behavior as an input device, a keyboard might also need to handle activities like Bluetooth pairing, signaling battery status, and blinking lights in amusing ways.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While these three domains — electronics, physical design/fabrication, and firmware — are all interesting to me on their own, they become even more fascinating combined together.</p>

<p>It’s immensely satisfying, for example, to find optimizations and novel product functionality by synthesizing knowledge across these disciplines:</p>

<ul>
<li>restricting the hardware to a subset of GPIO pins simplifies the firmware, allowing it to run faster and consume less battery</li>
<li>PCBs can function load-bearing mechanical parts</li>
<li>I’d never heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">NFC</a>, but after discovering it in my microcontroller’s datasheet I was inspired to develop a “type on your phone by tapping it to the keyboard” quick-switching feature</li>
</ul>

<p>As a problem space, keyboards have a “low floor and high ceiling”.</p>

<p>Finally, as a long-time web developer I’m attracted to the minimalism of embedded hardware products.
Application code running in a web browser is subject to the whims of operating system schedulers, JavaScript JITs, and millions of lines of “system” code running underneath.
Working in such a complex environment, it’s easy to develop a learned helplessness around performance, understandability, and even determinism.</p>

<p>While surely some of this is “grass-is-greener” thinking — yes, I’m aware of cosmic rays, bad solder joints, and thermal variation — I’ve found it an enjoyable change of pace to switch from StackOverflow comments and ever-changing dependencies to bare-metal code (mostly mine) running on physical hardware (also mine) that I can power-cycle instantly, documented by 1000-page datasheets which discuss worst-case timing guarantees in microseconds.</p>

<h2>Retrospective overview + timeline</h2>

<p>My <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_04_keyboards_rethinking_desktops/">original product concept</a> was a “split ergonomic travel keyboard”, but I ended up spending far more time on technical pursuits and process development than I did getting a tightly-scoped product out the door.
However, I managed to complete three functional prototypes:</p>

<h3>v1</h3>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/v1.jpg" alt="V1 keyboard"></p>

<p>My initial focus was on maximally compact mechanical keyboard.
I chose a 5x5 grid (no real reason) of Kailh’s low-profile “Choc” switches and selected components that would fit between the stems of the switches on the PCB backside.</p>

<p>This keyboard involved a lot of personal firsts: Using KiCAD, designing an nRF52-based board and firmware, designing a battery protection and charging circuit (my first use of a P-type MOSFET), drawing footprints for a mid-mount USB connector, etc.</p>

<p>In hindsight I’m amazed it all actually worked on the first revision, and I’m still tickled that I sourced custom, adorable-sized 2 x 13 x 80 mm lithium polymer cells ($200 for 50pcs from <a href="https://www.fentcell.com/">Battsys</a>).</p>

<p>This v1 PCB worked great as a platform on which to develop firmware and refine my understanding of the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and USB protocols  (as exposed via Nordic Semiconductor’s SDK — I’m not yet ambitious enough to bit-bang the radio antenna myself).</p>

<h3>The “Split Apple”</h3>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/split_apple.jpg" alt="Split Apple keyboard"></p>

<p>As soon I paired with a computer and actually tried using the v1 split keyboard , I realized I couldn’t be bothered to re-learn how to type on 50 ortholinear keys.
So, for the next iteration, I decided to just split of Apple’s keyboard layout.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all the necessary keycap sizes were available for Choc switches, so I had to make this one with taller Cherry MX switches.
Rather than wait ~5 weeks for PCBWay assembly, I designed with parts from JLCPCB’s catalog (~1 week turnaround) and soldered myself the nRF52840 dongle.</p>

<p>Because JLCPCB doesn’t assemble USB connectors, the Split Apple also pushed me to implement wireless charging hardware and over-the-air firmware updates (with associated bootloader stack).</p>

<p>By this point I’d found an sign shop here in Taipei that was happy to same-day laser cut acrylic from PDF drawings, and I relied on them extensively for cheap and fast (about $5 per 150mm laser-cut acrylic part) material mock-ups while prototyping the keyboard’s “PCB + acrylic + acrylic” stack-up construction (an idea I stole from this <a href="https://github.com/PancakeLegend/Keyboards/wiki/MiT-Ortholinear:-Assembly-Guide">PancakeLegend keyboard</a>).</p>

<p>Because of the complexity of its layout (not just a 5x5 grid) and stacked-layer construction, the Split Apple forced me to develop a programmatic process to carry designs from <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/">keyboard-layout-editor.com</a> (of course that’s a thing) to my PCB and mechanical CAD software.
This process came in quite handy for all subsequent work.</p>

<h3>The Atreus</h3>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/atreus.jpg" alt="Atreus keyboard"></p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/bamboo_atreus.jpg" alt="Atreus keyboard"></p>

<p>In November I got access to a desktop CNC mill and immediately started exploring designs using Corian, an artificial stone-like material typically found in fancy kitchen countertops.
I wanted to explore fabricating a small production run (~50 keyboards?) myself, so I machined <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Phil Hagelberg’s Atreus</a> design as a prototype design, for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The keyless area in the middle highlights the Corian material and (internally) provides room for standard-sized lithium polymer batteries (a fallback I wanted in case shipping my custom lil’ ones proved too difficult).</li>
<li>A single-piece keyboard is half the assembly/QA work of a two-piece keyboard.</li>
<li>The Atreus design seemed as good as any other on which to ramp up machining capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The production framing encouraged me to optimize my design for manufacture (minimize the number of setups and endmills), develop fixtures, and really dial in the feeds &amp; speeds to maximize the material removal rate.</p>

<p>To keep the Atreus from slipping around a desk, I also investigated several silicone and polyurethane materials and mold design techniques.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>

<ul>
<li>2020 March: Rust “hello world” LED blinking on nRF52 dongle</li>
<li>April: BLE and USB stack running on nRF52 dongle</li>
<li>May: Design and order first custom PCB (v1)</li>
<li>June: While waiting for v1, make <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/touchpad/">touchpad</a> as an excuse to try JLCPCB’s assembly service</li>
<li>July: Reorganize firmware architecture (have Nordic’s Makefile link to Rust rather than Rust compile Nordic’s code)</li>
<li>August: BLE for split board</li>
<li>Sept: Try to use v1 keyboard, implement layers, keymaps, etc.</li>
<li>Oct: Design full-sized Apple-layout split keyboard and matrix-scanning firmware</li>
<li>Nov: Start pushing on industrial design: laser cut acrylic and metal prototypes, get access to a CNC machine</li>
<li>Dec: Optimize machining and workholding for Corian designs, rewrite firmware in Zig </li>
<li>2021 Jan: Machine Atreus and design its PCB, consider production run, product photography</li>
<li>Feb: Write this retrospective</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/MechanicalKeyboards</a> subreddit loves anodized aluminum.
Yes, amazing material: lightweight, strong, corrosion resistant, etc., etc.
But also sorta boring — I mean, we can already buy those keyboards at the Apple store!</p>

<p>I’m much more interested in materials like leather, cork, Corian, and fabric.</p>

<p>Finding such materials and related tooling was difficult in the first few months after I moved Taiwan (<a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_11_online_retail/">I miss McMaster-Carr</a>), but eventually I managed with a lot of legwork and Google Translate-mediated conversations.</p>

<p>I hoped leather might serve as a non-slip “bottom” that could be stitched around or glued to the v1 PCBs:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/leather_base.jpg" alt="leather bottom"></p>

<p>however the thick, already stiff leather became brittle after laser cutting (also, the smell!) and wasn’t actually very grippy (I suspect the v1 PCB is simply …</p></div></div>

   <p id="post-excerpt">
    It seems to be widely accepted that creating a powerful, useful Emacs setup "by hand" is just too much trouble, and you should choose a "distro" like Doom Emacs. But is it really all so bad? If you go the route of "hand-made", will you suffer through endless nights of fixing your setup? The answer is: probably not, but read on for more details! <a href="#footnote-1"><sup id="footnote-ref-1">1</sup></a>
   </p>
   
   <h3 id="why-custom-">
    <a href="#why-custom-">→ </a>Why Custom?
   </h3>
   <p>
    I've got a lot of respect for the various Emacs "distros" out there, but my inclination for DIY as well as for understanding my tools keeps me from going that route. I'd rather spend some time reading and researching than running a prefab setup that's effectively a mystery to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the end of the day I do spend time on my configuration, but it's hardly the part-time job folks make it out to be. And throughout the years, I've learned a substantial amount about how Emacs actually works.
   </p>
   <p>
    Prefab setups are usually nice until you hit some usability wall, or find a leak in the abstraction. Sometimes, you end up putting as much effort into learning your abstraction as you would have put into just learning the thing you tried to abstract. This is why I'm fine with getting my hands dirty with Emacs.
   </p>
   <h3 id="desired-features">
    <a href="#desired-features">→ </a>Desired Features
   </h3>
   <p>
    Before getting into the details of customizing Emacs, it's good to lay out some goals. This will help keep the project focused and prevent you from bloating your setup with things you don't really need. For me, the list looks something like this:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Automated, idempotent setup that can be repeated easily
    </li>
    <li>
     Declaratively install packages
    </li>
    <li>
     LSP support for languages that have a supporting server, powerful autocompletion for those that don't
    </li>
    <li>
     Quality-of-life packages and modes
    </li>
    <li>
     A wealth of custom keybindings to make life better
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    I personally don't need a full-on project management system, or deep IDE-like integration, but indeed all of that is available if you'd want it. Anyways, with these goals in mind, let's begin to discuss implementation.
   </p>
   <h4 id="automatic--idempotent-setup">
    <a href="#automatic--idempotent-setup">→ </a>Automatic, Idempotent Setup
   </h4>
   <p>
    I want to be able to erase my entire setup, clone it down from a git repo, run Emacs, and be back to where I was before I nuked it all (assuming I've got no local, uncommitted changes). Additionally: I want to have a lockfile-like setup for freezing package versions.
   </p>
   <h5 id="straight-el">
    <a href="#straight-el">→ </a>straight.el
   </h5>
   <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el">straight.el</a> package manager is extremely powerful and allows for extreme reproducibility. It does so via:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Installing packages via git clone versus a tarball or some other archive <a href="#footnote-2"><sup id="footnote-ref-2">2</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Easy integration of customized packages into your own setup, if desired <a href="#footnote-3"><sup id="footnote-ref-3">3</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A lockfile for controlling versions of each package <a href="#footnote-4"><sup id="footnote-ref-4">4</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Integration with <code>use-package</code> (more on that <a href="">later</a>) <a href="#footnote-5"><sup id="footnote-ref-5">5</sup></a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The straight.el bootstrap process allows for a totally self-installing setup. For example, with my configuration you just clone my repo to <code>~/.emacs.d</code> and run Emacs; straight.el bootstraps itself and handles installing everything that I need.
   </p>
   <p>
    Check out the exquisite straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for details about how to get setup. It can do far more than what I've described here, so prepare for a deep dive. <a href="#footnote-6"><sup id="footnote-ref-6">6</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h4 id="declarative-package-installation">
    <a href="#declarative-package-installation">→ </a>Declarative Package Installation
   </h4>
   <p>
    As described above and in the project README, straight.el brings a nice element of reproducibility and control over packages and versions, but to take it even further I handle all package installations and their related config with <a href="https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/">use-package</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Integrating use-package with straight.el does require some configuration; again: see the straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for specifics. I strongly advise giving the project README a good look, it is high-quality documentation. <a href="#footnote-7"><sup id="footnote-ref-7">7</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--installing">
    <a href="#use-package--installing">→ </a>use-package: Installing
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package is extremely powerful and also very simple to use. The straight.el integration is done well too; consider this example for setting up OCaml support:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> tuareg <span>:</span>defer t <span>:</span>straight t<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    The use-package syntax is simple and explicit, but what's happening here?
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     I'm installing the <code>tuareg-mode</code> package <a href="#footnote-8"><sup id="footnote-ref-8">8</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling use-package to not load this package until it's needed
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling straight.el to handle the installation
    </li>
    <li>
     By default, straight.el will try to find the package on Github
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Of course that's a very simple example; the use-package readme describes all the various features you can use to tune your setup.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--configuring">
    <a href="#use-package--configuring">→ </a>use-package: Configuring
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package allows configuring packages before and after they are loaded via the <code>:init</code> and <code>:config</code> keyword arguments, respectively.
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> flycheck-status-emoji
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>config
  <span>(</span><span>flycheck-status-emoji-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>

<pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> marginalia
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>init
  <span>(</span><span>marginalia-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <h5 id="use-package--key-binds">
    <a href="#use-package--key-binds">→ </a>use-package: Key Binds
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package also allows for configuring key binds on package load:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> windmove
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>bind
  <span>(</span><span>"M-e"</span> . windmove-left<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-u"</span> . windmove-right<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-k"</span> . windmove-up<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-j"</span> . windmove-down<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    All keybinds then live in your configuration, nicely inside the package declarations themselves.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--hooks">
    <a href="#use-package--hooks">→ </a>use-package: Hooks
   </h5>
   <p>
    The last feature I'm going to discuss is use-package's syntax for hooks:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> html-mode
  <span>:</span>no-require t
  <span>:</span>hook <span>(</span><span>web-mode</span> . skewer-html-mode<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    This should be starting to feel familiar, and again it's nice to have hooks defined with the related packages in an idiomatic way.
   </p>
   <h4 id="language-server">
    <a href="#language-server">→ </a>Language Server
   </h4>
   <p>
    But enough about the awesomeness of straight.el and use-package! One of the main things I wanted when I moved to Emacs was a powerful system for auto-completing code. Emacs has several ways to achieve this, but what I've come to use for almost every mode is <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/">lsp-mode</a> for integrating <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a> capabilities into Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm using lsp-mode with almost all of the languages I work with regularly, except Lua. At least for now and for me, the current LSP experience with Lua wasn't as good as using company-mode. I'll definitely revisit that in the future though.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's isnt much else to say that isn't better said on the project documentation: but you can also refer to <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~hristoast/dot-emacs/tree/2bb9a7dd5ca8cb281c4f8a9a8bea0508464b5c63/item/lib/h-lsp.el">my configuration</a> for usage examples if desired.
   </p>
   <h4 id="quality-of-life">
    <a href="#quality-of-life">→ </a>Quality Of Life
   </h4>
   <p>
    Aside from that, there are a number of other things I've tuned to make my Emacs experience more to my liking:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the editing area <a href="#footnote-9"><sup id="footnote-ref-9">9</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the mode line <a href="#footnote-10"><sup id="footnote-ref-10">10</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dashboard or "startup page" <a href="#footnote-11"><sup id="footnote-ref-11">11</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Emoji icons for Flycheck status <a href="#footnote-12"><sup id="footnote-ref-12">12</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A handful of helper functions
    </li>
    <li>
     ws-butler, to clean up whitespace in edited files <a href="#footnote-13"><sup id="footnote-ref-13">13</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     "TODO" keyword highlighting <a href="#footnote-14"><sup id="footnote-ref-14">14</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Rainbow parenthesis <a href="#footnote-15"><sup id="footnote-ref-15">15</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Yasnippet for inserting various snippets <a href="#footnote-16"><sup id="footnote-ref-16">16</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     And many many more
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Software that's as endlessly customizeable as Emacs allows for all kinds of personal tweaks and touches. Over the year's I've built up my own collection of these and it continues to grow as I learn new things about Emacs.
   </p>
   <h4 id="custom-keybindings">
    <a href="#custom-keybindings">→ </a>Custom Keybindings
   </h4>
   <p>
    Last but not least: most folks will end up wanting to change a key binding at some point. Some go as far as to change the entire paradigm of the keybinds to do something like offer Vim bindings.

    I keep most of the default Emacs bindings but have changed more than a handful to suit my own needs. Some of these are defined with their related packages, others are just general additions or changes to some default Emacs binding. <a href="#footnote-17"><sup id="footnote-ref-17">17</sup></a>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you've never done so, I highly encourage taking a look at <code>M-x describe-bindings RET</code>. It's a high-level view of all bindings in your setup.
   </p>
   <h3 id="no-abstractions-">
    <a href="#no-abstractions-">→ </a>No Abstractions?
   </h3>
   <p>
    Someone on reddit has pointed out that straight.el and use-package are in fact both abstractions. That's a fair point, but in this case I am talking about tools versus kitchen sinks. The abstractions I mentioned in this entry's intro are the kitchen sink variety, whereas straight.el and use-package are more like the tools you would use to build the kitchen sink. <a href="#footnote-18"><sup id="footnote-ref-18">18</sup></a>
   </p>
   <p>
    I don't intend to make the argument "abstractions are bad"; they are not in and of themselves a bad thing, of course. Opinions may vary on when one crosses that line, though.

   <p>
    This was definitely not written for the unitiated, but I hope it was somewhat useful as a reference to "modding" Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    In particular, I'd like to highlight the power and usefulness of managing the editor configuration with Lisp code rather than clicking endlessly through some user interface (the general experience of most other editors).
   </p>
   <p>
    Having Lisp specifically and having it so tightly integrated with Emacs is where the majority of this power comes from. Learning to use it and work with it has been and continues to be a really great experience for me.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>I've already written some stuff here. I read it again and wiped it out. It was self-righteous. I hate self-righteous. I could talk about how I hate self-righteous, but I won't, because that would be self-righteous. See? It's hard to blog without being self-righteous.</p>
<p>I mostly wanted a technical blog, with an occasional sprinkle of life in it, like a picture or something. But mostly technical. Tech blogs I like fall into two overlapping categories: informative and entertaining. Sometimes both. Myself, I sure manage to deliver both in the physical world. "Could you see that bug I bump into?" "Yeah, let's look at that, aha, oh,<em> not this code, </em>SHIT, this thing sucks, it's a torrent of shit, man, it's a ShitTorrent we have here. Ewww, this is so disgusting, wait, what do you mean _next==-1, -1 MY ASS, what the hell… um… get_what?! <em>Here's</em> that stupid fucking bug! Have a nice day." See? Informative <em>and </em>entertaining. Sometimes I even gather little audiences looking over my shoulder when I debug, all because profanity is my number one debugging tool. Catches all the bugs in a snap. Trust me.</p>
<p>And that is loads of fun. Trouble is, it's not necessarily the kind of thing people want to get as a response for their next HTTP request. So I think I'll go for "informative" as first priority. If it works out at all. I have this problem with scaling communication. According to my estimations, the quality of my communication is inversely proportionate to the number of people listening (or people that I think are listening). That is, you get 100% face-to-face with nobody around, 50% if there's two of you and so on. All the way down to a whopping 1% of my exceptional rhetorical skills when I think I'm talking to an audience.</p>
<p>With this kind of personality, blogging is pretty hard. Seems like there's no reason to bother, then, but I think I will, because there's stuff in my brain that wants to come out. I recently spoke to a guy with lots of experience, in a broad sense. He's previously told me a couple of times how it would be wiser to keep my mouth shut in certain contexts. But this time, he said, "sometimes it's extremely hard to hold it when I hear something stupid". What I think happens is, our brains are really cells of a larger brain (<a title="shaped like the Internet" href="http://xkcd.com/192/">shaped like the Internet</a>, of course); when stuff wants to come out, they <em>have </em>to let it out.</p>
<p>And this is going to be in English, because writing about programming in Russian or Hebrew, which are my other options, is frigging <em>ridiculous</em>. Fellow Russians and/or Israelis, stop doing that! You ought to put so many English words into your text, like "threads", "namespaces", "closures", that you end up switching languages twice per sentence. Or you can use those <em>moronic </em>translations of such words. That still counts as switching between languages – one good one and one stupid one. Just write the whole thing in English; makes it way more machine-readable, too (you know, vi). And if your English, like mine, is really just a first-order approximation rather than the real thing, it's not <em>your </em>problem – you won't notice. The native English speakers shouldn't have had their ancestors conquer that much land; now, they'll just have to put up with the consequences.</p>

But she was soon convinced and made the trip to Chilliwack to collect the phone, which amazingly still works.</p>  <p>Clayton Helkenberg&nbsp;and his wife Heather found the lost iPhone 11 during a sweep of the lake bottom under the water park at Harrison Lake — part&nbsp;of a hobby that includes the odd treasure find, but mostly just lots of&nbsp;garbage clean up.</p>  <p>Ghodsi dropped the phone in the water in early September, during a ride on the bumper boats — photos recovered from the phone show her still smiling moments before the mishap.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5939063.1614985154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/fatemeh-ghodsi.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5939063.1614985154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/fatemeh-ghodsi.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5939063.1614985154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/fatemeh-ghodsi.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5939063.1614985154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/fatemeh-ghodsi.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5939063.1614985154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/fatemeh-ghodsi.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5939063.1614985154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/fatemeh-ghodsi.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Fatemeh Ghodsi gives the peace sign as she and her friend are seen riding bumper boats at Harrison Lake in early September. Moments later, Ghodsi's phone was lost at the bottom of the lake.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Fatemeh Ghodsi)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"I was in a situation where I kind of lost balance and dropped it in the water," she said, adding that the water park staff convinced her it would be impossible to find the phone in the deep water.</p>  <p>"Distressed and in tears, we went back to Vancouver just kind of hopeless," said Ghodsi.</p>    <p>She soon bought a new phone, and came to terms with the lost photos, contacts, and other personal information that hadn't been backed up.</p>  <h2>YouTubing&nbsp;diver</h2>  <p>Helkenberg&nbsp;has been snorkeling, swimming&nbsp;and diving for years, but at the start of 2020 — with extra time on his hands after being laid off — he started putting more effort into searching for lost items in the water, as well as doing trash cleanup missions.</p>  <p>Sometime he goes on his diving missions with friends and his wife.&nbsp;He even started a YouTube channel to document his finds.</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ifzizYAf-hs" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>Last year, he found more than a hundred pairs of sunglasses, 26 cellphones and two GoPro cameras. This year, he's already counted 35 pairs of sunglasses, five phones and one GoPro.</p>  <p>His underwater work has even attracted some <a href="https://www.theprogress.com/news/chilliwack-diver-retrieves-items-dropped-in-cultus-lake/" target="_blank">media attention</a>, including a report&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/bc-news/divers-haul-792-pounds-of-trash-out-of-cultus-lake-3364548" target="_blank">359 kilograms of trash he and friends pulled from Cultus Lake</a> earlier this year.</p>  <p>This week, he was at Harrison Lake — the water is much shallower now than it was in the summer, and according to&nbsp;Helkenberg, it's quite clear.

It was kind of like a zombie phone coming back to me, because I'd totally made peace with it being gone," she said.</p>    <p>Ghodsi said the microphone is broken and the speaker sounds weird, but everything else is in perfect shape; the battery health is still at 96 per&nbsp;cent.</p>  <p>She's thankful for the phone's recovery and inspired that Helkenberg makes the effort to reunite people with lost valuables, asking nothing in return. But the experience has left Ghodsi even more impressed by his trash cleanup work, saying it's a reminder to keep our water clean.</p>  <p>"It gives me so much hope for the good that's out there," she said.</p>  <p>As for the next time she takes a ride on the bumper boats?&nbsp;Ghodsi said she'll either leave her phone and valuables on the shore&nbsp;or keep them securely stowed in a pocket.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Do you have more to add to this story?
