<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><p> 5 minute read</p><p><strong> Published:</strong> <time datetime="2021-03-04T00:00:00-08:00">March 04, 2021</time></p></header><section itemprop="text"><p>In the <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">previous post</a>, I discussed the basics regarding the stability of fixed points of a dynamical system and explained it with a simple continuous-time one-dimensional example. In this post, I will discuss fixed points for a general case of a continuous-time $n$-dimensional system.</p><h4 id="fixed-point">Fixed point</h4><p>Just to reiterate, if the ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $\eqref{eq:1}$ represents a dynamical system:</p>\[\dot x = f(x) \label{eq:1}\]<p>Fixed points of this system are given by the roots of the equation $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\begin{equation} \dot x = f(x) = 0 \label{eq:2} \end{equation}\]<h2 id="fixed-points-of-multi-dimensional-system">Fixed points of Multi-dimensional system</h2><p>My <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">previous post</a> only explained the definition of fixed point and provided an example with a scalar-valued dynamical system. Now, lets discuss a case of multi-dimensional ODE.</p><p>We will start with the system given by equation $\eqref{eq:3}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x} = \mathbf{f(x)} \label{eq:3}\]<p>where $\mathbf{f}$ is a vector-valued function, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{\dot x}$ are $n$-dimensional vectors:</p>\[\mathbf{x, \dot x} \in \mathcal{R}^{n} \label{eq:4}\]<p>We find the fixed points (a.k.a. equilibrium states) of the system by following $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x_{eq}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) = \mathbf{0} \label{eq:5}\]<p>The roots of $\eqref{eq:5}$ will give us the value of $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., fixed points of our multi-dimensional system.</p><h2 id="stable-and-unstable-fixed-points">Stable and Unstable Fixed Points</h2><p>We analyzed the system in a one-dimensional case (<a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">here</a>) using a small perturbation $\delta$ at the equilibrium condition of the system. We will follow the similar procedure here as well.</p><p>We evaluated $\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ to see if our fixed point is stable or unstable. In case of one-dimensional system, it was easy since $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&gt;0$ is unstable fixed point $x_{eq}$ while it is stable when $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&lt;0$. In case of high-dimensional system, we cannot do this.</p><p>To analyze the behavior of our $n$-dimensional system at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, we will introduce the perturbation $\mathbf{\delta x}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$. Thus, we end up with the following:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \dot {\delta x}} &amp;= \mathbf{f(x_{eq}+\delta x)} \label{eq:6} \end{align}\]<p>Using Taylor expansion on $\eqref{eq:6}$:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \delta \dot x = f(x_{eq}) + f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime \prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \label{eq:7} \end{align}\]<p>But, we know at fixed points, equation $\eqref{eq:5}$ holds and thus, $\eqref{eq:7}$ reduces to $\eqref{eq:8}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime\prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \end{align}\] \[\mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + H.O.T. \label{eq:8}}\]<p>We can ignore the higher order terms $\mathbf{H.O.T.}$ for values of $\mathbf{\delta{x}}$ close to $\mathbf{0}$, resulting in equation $\eqref{eq:9}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x \label{eq:9}} \end{align}\]<p>$\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ is the Jacobian of $\mathbf{f(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., a <strong>linear approximation</strong> of our dynamical system $\mathbf{f(x)}$ near $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ (you can refer <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/03/vector-calculus/#jacobian-aka-derivative-of-vector-valued-function">this</a> for further details on Jacobian).</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \left[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{2}}, \dots, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{n}} \right] \label{eq:11}\\ \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial{f_{1}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{2}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:12} \end{align}\]<p>Using this Jacobian, equation $\eqref{eq:12}$, at our fixed point $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ for the dynamical system under consideration, we can calculate its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors"><strong>eigenvalues</strong></a> and interpret the results of the fixed point.</p><p>Therefore, we find the eigenvalues for equation $\eqref{eq:13}$,</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) \mathbf{x_{eq}} = \lambda \mathbf{x_{eq}} \label{eq:13} \end{align}\]<p>Here, $\lambda$ denotes the eigenvalue of the system. The roots of $\eqref{eq:13}$ are the eigenvalues the dynamical system at the fixed point $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x_{eq}}$.</p><h3 id="eigenvalue-interpretation-">Eigenvalue interpretation <a name="eigen_value_interpretation"></a></h3><p>For a continuous-time nonlinear dynamical system given by $\eqref{eq:3}$, the eigenvalues $\lambda$ that are found as roots of equation $\eqref{eq:13}$ can be interpreted as:</p><ul><li>If any of the eigenvalues have a real part $Re(\lambda)&gt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is an unstable fixed point.</li><li>If all $Re(\lambda)&lt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a stable fixed point.</li><li>If $\lambda=0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a neutral fixed point.</li><li>If eigenvalues $\lambda$ are complex conjugates, i.e., $Im(\lambda) \ne 0$: The dynamical system has oscillatory behavior around the fixed point.</li></ul><h3 id="important-points-to-note-regarding-this-article">Important points to note regarding this article</h3><p>In this post, we discussed a general case of interpreting the fixed points of a dynamical system. By general, I mean $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is a non-linear, continuous-time vector-valued function representing a dynamical system. Below are certain points one should note about any non-linear dynamical system:</p><ul><li>We assumed that the system is non-linear and linearized it using Taylor series expansion near its fixed point (a.k.a. equilibrium).</li><li>We evaluated the stability of a fixed point <strong>near</strong> the equilibrium condition by perturbing the system ($\mathbf{x_{eq}}+\mathbf{\delta x}$).</li><li>This approach of interpreting the stability of the system by linearizing it near the equilibrium <strong>does not tell much</strong> about a system’s asymptotic behavior at large.<ul><li>We only understand how the system behaves <strong>locally</strong> or <strong>in the neighborhood of the fixed points</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>In practical or real-world systems, it may not be possible to interpret the global stability characteristics of the system. Thus, the stability analysis around the neighborhood of the fixed point is useful for many practical applications such as sustaining a non-linear system’s state near or at the fixed point.</li><li>In general, global asymptotic behaviors of any non-linear dynamical system can be complex and there are no systematic methods to predict and analyze such behaviors.</li></ul><h3 id="references-and-further-readings">References and Further Readings:</h3><ul><li>Deshpande, A.

March 4, 2021 | https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Compensation: the word alone is enough to trigger a fight-or-flight reaction in many. But we in technology have the good fortune of being in a well-compensated domain, so why does this issue induce such anxiety when our basic needs are clearly covered? If it needs to be said, it's because compensation isn't merely about the currency we redeem in exchange for our labors, but rather it is a proxy for how we are <em>valued</em> in a larger organization. This, in turn, brings us to our largest possible questions for ourselves, around things like meaning and self-worth.</p><p>So when we started Oxide -- as in any new endeavor -- compensation was an issue we had to deal with directly. First, there was the thorny issue of how we founders would compensate ourselves. Then, of course, came the team we wished to hire: hybrid local and remote, largely experienced to start (on account of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc">Oxide's outrageously ambitious mission</a>), and coming from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. How would we pay people in different geographies? How could we responsibly recruit experienced folks, many of whom have families and other financial obligations that can't be addressed with stock options? How could we avoid bringing people's compensation history -- often a reflection of race, gender, class, and other factors rather than capability -- with them?</p><p>We decided to do something outlandishly simple: take the salary that Steve, Jess, and I were going to pay ourselves, and pay that to everyone. The three of us live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Steve and I each have three kids; we knew that the dollar figure that would allow us to live without financial distress -- which we put at $175,000 a year -- would be at least universally adequate for the team we wanted to build. And we mean everyone literally: as of this writing we have 23 employees, and that's what we all make.</p><p>Now, because compensation is the hottest of all hot buttons, it can be fairly expected that many people will have a reaction to this. Assuming you've made it to this sentence it means you are not already lighting us up in your local comments section (thank you!), and I want to promise in return that we know some likely objections, and we'll address those. But before we do, we want to talk about the benefits of transparent uniform compensation, because they are, in a word, profound.</p><p>Broadly, our compensation model embodies our <a href="https://oxide.computer/about/">mission, principles, and values</a>. First and foremost, we believe that our compensation model reflects our principles of <b>honesty</b>, <b>integrity</b>, and <b>decency</b>. To flip it around: sadly, we have seen extant comp structures in the industry become breeding grounds for dishonesty, deceit, and indecency. Beyond our principles, our comp model is a tangible expression of several of our values in particular:</p><ul><li><p>It has set the tone with respect to <b>teamwork</b>. In my experience, the need to "quantify" one's performance in exchange for justifying changes to individual compensation are at the root of much of what's wrong in the tech industry. Instead of incentivizing people to achieve together as a team, they are incentivized to advance themselves -- usually with sophisticated-sounding jargon like OKRs or MBOs, or perhaps reasonable-sounding (but ultimately misguided) mantras like "measure everything." Even at their very best, these individual incentives represent a drag on a team, as their infrequent calibration can prevent a team from a necessary change in its direction. And at worst, they leave individuals perversely incentivized and operating in direct opposition to the team's best interest. When comp is taken out of the picture, everyone can just focus on what we need to focus on: getting this outlandish thing built, and loving and serving the customers who are taking a chance on it.</p></li><li><p>It is an expression of our <b>empathy</b>. Our approach to compensation reflects our belief in treating other people the way that we ourselves want to be treated. There are several different dimensions for this, but one is particularly visceral: because we have not talked about this publicly, candidates who have applied to Oxide have done so assuming that we have a traditional comp model, and have braced themselves for the combat of a salary negotiation. But we have spoken about it relatively upfront with candidates (before they talk to the team, for example), and (as the one who has often had this discussion) the relief is often palpable. As one recent candidate phrased it to me: "if I had known about this earlier, I wouldn't have wasted time stressing out about it!"</p></li><li><p>It is (obviously?) proof-positive of our <b>transparency</b>. Transparency is essential for building <i>trust</i>, itself one of the most important elements of doing something bold together. One of the interesting pieces of advice we got early on from someone who has had outsized, repeated success: modulo private personnel meetings, make sure that every meeting is open to everyone. For those accustomed to more opaque environments, our level of transparency can be refreshing: for example, new Oxide employees have been pleasantly surprised that we always go through our board decks with everyone -- but we can't imagine doing it any other way. Transparent compensation takes this to an unusual (but not unprecedented) extreme, and we have found it to underscore how seriously we take transparency in general.</p></li><li><p>It has allowed whole new levels of <b>candor</b>. When everyone can talk about their salary, other things become easier to discuss directly. This candor is in all directions; without comp to worry about, we can all be candid with respect to our own struggles -- which in turn allows us to address them directly. And we can be candid too when giving public positive feedback; we don't need to be afraid that by calling attention to someone's progress, someone else will feel shorted.</p></li></ul><p>These are (some of!) the overwhelming positives; what about those objections?</p><ul><li><p>Some will say that this salary is too low. While cash compensation gets exaggerated all of the time, it's unquestionable that salaries in our privileged domain have gotten much higher than our $175,000 (and indeed, many at Oxide have taken a cut in pay to work here). But it's also true that $175,000 per year puts us each in the top 5% of US individual earners -- and it certainly puts a roof over our families' heads and food in their bellies. Put more viscerally: this is enough to not fret when your kids toss the organic raspberries into the shopping cart -- or when they devour them before you've managed to get the grocery bags out of the car! And speaking of those families: nothing is more anxiety-producing than having a healthcare issue compounded by financial distress due to inadequate insurance; Oxide not only offers the best healthcare plans we could find, but we also pay 100% of monthly premiums -- a significant benefit for those with dependents.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be paying people differently based on different geographical locations. I know there are thoughtful people who pay folks differently based on their zip code, but (respectfully), we disagree with this approach. Companies spin this by explaining they are merely paying people based on their cost of living, but this is absurd: do we increase someone's salary when their spouse loses their job or when their kid goes to college? Do we slash it when they inherit money from their deceased parent or move in with someone? The answer to all of these is no, of course not: we pay people based on their work, not their costs. The truth is that companies pay people less in other geographies for a simple reason: because they can. We at Oxide just don't agree with this; we pay people the same regardless of where they pick up their mail.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't scale. This is, at some level, surely correct: it's hard to envision a multi-thousand employee Oxide where everyone makes the same salary -- but it has also been (rightly) said that startups should do things that don't scale. And while it seems true that the uniformity won't necessarily scale, we believe that the values behind it very much will!</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this makes us unlikely to hire folks just starting out in their career. There is truth to this too, but the nature of our problem at Oxide (namely, technically very broad and very deep), the size of our team (very small), and the stage of our company (still pretty early!) already means that engineers at the earliest stages of their career are unlikely to be a fit for us right now. That said, we don't think this is impossible; and if we felt that we had someone much earlier in their career who was a fit -- that is, if we saw them contributing to the company as much as anyone else -- why wouldn't we reflect that by paying them the same as everyone else?</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this narrows the kind of roles that we can hire for. In particular, different roles can have very different comp models (sales often has a significant commission component in exchange for a lower base, for example). There is truth to this too -- but for the moment we're going to put this in the "but-this-can't-scale" bucket.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't offer a career ladder. Uniform compensation causes us to ask some deeper questions: namely, what <em>is</em> a career ladder, anyway? To me, the true objective for all of us should be to always be taking on new challenges -- to be unafraid to learn and develop. I have found traditional ladders to not serve these ends particularly well, because they focus us on competition rather than collaboration. By eliminating the rung of compensation, we can put the focus on career development where it belongs: on supporting one another in our self-improvement, and working together to do things that are beyond any one of us.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be talking about equity, not cash compensation. While it's true that startup equity is important, it's also true that startup equity doesn't pay the orthodontist's bill or get the basement …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<p>author: Koh M. Nakagawa</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Apple announced that it would be moving from Intel processors to Arm-based Apple Silicon CPUs for Macs at WWDC 2020.
The Apple Silicon-based Mac Book Air and Pro were released in October 2020 with great fanfare.</p>
<p>One of the issues that arise with the CPU transition is application compatibility.
Since Apple Silicon is an Arm-based processor, applications built for Intel-based Macs will no longer work.
To solve this problem, Apple offers the following two technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Binary 2</li>
<li>Rosetta 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Universal Binary 2 is a mechanism to encapsulate binaries built for multiple architectures into a single binary, which is also called Fat Binary.
Apple has been using this technology for a long time to maintain backward compatibility.
A Mach-O loader selects the binary with the best architecture for the machine it is running on, then loads only that binary into memory to run the program.
Most macOS Big Sur system binaries are currently Fat Binaries, containing binaries built for both Arm and Intel architectures.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is a technology that translates Intel-based binaries or JIT-generated code into Arm-based binaries or code.
It is the successor to Rosetta, which was also used in the past processor transition.
There is not much information officially released by Apple.
Of course, there is no source code available, unlike the XNU kernel.
Also, at the time of writing this article, there seems to be no article that examines it in detail.</p>
<p>In this article, I introduce some reverse engineering results of Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>Why I take a closer look at Rosetta 2?</p>
<p>The reason is that I'm interested in translated binaries in Rosetta 2 and examining the possibility of exploiting them.
I presented <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/eu-20/briefings/schedule/index.html#jack-in-the-cache-a-new-code-injection-technique-through-modifying-x-to-arm-translation-cache-21324">a new code injection technique in Windows 10 on Arm at Black Hat EU</a> last December.
The code injection is achieved by modifying x86 to Arm (XTA) binary translation cache files.
This research encourages me to examine whether similar code injection techniques can be achieved with Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>In this part, I will cover the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The executables associated with Rosetta 2 and their roles</li>
<li>Analysis results of the translated binaries</li>
<li>JIT binary translation capabilities of Rosetta 2 (mainly focusing on x86_64 machine code decoding process)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, I will follow Apple's terminology when referring to architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>arm64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Apple Silicon Mac</li>
<li>x86_64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Intel-based Mac</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-analysis-environment">Setting up the analysis environment</h2>
<p>First, I show you how to set up the analysis environment.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is not installed by default on an Apple Silicon Mac.
So, you need to install it following the pop-up that appears when you run an x86_64 code for the first time.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 1 Rosetta 2 installation popup (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After the installation, a folder named <code>/Library/Apple/usr/libexec/oah/</code> (hereinafter referred to as the oah folder) is created, and you can see the following binaries installed.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/assets/rosetta_binaries.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 2 Binaries installed after Rosetta 2 installation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The role of each binary will be explained later.</p>
<p>The next step is to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).
This is because the folder that contains the translated binaries is protected by SIP and cannot be accessed by default even with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below to disable SIP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restart the OS</li>
<li>Press and hold Touch ID to boot in the recovery mode</li>
<li>Select Terminal from "Utilities" at the top of the screen</li>
<li>Type <code>csrutil disable</code> and execute</li>
<li>Restart the OS again</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, please install Xcode and Command Line Tools for Xcode to use Clang and LLDB.</p>
<h2 id="roles-of-oahd-and-oahd-helper">Roles of <code>oahd</code> and <code>oahd-helper</code></h2>
<p>First, let's create a command line application built for x86_64 and monitor system events (e.g., process creation, file-system activities, and memory mapping) when the x86_64 application runs.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    puts("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
$ clang -arch x86_64 hello.c -o hello.out # specify x86_64 as the target architecture
$ file hello.out
hello.out: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
</code></pre>
<p>To obtain several system events, I used EventMonitor created using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security Framework</a>.
I will release EventMonitor as an OSS soon.</p>
<p>Start EventMonitor and run <code>hello.out</code>.
The following jsonl file contains logs obtained by EventMonitor. The only events related to Rosetta 2 are extracted.</p>
<p><a href="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/assets/event.jsonl">event.jsonl</a></p>
<p>When you look at the first line of the logs, you can see an event where <code>/bin/zsh</code> executes <code>hello.out</code>.</p>
<pre><code>{"event":{"log":{"args":[".\/hello.out"],"cwd":{"path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri","path_truncated":false},"last_fd":4,"target":{"executable_path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri\/hello.out","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}},"type":"exec"},"target_process":{"executable_path":"\/bin\/zsh","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}}
</code></pre>
<p>After the exec system call, <code>oahd</code> daemon checks for the file <code>/var/db/oah/16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00/065b3f057e68a5474d378306e41d8b1e3e8e612b9cf9010b76449e02b607d7f0/hello.out.aot</code>.</p>
<pre><code>... (the oahd checks for the AOT file)
{"event":{"log":{"relative_target":"var\/db\/oah\/16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00\/065b3f057e68a5474d378306e41d8b1e3e8e612b9cf9010b76449e02b607d7f0\/hello.out.aot","source_dir":{"path":"\/","path_truncated":false}},"type":"lookup"},"target_process":{"executable_path":"\/Library\/Apple\/usr\/libexec\/oah\/oahd","group_id":426,"pid":426,"ppid":1,"session_id":426}}
</code></pre>
<p>The file with the extension <code>.aot</code> contains the result of the translation from x86_64 to arm64.
We refer to this file as the AOT file.
The name <code>.aot</code> comes from Ahead-Of-Time, which means that the translation is performed before a thread actually starts.
The <code>oahd</code> is the management daemon for the AOT files.</p>
<p>Since this is the first time we run <code>hello.out</code>, the <code>oahd</code> cannot find the corresponding AOT file. So, it creates a new AOT file.
If the same binary in the same path has already been executed and the AOT file has been created, the <code>oahd</code> uses it.</p>
<p>You can see the folder named <code>/var/db/oah</code> in the above logs.
This folder has a <code>Oah.version</code> file at the top, which is supposed to contain the version information for Rosetta 2.
Also, this folder has <code>16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00</code> folder.
We can see that multiple folders are containing AOT files in it.
The names of these folders are SHA-256 hash values that are calculated from both the contents of the file in x86_64 code and the path where it was executed.</p>
<pre><code># /var/db/oah contains the Oah.version file and 16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00 folder

				<p>Because of our biological clocks, women need to consider the timing of children a lot more urgently than men.</p><p>Startups take much longer than you’d think before they become successful. You should have a 5-10 year horizon, at least.</p><p>And the period between when you start the startup and when you can relax a little is grueling and all-consuming. The focus that’s required at first will probably force you to cut back on almost everything in your life, making a healthy work/life balance nearly impossible.</p><p>Startups are also unpredictable. In the early stages, you can’t plan too far in the future and arrange your life neatly around your plans, as you might with a job as an employee in the corporate world.</p><p>So you are working around the clock—so busy that you can’t focus on much outside of work, not knowing what startup disaster is around the corner, and maybe with no end in sight for years. But you know you want a family someday, either with your current partner or someone you haven’t even had the time to meet yet.</p><p>Because startups can cause you to neglect much of your own life, women founders need to be really proactive about their fertility. Especially if you want to buy more time before the window shuts on your childbearing years.</p><p>My advice: Freeze your eggs/embryos.</p><p>I wish I had. Life with my company whizzed by and it wasn’t until my late 30s when I had a child. After a year, I started working on baby #2. Three miscarriages later, I finally woke up to the urgency of the situation and went to a fertility doctor.</p><p>The next few years were consumed by IVF cycles. My obsession to have another baby grew with each failed cycle. I’d be on an emotional roller coaster waiting for the various results, praying that this time was the magical one. It never was. My eggs were just too old, I think. After 8 rounds with not one viable embryo to transfer, I decided I had to move on, to focus on my kid and all the really great things in my life. But the what-ifs still haunt me, privately.</p><p>Aspects of getting your eggs retrieved and/or frozen can be really awful. It’s extremely expensive if not covered by your medical insurance. The drugs can wreak havoc on moods and emotions. Between all the doctor’s appointments and the various shots (which cause serious bruising) you have to give yourself several times each day, it’s quite time consuming. &nbsp;And it’s stressful. At least it was for me. The stakes feel so high.</p><p>But nothing is as awful as it not working out. It’s a type of depressing that’s difficult to describe concisely.</p><p>It might seem weird or somehow frivolous to freeze your eggs—and especially to freeze embryos if you’re already married. (Though it’s becoming more mainstream as companies offer egg freezing as an employee benefit.) But freezing is worth it simply because it gives you more options as you get older.</p><p>Until they go through it themselves, few people realize how hard Mother Nature can be in the fertility department. The older you are, the tougher the blows. So if you want a biological child, the best thing you can do is prepare. You don’t want to be like me and wake up one day and it’s too late.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/controls.png" width="100%" alt="Access controls overview"></p>

<h2 id="evergreen-challenge">Evergreen Challenge</h2>

<p>Every cloud has its own identity and access management system. AWS and Google use a bunch
of JSON files specifying various rules. Open source projects like Kubernetes support
three concurrent access control models - attribute-based, role-based and
a webhook access control, all expressed using YAML. Some teams are going as far as
inventing their own programming language to solve this evergreen problem.</p>

<p>As many engineers before us, we faced the challenge of choosing the
design and the tooling from the kaleidoscope of JSON, YAML and custom languages
for our own software’s access controls. Which system is the best, and can there be one language to rule them all?
What are the properties of a good access control system, and what mistakes of the past should we avoid?</p>

<h2 id="time-sharing-and-first-pen-testers">Time Sharing and First Pen-testers</h2>

<p>In the early 1960s one computer could be accessed by one person, program and team at a time.
Computers were quite expensive; a PDP-1, for example, would cost you a whopping $120,000.
That’s close to $1M adjusted for inflation in 2021.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/pdp-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="PDP-1 in a computer history museum"></p>

<p><em>DEC PDP-1 in a computer history museum</em></p>

<p>You could securely use the computer for different applications as long as the files and data for
different projects were kept separate. That was a serious bottleneck, and by the mid-sixties manufacturers offered time-sharing systems
that allowed many folks to use computers at the same time.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/time-sharing.jpg" width="100%" alt="Fernando Corbató with MIT's IBM 7090"></p>

<p><em>Fernando Corbató - researcher working on time sharing with MIT’s IBM 7090</em></p>

<p>The arrival of time sharing made folks at the U.S. Air Force worried.
There could be two programs residing in the storage and sharing compute and memory at the same time.
What if a program working on a lower privilege level hacked the system and gained access to sensitive data of another program?</p>

<p>To assess the scope of the problem, USAF formed a special task force to
figure out the impact of such hacks and come up with a solution.
The team came back with some bad news: operating systems at the time were not designed
at all to protect from a malicious program. The executable had almost unrestricted
capability to reference any main and auxiliary memory locations.
The task force concluded that a new approach was needed [1]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The operating systems were not designed to be secure, provide a malicious user
with any number of opportunities to subvert the operating system itself.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>A system designed to be secure, containing;</p>

<p>A) An adequate system access control mechanism</p>

<p>B) An authorization mechanism</p>

<p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="bell-la-padula-security-model">Bell-La Padula Security Model</h2>

<p>In 1972, two computer scientists were assigned with the task of designing such a system [2].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the summer of 1972, The MITRE Corporation initiated its task to produce a report titled “Secure Computer Systems.”
The modeling task fell to Len La Padula and me. David E Bell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1972-1974 David E. Bell and Leonard J. La Padula came up with the theoretical foundations of access control systems [3]
and then worked with programmers to implement that in the most promising O.S. at the time — Multics [4].
In the Multics paper, they defined elements of both models still used to this day — subjects,
objects and access control lists.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>subjects</code> are actors, like processes and programs in execution.</li>
<li><code>objects</code> are passive things, like data, files, programs, subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/subjects-objects.png" width="100%" alt="Subjects accessing objects"></p>

<p><em>Subjects accessing objects. Here and below are the original figures from the paper.</em></p>

<p>Subjects can access objects. These access modes are governed by access <code>attributes</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>e</code> - no access, <code>r</code> - read-only, <code>a</code> - can write, but not read, <code>w</code> - can read and write.</li>
</ul>

<p>They defined access of subject to object with a triple:</p>
<pre><code>(subject, object, attribute)</code></pre>
<p>Objects are organized in a tree-like structure, forming a hierarchy.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/object-structure.png" width="100%" alt="Object structure"></p>

<p><em>Object structure</em></p>

<p>An access matrix specifies access modes (<code>e</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>w</code>) in which subjects can access objects.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/access-matrix.png" width="100%" alt="Access Matrix"></p>

<p>Because MITRE corporation’s research was funded by the military, you would find a couple of parts unfamiliar to
most Unix users — category and classification levels for the U.S. Military — “unclassified”, “confidential”, “secret”, “top secret”.
Categories are general topics such as “Nuclear”, “NATO” or “Crypto”.</p>

<p>Security level assigned to an individual and object is a pair:</p>
<pre><code>(classification, set of categories)</code></pre>
<p>A user can access a document if their security level “dominates” the document level:</p>
<pre><code>(class 1, category-set 1) dominates (class 2, category-set 2) if and only if

class 1&gt;= class 2 and category-set 1 includes category-set 2 as a subset</code></pre>
<p><strong>Simple Security Property</strong></p>

<p>The researchers have defined a first property, as a simple security property:</p>

<p>For a triplet <code>(subject, object, read)</code> the security level of a subject always “dominates” security level of an object.
In other words, subjects can only read objects with the same or lower security level.
This property is also sometimes called “Read down” or “ss-property”.</p>

<p><strong>Star Property</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula noticed that “simple security property” is not enough to protect classified
information. A malicious program could pass classified information along by reading the classified
docs on one level and writing on lower level:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/star-property.png" width="100%" alt="Star property"></p>

<p>They called it “*-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in any state, if a subject has simultaneous “observe” access to object-1 and “alter”
access to object-2, then level (object-1) is dominated by level (object-2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you cannot read objects at higher security level and write
to objects at lower security level. Some folks call this property “Write Up”.
With this rule in place, any system drifts towards higher and higher clearance level
documents and it creates a practical problem — what if you still need to communicate the
level “down”? They defined “trusted subjects”, exceptions to the “*-property”
rule to communicate some information down and lower clearance of the documents.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary and Mandatory</strong></p>

<p>To conform to military regulations, the researchers defined a “mandatory” or “non-discretionary” security policy —
an individual may not exercise their judgment to violate access standard, and the enforcement
is mandatory.</p>

<p>Two systems have emerged: Mandatory Access Controls (MAC), in which individuals
have no say in whether to set up their access levels, and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), in which folks
have some say who can access what.</p>

<p>Discretionary security is defined by access matrix above and specified as “ds-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if (subject-i, object-j, attribute-x) is a current access … then attribute-x is recorded
in the (subject-i, object-j) component of M …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, subjects can access objects if there is a matching access attribute
in the matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Security Theorem</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula defined “Basic security theorem” as a combination of
“ss-property”, “*-property” and “ds-property’.</p>

<p>In their assessment, the system is secure if:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users can only read resources at lower or equal security levels (Read Down)</li>
<li>Subjects cannot read objects at higher level and write to objects at lower level (Write Up)</li>
<li>System enforces access attributes on any subject-object access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The researchers were excited about “inductive nature” of the Basic Security Theorem — the system
will stay secure through all transitions as long as these three rules are enforced.</p>

<p>In the security world, this is also called security invariant — a property that system
keeps true at all times despite all the changes.</p>

<p><strong>Multics</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/multics.jpg" width="100%" alt="Visicalc on Multics"></p>

<p><em>Visicalc running on Multics</em></p>

<p>Based on this paper, Multics engineers introduced access control lists — <code>ACL</code>.
Multics “ACLs” were composed of <code>(process, ring bracket)</code> pairs, where process is analogue of
the paper’s subject and ring bracket is a clearance level.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/acls.png" width="100%" alt="Multics ACLs"></p>

<p><em>Multics ACLs. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>Objects could be “directory segments”, data segments, certain I/O devices, certain
address spaces and sockets.</p>

<p>Multics stored ACLs in the parent directory of an object and manipulated them
by altering the directory properties. Control over an object was represented
by write permission on an object’s directory.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/segment.png" width="100%" alt="Adding Segment to DIR"></p>

<p><em>Adding Segment to DIR. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>A request to give access to an object is allowed only if the requesting subject
has current <code>w</code> access to the parent of the object.</p>

<p>Imagine a situation when a user created unclassified folder <code>Or</code>, then in it,
created a secret folder <code>O1</code> and placed unclassified file <code>O2</code> in it.</p>

<p><em>A need for compatibility. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>An unclassified user can’t access the file <code>O2</code> because they can’t access the secret folder <code>O1</code>.
This would have violated the ss-property — because unclassified users can’t read the
secret data and *-property, where users can’t read secret data and write to non-secret files
at the same time. They called it “The need for compatibility” — a child’s object
security levels should be higher than the parent’s object security levels.</p>

<p>Chances are, you are using discretionary access control implementation of the Bell-La-Padula
model every time you access a file on your system.</p>

<p>Unix devs were frustrated with Multics’ complexity. Even Unix itself is a pun on Multics —
“Uniplex information and computing service”,  compared to Multics’  “Multiplex information and computer services”.
They dropped most of the complex stuff and kept only the discretionary part securing access to files with permissions.</p>

<p>DAC defines an owner of a resource, for example a file. A file owner specifies what others
can do to this file. Linux access control list system defines a set of permissions - read <code>(r)</code>, write <code>(w)</code> and execute <code>(x)</code>.
Users are divided into three classes: owners, groups and other. Every Linux file has a list of
access controls defined for every user class. Here is, for example an ACL for a file “animals.pl” on my computer:</p>

  <p>Shipping a new product is hard. Doing so under tight time constraints is even harder. It’s no different for data-centric products. Whether it’s a forecast, a classification tool, or a dashboard, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to ship a new data product in a seemingly impossible timeline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shopify’s Data Science team has certainly found itself in this situation more than a few times over the years. Our team focuses on creating data products that support our merchants’ entrepreneurial journeys, from their initial interaction with Shopify, to their first sale, and throughout their growth journey on the platform. Commerce is a fast changing industry, which means we have to build and ship fast to ensure we’re providing our merchants with the best tools to help them succeed.</p>
<p>Along the way, our team learned a few key lessons for shipping data products quickly, while maintaining focus and getting things done efficiently—<em>but also done right.</em> Below are four tips that are proven to help you ship new products fast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investing time in a design sprint pays off down the line as you approach deadlines. The design sprint (created by <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank" title="Google Ventures" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Ventures</a>) is “a process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping and testing ideas with customers.” Sprints are great for getting a new data product off the ground quickly because they carve out specific time blocks and resources for you and your team to work on a problem. The Shopify Data Science teams make sprints a common practice, especially when we’re under a tight deadline. When setting up new sprints, here are the steps we like to take:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose an impactful problem to tackle. </em></strong>We focus on solving problems for our merchants, but in order to do that, we first have to uncover what those problems are by asking questions. <em>What</em> is the problem we’re trying to solve? <em>Why </em>are we solving this problem? Asking questions empowers you to find a problem worth tackling, identify the right technical solution and ultimately drive impact.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Assemble a small sprint team</em></strong>: Critical to the success of any sprint is assembling a small team (no more than 6 or 7) of highly motivated individuals. Why a small team? It’s easier to stay aligned in a smaller group due to better communication and transparency, which means it’s easier to move fast.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose a sprint Champion:</em></strong> This individual should be responsible for driving the direction of the project and making decisions when needed (should we use solution A or B?). Assigning a Champion helps remove ambiguity and allow the rest of the team to focus their energy on solving the problem in front of them.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Set your sprint dates:</em></strong> Timeboxing is one of the main reasons why sprints are so effective. By setting fixed dates, you're committing your team to focus on shipping on a precise timeline. Typically, a sprint lasts up to five days. However, the timeline can be shortened based on the size of the project (for example, three days is likely enough time for creating the first version of a dashboard that follows the impact of COVID-19 on the business’s acquisition funnel).</li>
</ol>
<p>With your problem identified, your team set up, and your dates blocked off, it’s now time to sprint. Keep in mind while exploring solutions that solving a data-centric problem with a non-data focused approach can sometimes be simple and time efficient. For instance, asking a user for its preferred location rather than inferring it using a complex heuristic.</p>

<p>Speed is critical! The first iterations of a brand new product often go through many changes. Prototypes allow for quick and cheap learning cycles. They also help prevent the sunk cost fallacy (when a past investment becomes a rationale for continuing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the data world, a good rule of thumb is to leverage spreadsheets for building a prototype. Spreadsheets are a versatile tool that help accelerate build times, yet are often underutilized by data scientists and engineers. By design, spreadsheets allow the user to make sense of data in messy contexts, with just a few clicks. The built-in functions cover most basic use cases:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>cleaning data by hand rapidly</li>
<li>displaying graphs</li>
<li>computing basic ranking indices</li>
<li>formatting output data.</li>
</ul>
<p>While creating a robust system is desirable, it often comes at the expense of longer building times. When releasing a brand new data product under a tight timeline, the focus should be on developing prototypes fast.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Sheet dashboard evaluating Inbound Leads.  The dashboard consists of 6 charts.  The 3 line charts on the left measure Lead Count, Qualification Rate %, and Time to Qualification in Minutes.  The 3 bar charts on the right  measure Leads by Channel, Leads by Country, and Leads by Last Source Touched." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455">
<figcaption>An example of a dashboard prototype created within Google Sheets.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite a strong emphasis on speed, a prototype should still look and feel professional. For example, the first iteration of the <a href="https://www.shopify.my/blog/marketing-attribution" target="_blank" title="Marketing Attribution: Seeing the Customer Journey More Clearly" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marketing attribution tool</a> developed for Shopify’s Revenue team was a collection of SQL queries automated by a bash script. The output was then formatted in a spreadsheet. This allowed us to quickly make changes to the prototype and compare it to out-of-the-box tools. We avoided any wasted effort spinning up dashboards, production code, as well as any sentimental attachment to the work, which made it easier for the best solution to win.</p>

<p>When building a new data product, it’s tempting to spend lots of time on a flashy machine learning algorithm. This is especially true if the product is supposed to be “smart”. Building a machine learning model for your first iteration can cost a lot of time. For example, when sprinting to build a lead scoring system for our Sales Representatives, our team spent 80% of the sprint gathering features and training a model. This left little time to integrate the product with the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank" title="Customer Relationship Management on Wikipedia" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) infrastructure, polish it, and ask for feedback. A simple ranking using a proxy metric would be much faster to implement for the first iteration. The time gained would allow for more conversations with the users about the impact, use and engagement with the tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took that lesson to heart in our next project when we built a sales forecasting tool. We started with a linear regression using only two input variables that allowed us to have a prototype ready in a couple of hours. Using a simple model allowed us to ship fast and quickly learn whether it solved our user’s problem. Knowing we were on the right track, we then built a more complex model using machine learning.</p>
<p>Focus on building models that solve problems and can be shipped quickly. Once you’ve proven that your product is effective and delivers impact, then you can focus your time and resources on building more complex models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shipping fast also means shipping the right product. In order to stay on track, gathering feedback from users is invaluable! It allows you to build the right solution for the problem you’re tackling. Take the time to talk to your users, before, during, and after each build iteration. Shadowing them, or even doing the task yourself is a great return on investment.</p>
<p>Gathering feedback is an art. Entire books and research papers are dedicated to it. Here are the two tips we use at Shopify that increased the value of feedback we’ve received:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Ask specific questions.</em> Asking, “Do you have any feedback?” doesn’t help the user direct their thoughts. Questions like, “How do you feel about the speed at which the dashboard loads?” or “Are you able to locate the insights you need on this dashboard to report on top of funnel performance?” are more targeted and will yield richer feedback.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Select a diverse group of users for feedback</em>. Let’s suppose that you are building a dashboard that’s going to be used by three regional teams. It’s more effective to send a request for feedback to one person in each team rather than five people in a single team.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Form that measures Prototype A's Scoring.  The form consists of 2 questions. The first question is &quot;Is the score easy to parse and interpret? It is scored using a ranking from 1 - 5 with 1 = Very Hard and 5 = Very Easy. The 2nd question is &quot;Additional Comments&quot; and has a text field for the answer." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664">
<figcaption>Feedback our team asked for the scoring system we created. When asking for feedback, you want to ask specific questions so you can yield better feedback.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We implemented the two tips when requesting feedback from users of the sales forecasting tool highlighted in the previous section. We asked a diverse group specific questions about our product, and learned that displaying a numerical score (0 - 100) was confusing. The difference between scores wasn’t clear to the users. Instead, it was suggested to display grades (A, B, C) which turned out to be much quicker to interpret and led to a better user experience.</p>
<p>At Shopify, following these tips has provided the team with a clearer path for launching brand new data products under tight time constraints. More importantly, it helped us avoid common pitfalls like getting stuck during neverending design phases, overengineering complex machine learning systems, or building data products that users don’t use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time you’re under a tight timeline to ship a new data product, remember to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Utilize design sprints</em></strong> to help focus your team’s efforts and remove the stress of the ticking clock</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Don’t skip on prototyping,</em></strong> it’s a great way to fail early</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Avoid machine learning</em></strong> (for first iterations) to avoid being slowed down by unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Talk to your users</em></strong> so you can get a better sense of what problem they’re facing and what they need in a product</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In one of my recent training courses, a student informed me that both clang-tidy
and PVS-Studio were complaining about some code of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code>std::vector&lt;Widget&gt; widgets;
~~~
widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both tools flagged this line as “bad style.”
clang-tidy even offered a (SARCASM ALERT) helpful fixit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace]
    widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~
            emplace_back(
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The student dutifully changed the line, and both tools reported their
satisfaction with the replacement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs a <code>Widget</code>
into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p>The student’s replacement materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&gt;(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs
a <code>Widget</code> into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>The change clang-tidy meant to suggest — and in fact <em>did</em> suggest,
if you pay very close attention to the underlining in the fixit — was actually this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(foo, bar, baz);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This version does <em>not</em> materialize any <code>Widget</code> temporaries. It simply
passes <code>foo, bar, baz</code> to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;&gt;(Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;)</code>,
which constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector using whatever
constructor of <code>Widget</code> best matches that bunch of arguments.</p>

<h2 id="emplace_back-is-not-magic-c11-pixie-dust"><code>emplace_back</code> is not magic C++11 pixie dust</h2>

<p>Even a decade after C++11 was released, I still sometimes see programmers assume
that <code>emplace_back</code> is somehow related to move semantics. (In the same way that
some programmers assume lambdas are somehow the same thing as <code>std::function</code>,
you know?) For example, they’ll rightly observe that this code makes an
unnecessary copy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.push_back(w);  // Copy-constructor alert!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So they’ll change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.emplace_back(w);  // Fixed? Nope!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(const Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p>The replacement constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&amp;&gt;(Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>What the student should have done is ask the compiler to make an
<em>rvalue</em> reference to <code>w</code>, by saying either</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t matter which verb you use; what matters is the value category of
<code>w</code>. You must explicitly mention <code>std::move</code>, so that the language (and the
human reader) understand that you’re done using <code>w</code> and it’s okay for
<code>widgets</code> to pilfer its guts.</p>

<p><code>emplace_back</code> was added to the language at the same time as <code>std::move</code> — just
like lambdas were added at the same time as <code>std::function</code> — but that doesn’t
make them the same thing. <code>emplace_back</code> may “look more C++11-ish,” but it’s
not magic move-enabling pixie dust and it will never insert a move in a place
you don’t explicitly request one.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-else-is-equal-prefer-push_back-to-emplace_back">When all else is equal, prefer <code>push_back</code> to <code>emplace_back</code></h2>

<p>So, given that these two lines do the same thing and are equally efficient
at runtime, which should I prefer, stylistically?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I recommend sticking with <code>push_back</code> for day-to-day use. You should definitely
use <code>emplace_back</code> when you need its particular set of skills — for example, <code>emplace_back</code>
is your only option when dealing with a <code>deque&lt;mutex&gt;</code> or other non-movable type —
but <code>push_back</code> is the appropriate default.</p>

<p>One reason is that <code>emplace_back</code> is more work for the compiler.
<code>push_back</code> is an overload set of two non-template member functions.
<code>emplace_back</code> is a single variadic template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void push_back(const Widget&amp;);
void push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;);

template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
reference emplace_back(Ts&amp;&amp;...);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you call <code>push_back</code>, the compiler must do overload resolution, but that’s all.
When you call <code>emplace_back</code>, the compiler must do template type deduction, followed
by (easy-peasy) overload resolution, followed by function template instantiation and
code generation. That’s a much larger amount of work for the compiler.</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark-program">The benchmark program</h2>

<p>I wrote a simple test program to demonstrate the difference in compiler workload.
Of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> applies:
my benchmark displays a massive difference because it’s doing <em>nothing but</em>
instantiating <code>emplace_back</code>, whereas any production codebase will be doing vastly
more other stuff relative to the number of times it instantiates <code>emplace_back</code>.
Still, I hope this benchmark gives you a sense of why I recommend “<code>push_back</code> over
<code>emplace_back</code>” and not vice versa.</p>

<p>This Python 3 script generates the benchmark:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import sys
print('#include &lt;vector&gt;')
print('#include &lt;string&gt;')
print('extern std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; v;')
for i in range(1000):
    print('void test%d() {' % i)
    print('    v.%s_back("%s");' % (sys.argv[1], 'A' * i))
    print('}')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Generate like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python generate.py push &gt;push.cpp
python generate.py emplace &gt;emplace.cpp
time g++ -c push.cpp
time g++ -c emplace.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Clang trunk on my laptop, I get consistently about 1.0s for the <code>push</code> version,
and 4.2s for the <code>emplace</code> version. This big difference is due to the fact that the
<code>push</code> version is merely code-generating a thousand <code>test</code> functions, whereas
the <code>emplace</code> version is code-generating that same thousand <code>test</code> functions <em>and</em>
another thousand template instantiations of <code>emplace_back</code> with different parameter
types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[1]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[1])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[2]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[2])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[3]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[3])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[4]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[4])
~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See, <code>push_back</code> knows that it expects a <code>string&amp;&amp;</code>, and so it knows to call the
non-explicit constructor <code>string(const char *)</code> on the caller’s side. The same
constructor is called in each case, and the temporary <code>string</code> is passed to
the same overload of <code>push_back</code> in each case. <code>emplace_back</code>, on the other hand,
is a dumb perfect-forwarding template: it doesn’t know that the relevant constructor
overload will end up being <code>string(const char *)</code> in each case. So it takes
an lvalue reference to the specific <em>array type</em> being passed by the caller.
Perfect-forwarding has no special cases for <code>const char *</code>!</p>

<p>If we change <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>vector&lt;const char *&gt;</code>, the compile-time-performance
gap widens: now it’s 0.7s for <code>push</code>, 3.8s for <code>emplace</code>. This is because we’ve cut
out some of the work that was common to both versions (constructing <code>std::string</code> objects)
without affecting the source of the gap (that one version instantiates a
thousand copies of <code>emplace_back</code> and the other doesn’t). Amdahl’s Law in action!</p>

<p>My conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>push_back</code> by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>emplace_back</code> where it is semantically significant to your algorithm
(such as when the element type’s move-constructor is absent or has been
benchmarked as expensive).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid mixing string literals and perfect-forwarding templates,
especially in repetitive machine-generated code.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The year is 1721. You are a rich person, and you want to put your
                wealth to use. You are approached by various people who buy goods in
                one part of the world, and sell them in another. They want you to
                finance some of their initial purchase and transportation costs, in
                exchange for a share of the revenue.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this being 1721, a significant fraction of shipments
                end up on the sea floor, or stolen by pirates, or gets lost to
                corrupt locals.</p>
            <p>You will be presented with a few shipments to finance, of varying
                value, ordered from low to high. They all have the same return
                relative to financing cost – your job is just to pick the most
                attractively sized suggestion.</p>
            <p>All proposed shipments have one thing in common: they will need to
                pass through a specific strait. This is critical information for
                your decision: different straits have different probabilities of
                losing the goods.</p>

            <p>You will have to consider three straits. Their true probability of
                success is unknown (and varies whenever you restart the game) but
                you get an estimation for each as a hint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bering</strong>: Very dangerous. Probability of success
                    is around 50&nbsp;%. Shipments through Bering strait
                    often have a high payoff as a result.</li>
                <li><strong>Malacca</strong>: Somewhat unsafe. Probability of
                    success is estimated to be between 60&nbsp;% and 80&nbsp;%.</li>
                <li><strong>Gibraltar</strong>: Very safe. Probability of success
                    unknown, but it seems to be over 90&nbsp;%, maybe even as high
                    as 100&nbsp;%. These shipments have relatively low payoff.</li>
            </ul>
        </div><p>I've been lazy with dependencies. Please wait while
            a gazillion HTTP requests are being performed under the hood.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/image/dns.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this month, I came back around to seriously considering an attempt at <a href="http://dinaburg.org/bitsquatting.html">bitsquatting</a>. While the prior link goes into great depth on the topic, I will attempt to give a <em>very</em> high level overview here:</p><p>If this sort of thing interests you: I tend to do stuff like this weekly. Give me a follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata">@_mattata</a></p><p>When you try to access a site by it’s domain, that domain is stored in the memory of your computer, device, whatever… in a structure that looks something like this.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101001</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td>i</td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now let’s say that the computer is running too hot, a solar flare is happening, or a cosmic ray (very real thing) flips a bit on the computer.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101000</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td><strong>h</strong></td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oh no! Now the value stored in memory is w<strong>h</strong>ndows.com instead of windows.com! When the time comes to make a connection to that domain, what happens?</p><blockquote><p>nslookup whndows.com</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>*** can’t find whndows.com: Non-existent domain</p></blockquote><p>The domain doesn’t resolve to an IP!</p><hr><p>In fact, out of the 32 valid domain names that are 1-bitflip away from windows.com 14 were available for purchase! This is a rather odd occurance as usually these are bought up by a company like Microsoft to prevent their use for phishing attempts. So I bought them. All of them. For ~$126.</p><p>(<em>If you’re a verifiably responsible party, I’m more than happy to transfer ownership of the domains. Otherwise, I’ll just hold on to them and continue to sinkhole.</em>)</p><blockquote><p>windnws.com
windo7s.com
windkws.com
windmws.com
winlows.com
windgws.com
wildows.com
wintows.com
wijdows.com
wiodows.com
wifdows.com
whndows.com
wkndows.com
wmndows.com</p></blockquote><p>Now we need to point these domains somewhere. So I rent a VPS and configure IPv4/IPv6, and create wildcard DNS entries to point to them.</p><p>Wildcard DNS works so that if I create a record saying that whndows.com points to 123.123.123.123 and someone requests abs.xyz.whndows.com, they will still get the same 123.123.123.123 DNS record as a reply. Due to the nature of this research dealing with bits being flipped, this allows me to capture any DNS lookup for a subdomain of windows.com where multiple bits have flipped.</p><p>Once we have DNS configured, we use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark</a> to perform a packet capture on the public interface of our VPS and wait for something interesting to happen.</p><p>Below is a short snippet of some interesting things that can be shared without uniquely indentifying any users.</p><p>Usage of <strong><a href="https://greynoise.io/tech">GreyNoise.io</a></strong> was key in helping to differentiate between opportunistic scanning and actual bitflip scenarios. Great product!</p><h2 id="ntp-udp-port-123-timewindowscom">NTP UDP port 123 time.windows.com</h2><p>UDP packets destined for port 123 attempting to set their computer clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
time.windows.com is the default NTP server configured for all Windows machines and they check for the time regularly. If they don’t succeed in getting the time, they try again, and again, and again.</p><p>In total, over the course of 14 days, my server recieved <strong>199,180 NTP Client connections from 626 unique IP addresses.</strong></p><p>The NTP client for windows OS has no inherent verification of authenticity, so there is nothing stopping a malicious person from telling all these computers that it’s after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038</a> and wreaking unknown havoc as the memory storing the signed 32-bit integer for time overflows.</p><p>As it turns out though, for ~30% of these computers doing that would make little to no difference at all to those users because their clock is already <em>broken</em>.</p><p>Using the tshark filter “ntp.xmt” we can extract the Transmit Timestamp, which is the time that the computer thinks it is when it asks to update the time.</p><blockquote><p>tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e ntp.xmt -2 -R ntp.xmt | sort -u</p></blockquote><pre><code>Sep 28, 1984 19:41:12.638290998 EDT

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window

[erizo] (1.821291) instance.c:32  | Showed window
</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
            SKIP_WHILE(isspace);
            float f;
            const int r = sscanf(data, "%f", &amp;f);
            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.178082) window.c:91    | Created window
[erizo] (0.178086) window.c:95    | Made context current

<p>This is back down in the noise of
"how long does the OS take to give us an OpenGL context",
which is a great place for a high-performance tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fscanf&amp;oldid=125683">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

<p>A hacker of unknown origins hacked into servers of Complify, a rapidly growing VC-funded startup. When Complify's security specialists noticed the breach, it was too late. However, unexpectedly, the hacker's actions did not seem to have been destructive in nature.</p><p>Apparently, the hacker rewrote complex backend architecture with a simple, single-node PostgreSQL instance and a bunch of cron jobs. This made the whole cluster of orchestrated containerized systems obsolete in one night. As a result, the CEO and the board of directors had no other choice but to let go 583 tech employees (nearly 40% of the workforce), as they now have literally nothing to do.</p><p>Alarmed, other startups in the industry are hiring more security specialists in order to reduce the risk of so-called <strong>"green-hat hacker"</strong> attacks.</p>

    <h2>A Terse Guide on Hiring Your First Engineering Manager</h2>
  </div><div>
    <p>Hiring an early-stage manager can bring up powerful fears of making a bad hire.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What if they ruin our culture?</li>
  <li>What if we lose good people because of them?</li>
  <li>What if they cause harm?</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>This mindset can lead to fear-driven-development of the job description. The “what-ifs” turn into a laundry list of requirements without much coherence between them, and this leads to stressful hiring experience both for the candidate (who feels like they need to be superhero to succeed) and for the folks doing the hiring (who feel like they might never find the right person.)</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-manager">What Makes A Manager?</h2>

<p>When it comes to defining a manager’s role, I encourage people to start with a simple baseline: Look for someone who is effective at <em>performance management.</em></p>

<p>That term might make you cringe depending on your experience. However, <a href="https://www.alancolquitt.com/book">modern performance management</a> is quite a bit different than the discipline that spawned the term decades ago.</p>

<p>This is a whole topic in its own right, but for our purposes, let’s define performance management as “bringing people and resources together to make the right things happen.” It’s simple, but it’s hard!</p>

<p><em>TL;DR The baseline for an effective manager is that they can lead their teams in getting from “why” to “what” to “how”</em>.</p>

<p>An effective performance manager has competency in three areas:</p>

<h3 id="direction">Direction</h3>

<p>They understand and contribute to the company’s strategy at an appropriate level.</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>See it as their job to understand and represent what the business is doing (in their area, at least)</li>
  <li>Help their reports and peers to understand that direction for themselves</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seeing their job as “protecting” their team from “the business”</li>
  <li>Talking about “the business” like a foreign entity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>

<p>They can lead their team from “why are we doing this?” to “what are we doing?”</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead teams in designing solutions to problems</li>
  <li>Contribute well as peers with other disciplines (product management, design, etc.)</li>
  <li>Effectively guide people through conflict as it arises</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Viewing their teams as “order-takers” for product management / design / etc</li>
  <li>A need to control rather than influence (e.g. requiring direct reporting lines to any area where they need to get things done)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p>They get results. This means going from “what are we doing?” to “we’re doing it!”</p>

<p>More specifically, they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the right things done</li>
  <li>Use simple, understandable measurements to know that the right things are getting done</li>
  <li>Continually grow and resource their team</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dogmatic belief in a particular project-management process</li>
  <li>Shying away from taking ownership of outcomes</li>
  <li>Can’t hold multiple priorities in balance with one another (e.g. treats people terribly to get results, or sacrifices results to treat people too gently)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-this">How Do I Use This?</h2>

<p>Starting with this short list of capabilities, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a couple of other things that are important to the job (e.g. technical skills)</li>
  <li>Use the list of capabilities you came up with to write the job description</li>
  <li>Build an interview to test for these things</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re looking for more detail, <a href="https://mikedebo.com/work/2020/11/06/hacking-structured-interviewing-for-jobs-you-dont-understand/">I wrote a guide on hiring for jobs you don’t understand well</a> that should help you put it all together.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 id="q-why-isnt-there-a-communication-section-isnt-that-an-important-skill-for-a-manager">Q: Why isn’t there a “Communication” section? Isn’t that an important skill for a manager?</h3>

<p>It is common to test for communication directly. However, I don’t think it’s specific enough.</p>

<p>Think for a moment: Have you worked with a manager who was great at communicating with other engineering teams, but struggled in group sessions with product management, design, marketing, or other roles?</p>

<p>How about someone who was great at storytelling, but who had a hard time communicating how to turn that idea into reality?</p>

<p>These are all different types of communication, but they happen in different contexts.</p>

<p>The person who does well with their teams but poorly with product and design may be more comfortable with <em>making progress</em> than with <em>creating alignment.</em> Our storyteller may be great at communicating <em>direction</em> but not so good with the rest.</p>

<p>None of these gaps are necessarily deal-breakers on their own, but they do paint a clearer picture of where manager’s strengths might lie, and this extra specificity might help you make a better hiring decision.</p>

<h3 id="q-this-directionalignmentprogress-stuff-sounds-a-bit-fluffy-arent-there-better-words-for-it">Q: This direction/alignment/progress stuff sounds a bit fluffy. Aren’t there better words for it?</h3>

<p>I tend not to use these directly with folks unless I’m explaining the underlying model. When talking about it with everyone else, you can use something like “Strategy”, “Focus”, “Execution”; or, even more simply, “Why”, “What”, and “How”.</p>

<h3 id="q-you-havent-spoken-about-leadership-at-all-arent-leadership-qualities-important-in-a-manager">Q: You haven’t spoken about leadership at all. Aren’t leadership qualities important in a manager?</h3>

<p>This is a big topic. In short, my experience is this: It takes a lot of experience and pain to become a strong leader. There are some really interesting, deeply-thought-out leadership programs out there (e.g. <a href="https://coactive.com/training/leadership-training/">Co-Active Leadership</a>) but even those will push their trainees into different forms of suffering to develop their character.</p>

<p>Performance management, however, is a pretty distinct set of skills that can be learned quickly with some dedication. I think it’s a lot more reasonable to find someone who has these skills (or who can develop them on the job) than to expect them to have a lot of difficult-to-acquire leadership qualities, especially for front-line managers who tend to be earlier in their careers.</p>

<h2 id="need-help">Need Help?</h2>

<p>I like talking about hiring. Ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedeb0">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-dibernardo-5b19189/">LinkedIn</a> if you’d like to chat.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Crossplane is often compared to HashiCorp’s Terraform. It’s common for enterprise platform teams to find Crossplane as they outgrow Terraform and look for alternatives. There are parallels between the two projects:</p><ul><li>Both allow engineers to model their infrastructure as declarative configuration</li><li>Both support managing a myriad of diverse infrastructure using "provider" plugins</li><li>Both are open source tools with strong communities</li></ul><p>The key difference is that Crossplane is a control plane, where Terraform is a command-line tool - an interface to control planes. This post touches on a handful of pain points that enterprises commonly face as they scale Terraform, and highlights how Crossplane addresses these&nbsp;issues.</p><h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2><p>Enterprises often adopt Terraform via their operations team. It’s a great way for a small team of engineers to begin to wrangle their organisation’s infrastructure. Representing infrastructure as declarative configuration allows an operations team to benefit from software engineering best practices - keeping the configuration in revision control where changes can be peer reviewed and reverted when necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Cone@0.25x.png"></figure><p>Where Terraform can fall apart is when more engineers need to collaborate to manage their organisation’s infrastructure. Terraform relies on a monolithic state file to map desired configuration to actual, running infrastructure. A lock must be held on this state file while configuration is being applied, and applying a Terraform configuration is a blocking process that can take minutes to complete. During this time no other entity - no other engineer - can apply changes to the configuration. Similarly, Terraform uses a monolithic ‘apply’ process - there’s no recommended way to modify only one piece of infrastructure within a configuration. If you use the same configuration to manage your caches and your databases you must always update both - you can’t update only your caches.</p><p>Terraform recommends breaking a monolithic configuration up into increasingly more granular configurations. So while the operations team might start with a Terraform configuration that represents ‘production’, they’re encouraged to factor that out into scoped configurations like ‘production billing’ and ‘production auth’. It’s hard to get this right up front, so it can require <em>a lot</em> of refactoring over time, and often results in a complex mesh of Terraform configurations coupled by their inputs and outputs.</p><p>Collaboration scales in Crossplane because the Crossplane Resource Model (XRM) promotes loose coupling and eventual consistency. In Crossplane every piece of infrastructure is an API endpoint that supports create, read, update, and delete operations. Crossplane does not need to calculate a graph of dependencies to make a change, so you can easily operate on a single database, even if you manage your entire production environment with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="self-service">Self Service</h2><p>Modern organisations are evolving from centralised management of infrastructure to a self service model in which an operations team - often called a platform team - defines opinionated infrastructure abstractions that the development teams they support can consume on demand. Terraform has evolved to support this model through the use of <em>modules</em>. A module is not unlike a software library. Like Crossplane, Terraform resources are high-fidelity representations of an external API resource. A module provides a simplified abstraction atop a broader configuration of these resources - for example <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws/latest">the RDS module</a> abstracts eight distinct Terraform resources into a single “RDS instance” concept.</p><p>Treating application teams as consumers of a “library” of Terraform configuration means they are subject to Terraform’s collaboration constraints. Application developers are invited to collaborate on their organisation’s infrastructure as if they were an operations team with a narrower focus. The platform team invites application development teams to share their workflow, rather than offering them a service. This means application teams must learn a new, special purpose toolset and language - Terraform and the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). It also raises the level of <em>configuration abstraction</em> for application developers without raising the level of <em>access control abstraction</em>. While the platform team can publish a module that allows an application team to manage “RDS instances”, access control remains down at the cloud provider API level and is thus framed around “database subnet groups” and “database parameter groups”.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/MulticloudCrane@0.5x-2.png"></figure><p>The Crossplane equivalent of a Terraform module is a Composite Resource - an XR. Each XR is exposed as an API endpoint. A platform team can define and document the OpenAPI schema of each XR - each API - and enforce Role Based Access Control (RBAC) at the API level. This means that if a platform team decides to frame the abstraction they offer to their development teams as “an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database” they can grant RBAC access to create, read, update, or delete an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database, rather than having to manage access to various underlying cloud concepts like RDS instances or subnet groups. Because Crossplane builds on the battle hardened Kubernetes RBAC system a platform team can easily support many teams of application developers within a single control plane. Each team can be granted access only to the abstractions they need - some might be able to manage only storage buckets, while others may be allowed to manage caches and databases.</p><p>Self service scales even further in Crossplane because any one XR may offer several classes of service. Crossplane decouples an XR’s inputs and outputs - its spec and status in Kubernetes parlance - from its implementation, which is described by a Composition. If an application developer has been granted access to create AcmeCo PostgreSQL databases, they may easily select from any of the classes of service - any of the Compositions - their platform team has declared to be compatible with said databases. These classes of service could represent production, staging, and development; AWS, Azure, and GCP; fast and slow; or any combination thereof.</p><h2 id="integration-and-automation">Integration and Automation</h2><p>Terraform sits in front of many APIs, but it does not offer its own. This leads many teams automate it by committing their Terraform configuration(s) to revision control - git - and executing Terraform as part of their CI/CD pipeline. This is an improvement relative to a team running Terraform from their laptops, but it exposes a key issue that organisations face when attempting to scale their use of Terraform. Terraform is a command line tool - not a control plane. Because it is a short lived, one-shot process it will only attempt to reconcile your desired configuration with actual infrastructure when it is invoked. Whether run from a CI/CD pipeline or a laptop Terraform is typically invoked only when an engineer <em>expects</em> that infrastructure needs updating.</p><p>Terraform’s conservative, ‘on-demand’ approach to reconciling desired with actual infrastructure state can lead to a novel deadlock. Recall that the process of applying a Terraform configuration is all-or-nothing - if you describe your caches and your databases in the same configuration you must always update both to update either. This means that if anyone in your organisation circumvents Terraform the next person to trigger a Terraform run will be faced with a surprising plan as it attempts to undo the change. Consider for example a scenario in which an engineer is paged in the middle of the night to handle an incident, makes some quick edits to the production cache configuration via the AWS console, and forgets to reflect those changes in Terraform. It’s not unheard of for infrastructure to drift so much that applying a Terraform configuration becomes a risky, intimidating proposition.</p><p>Crossplane, on the other hand, is built as a series of long lived, always-on control loops. It constantly observes and corrects an organisation’s infrastructure to match its desired configuration whether changes are expected or not. This disincentivizes teams from circumventing Crossplane. When Crossplane has been asked to manage a piece of infrastructure any change made outside it will automatically and persistently be reverted.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Terraform-Stack.svg"></figure><p>A continued theme among the pain points organisations face with Terraform is that it does not offer an API. Integrating with Terraform is challenging because it is configured using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) - HCL - and invoked by calling a command line tool. Crossplane exposes a REST API - the lingua franca of automation. Whether a team writes mostly shell scripts, mostly Python, or mostly Erlang common patterns and libraries will exist for integrating with REST APIs and thus for integrating with Crossplane.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack.svg"></figure><p>Crossplane doesn’t expose any old REST API. Building on the Kubernetes API means that teams can orchestrate all of their infrastructure - cloud and otherwise - using tools like kubectl. The same tools they use to orchestrate their containerised applications. Crossplane can even expose the details an application needs to connect to infrastructure as a Kubernetes secret to ease integration. It can be paired with projects like ArgoCD, Gatekeeper, or Velero to enable GitOps, advanced policy, and backups. Need bespoke automation? Leverage one of many well documented frameworks to build your own Kubernetes operator that integrates with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="why-not-both">Why Not Both?</h2><p>Crossplane and Terraform can both orchestrate an organisation’s infrastructure. There are similarities between the two, but each project approaches orchestration differently. Terraform offers a command-line interface to control plane APIs, while Crossplane is <em>itself</em> a control plane that can be used to build abstractions atop other control planes. Because Crossplane enables a platform team to offer their own control plane it avoids many of the challenges platform teams face when scaling Terraform.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack-with-Terraform.svg"></figure><p>Savvy readers might notice …</p></section></div>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>So I've been using my new M1-based MacBook Pro for a couple of months for a mix of development, email, and other things an <a href="https://github.com/earthly/earthly">open-source maintainer</a> does day-to-day.</p>
<p>The typical first reaction that you get when using this is "it runs my Docker stack without sounding like a plane taking off??".</p>
<p>It's a pretty amazing piece of engineering, and in many ways, I think that the ARM architecture is the future. A number of fast-growing tech giants (besides Apple) are pouring a ton of money into making ARM work for a ton of use-cases: Nvidia (trying to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/nvidia-to-buy-arm-holdings-from-softbank-for-40-billion.html">buy ARM Holdings from SoftBank</a>) and Amazon (deep investment in the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/">Graviton processors</a>) are the two that primarily come to mind.</p>
<p>As you might know, in processors low energy consumption (and low heat dissipation) often equates to the ability to scale processing efficiently for large workloads. It also means longer battery cycles for non-cloud use-cases (less waste, more bang for the buck). This is why I think ARM is the future, even if it might take a decade for the mainstream cloud to migrate over.</p>
<p>My Xeon Linux-based workstation suddenly feels old.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>All the software I need to use "just works". I found that if an ARM-native version is not available for an application, the emulated one works just fine and there's no performance drawback that I can notice. To emulate an application, you just need to install Rosetta 2. The OS will automatically detect that Rosetta is needed and prompt you to install it. However, you can also install it manually via</p>
<pre><code>/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta
</code></pre>
<p>The tools you use for development are likely still catching up to this architectural change, and will be for some time. We engineers sometimes use very low-level system capabilities. In some cases, I had to install preview editions of software, but everything worked very well for me. Here are some programs that I've tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Chrome (native)</li>
<li>✅ 1Password (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Zoom (native)</li>
<li>✅ Backblaze (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Signal (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Spotify (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ VS Code. The amd64 version works perfectly well, however, the terminal will be an amd64 process, which may cause some programs to also run as amd64. The arm64 native version is available on the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/">VS Code Insiders</a> and works really well.</li>
<li>✅ Docker. M1 native version is a must. Emulation doesn't have virtualization features, which the Docker app requires. You can download the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/">Docker App for M1</a>, which is in preview. As mentioned on the documentation page, there are some limitations currently related to HTTP proxy, VPN clients, and performance, but the Docker team is making progress fast. (A month or two ago Kubernetes wasn't working, but now it is!).</li>
<li>✅ Brew (native, encountered some issues with git, but was able to fix them)</li>
<li>✅ iTerm 2 (native)</li>
<li>✅ OBS (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Earthly (<code>v0.5.1+</code> now supports M1 natively - just <code>brew install earthly</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I should also mention that during the first few weeks I had some issues with audio skips when using Bluetooth, but an OS update fixed it (just like <a href="https://www.imore.com/fix-way-m1-mac-bluetooth-problems">Apple promissed</a>).</p>
<p>I also use a ✅ YubiKey 5C Nano and a bunch of random peripherals like a ✅ USB microphone and a ✅ dock plugged into Ethernet.</p>
<p>Languages and frameworks I've tested - most of them in Docker containers:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Go. <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin">1.16 RC adds support for building darwin/arm64 binaries</a>. I built binaries in Docker and ran them natively. Works great.</li>
<li>🟡 Java and Scala. I had issues with the JVM, experiencing random process hangs. It seems that there are no official OpenJDK builds for aarch64, however there are some community options. See more info below.</li>
<li>✅ C++ works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>🔴 .Net didn't work for me natively nor emulated. I did not investigate why though.</li>
<li>✅ Elixir works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>

<h2 id="howtotellwhatarchitectureaprogramisrunningas">How to tell what architecture a program is running as</h2>
<p>It's extremely easy to mistake the kind of architecture you run as. Rosetta 2 is that good.</p>
<p>The easiest way to tell the difference is by opening Activity Monitor and looking at the Architecture column: if it says <code>Apple</code>, it's ARM. If it says <code>Intel</code>, it's X86_64. Here's how I can tell that Zoom is an ARM process, while Spotify is an X86_64 process.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img1.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Zoom as an Apple process">
<img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img2.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Spotify as an Intel process"></p><p>If you're not sure about the terminal you're using, you can type <code>uname -m</code>. It'll say either <code>X86_64</code>, <code>arm64</code> (mac) or <code>aarch64</code> (linux). <code>arm64</code> and <code>aarch64</code> are both ARM - <code>uname</code> on Mac just reports it differently compared to Linux.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img3.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' as 'arm64'"></p><h2 id="brewissues">Brew issues</h2>
<p>One issue I encountered on both my M1 laptop and also a <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini">MacStadium MacMini</a> instance that we use for Mac testing is that Brew randomly started to complain about git missing. Not sure what the cause of this is, but it could be the fact that brew has been adding native arm support for many packages in the last few months and it's possible that this migration resulted in some inconsistencies. This is pure speculation, however, I've not researched this.</p>
<p>(In any case, a very impressive effort to switch architecture so quickly for a project that hosts so many packages!)</p>
<p>Back to fixing the issue now. Using <code>brew doctor</code> I was able to find out that Xcode needed a (re)install. Easy: <code>xcode-select --install</code>. However, the issue was still there. On the MacStadium instance, I was able to just uninstall brew and reinstall it and everything was fine. I was not as comfortable doing that on my laptop after having installed so much via casks. Instead, I was able to just remove the brew <code>git</code> via <code>brew uninstall git</code> and simply rely on <code>git</code> from Xcode, which seems to work just fine. (If anyone reading this knows what's up with my brew's git and can tell me how to fix it, ping me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/VladAIonescu">@vladaionescu</a>)</p>
<h2 id="usingdocker">Using Docker</h2>
<p>The Docker preview worked almost flawlessly for me from day 1. Making use of multi-platform images seems daunting at first, but really it's actually pretty simple.</p>
<p>The Docker for Mac app comes packed with <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> out of the box - so Docker is able to run either arm64 and amd64 images. Most official images are now supported on arm64 too. If you're building an image, by default it'll use your native architecture to execute the build (arm64) and most things will usually just work. Your mileage may vary, however, if you are <code>curl</code>ing some binary that may need to switch from <code>X86_64</code> to <code>aarch64</code> in its URL, or if you're doing lower-level stuff. I also noticed that some alpine packages are also not available for ARM (eg <code>shellcheck</code>).</p>
<p>The Docker team advise that QEMU is a best-effort approach and that it is best to run images natively as much as possible. I have encountered myself issues with some binaries when I tried to emulate them via QEMU. Here's a quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/thajeztah">Sebastiaan van Stijn</a>, member of the Moby Technical Steering Comitee (TSC).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-785013499"><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-10.58.33-AM.png" alt="We will continue looking to improve the emulation, and are also in talk with 🍏, but it will remain a &quot;best effort&quot;, and mostly to help the transition to ARM becoming more mainstream (both on hosting platforms, and in images). Because of the above, the recommendation is to run images that match the architecture."></a></p>
<p>Almost all of the official images are available for either platform. Third party ones are a mixed bag, with most of the community only offering amd64 versions. As a sample, the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka">Kafka community image</a> is amd64 only. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/redis">Redis image</a> is multi-platform. How can you tell? Go to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/redis/library/redis/latest/images/sha256-bca6e887ba6b58ed572cfecd7043eae16213fd537aa4a65facb9e70eed9c4964?context=explore">Docker Hub page for a tag (eg <code>latest</code>)</a> and look for this dropdown. If the dropdown exists, it means that it's a multi-platform image.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-1.15.36-PM.png" alt="Screenshot of Docker Hub tag page with multi-platform dropdown"></p><p>To build an image for a different architecture, you can use <code>docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 .</code> instead of the usual <code>docker build .</code>. For more details on building multi-platform images see <a href="https://medium.com/nttlabs/buildx-multiarch-2c6c2df00ca2">Akihiro Suda's blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker pull</code> an image from the registry, it will again default to your native architecture (if available), unless you specify <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker run</code> an image, it will default to whatever version of the image you have available locally or it will attempt to pull the arm64 version from the registry. You can also override the platform via <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code> if you'd like to run the amd64 version specifically.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img4.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' for different platforms"></p><p>Docker Compose will happily run a mixture of various architectures. The same rules apply with regards to pulling and running. You can also specify <code>platform: linux/amd64</code> for the service definition in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> if you'd like to be specific.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that Docker-in-Docker is not supported by QEMU (<a href="https://github.com/moby/qemu/pull/7">abandoned PR here</a>). So you cannot run an arm64 Docker in an amd64 Docker or vice-versa. <strong>However</strong>, if you run your natively-supported Docker-in-Docker, the inner Docker can still run multi-platform images fine.</p>
<p>Another issue that I noticed with the Docker preview on the M1 is that there are currently performance issues with multi-processor use - so much so that performance using a single core is sometimes slightly better than the performance of using 8 cores. Or at least that's what <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-772732443">@jasmas claims</a>. I've also seen some <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5389#issuecomment-785857638">benchmarks testing the import of a database like MySQL</a>, and it seems that there are some clear performance issues (~25X) with the Apple virtualization API. I've not seen such a drastic difference in common use, but hopefully these are addressed soon.</p>
<h2 id="usingvscode">Using VS Code</h2>
<p>Native support for Apple Silicon is not yet available in the generally available VS Code version, but running the amd64 emulated version works pretty well. You can also use the native version via a VS Code Universal build (contains both architectures in a single package) available via <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#osx">VS Code Insiders</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: The <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">latest stable version of VS Code</a> now includes the Mac Universal variant.</p>
<p>An issue I ran into with the amd64 version was that I did not realize that the terminal was also an amd64 process (Again, Rosetta 2 is just …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

                    <p>Did your last Yubikey just break? Perhaps you forgot an offline backup password. Maybe you're just tired of <a href="https://gist.github.com/grugq/03167bed45e774551155">living like a spy</a> and never using smartphones. Whatever it is, you're here, and you're finally ready to <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp">give up on PGP</a>. That's great!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gtank.cc/content/images/2019/02/225357.jpg"><figcaption>We're here to help!</figcaption></figure><p>No one was sending you encrypted emails anyway, so that's easy enough. But the most widespread uses of PGP are machine-oriented, for needs like package signing and local file encryption. I recently got into this again on a thread that mentioned <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30141">deprecating Go's OpenPGP package</a> and people always ask the same question: if not PGP, then what?</p><p>The thing is, there can't be a direct modern alternative to PGP. It's a do-everything design that predates modern cryptographic engineering and hasn't worked out well. The "modern alternative" is to use a much more specific and much less configurable solution to your problem.</p><p>Here are the most common uses of PGP and their modern, focused alternatives.</p><h2 id="signatures-for-os-or-package-updates">Signatures for OS or package updates</h2><p><strong>Original need:</strong> <a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-how-to-verify-ubuntu#0">Linux distributions</a> and many other software update mechanisms use PGP signatures to prevent malicious mirrors or network attackers from altering the contents of their packages.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative:</strong> a lightweight signing tool like OpenBSD's <a href="https://https.www.google.com.tedunangst.com/flak/post/signify">signify</a> or <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>, either of which you could quickly build in Go using <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519">x/crypto/ed25519</a>. I wrote one as a <a href="https://github.com/gtank/sshsign">party trick</a> last month – it's less than 200 lines of code and that includes some silly key parsing tricks.</p><p>These tools are extremely simple and robust because they only support one algorithm, lack state or any notion of a keyring, and are usually decoupled from complex messaging formats (which should be a separate concern from your signature cryptography). As a bonus they're mostly compatible with each other because the keys are all <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">EdDSA</a> keys. Need I even mention that EdDSA is much, much faster than RSA?</p><p>If you're a maintainer of self-serve packaging infrastructure or otherwise have more complex needs, you should take a look at <a href="https://theupdateframework.github.io/">TUF</a>. It's a modern toolkit meant to resist all kinds of update-related attacks that PGP signatures simply don't address. For an idea of how it works in practice, check out the designs for Python's package infrastructure (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/">PEP 458</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0480/">PEP 480</a>). The <a href="https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary">Notary project</a> is a productionized and audited implementation.</p><h2 id="encrypting-data-blobs">Encrypting data blobs</h2><p><strong>Original need: </strong>You want to store individual pieces of data without making their contents accessible to anyone else on your system. For some reason this isn't built into operating systems yet, so programs like <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> use PGP.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative: </strong><a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box">nacl/box</a> and <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox">nacl/secretbox</a>. These are general-purpose replacements for encrypting any kind of data. They support public-key and secret-key encryption, respectively, and both use secure modern modes and ciphers.</p><p><a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> made a very solid attempt to specify nacl in a storable message format with <a href="https://saltpack.org/">saltpack</a>, which has a good Go implementation using the above x/crypto package. It works as a nearly drop-in replacement anywhere you were using ASCII-armored PGP data.</p><h2 id="sending-files-securely">Sending files securely</h2><p><strong>Original need: </strong>You have files that you want to send to another person, but you don't want the data to be visible in transit or stored in the cloud. For this, folks often attach an encrypted ZIP file to an email.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative: </strong><a href="https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html">magic-wormhole</a>. If you need to send files to another person securely, use this. It's based on a modern cryptographic technique called <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/10/19/lets-talk-about-pake/">PAKE</a>, which basically means it keeps your data safe in transit while giving an attacker no chance to crack the password. It generates those passwords for you, and they're short, one-time-use combinations of three English words – all your recipient needs to do is enter the words. There's nothing to remember long-term and no account information to lose in a data breach. Wormhole also works through firewalls and optionally supports Tor.</p><p>We live in the future. There are better options than emailing encrypted files around.</p><h2 id="something-else">Something else?</h2><p>What's your lingering use case for PGP? Hit me up <a href="https://twitter.com/gtank__">on Twitter</a> or send me <a href="mailto:blog@gtank.cc?subject=I'm%20still%20using%20PGP">an email</a> and let's talk about getting you off PGP for good.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>February 2021</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/jessewilson">Jesse Wilson</a> once said to me:
          </p>
          <p>

“What if we could give customers a button. They’d press it at the end of the year and it would automagically file their taxes for them.”
</p>
<p>
At the time I thought the idea was appealing, but didn’t think much more about it. Today, I think this is the way TurboTax gets dismantled. It’s taking consumer finance companies with massive distribution, combining them with a tax preparation API and real-time visibility into users tax position. Tackling TurboTax head on is probably a waste of money. Tackling TurboTax asymmetrically has a real shot.
</p>

<h2>TurboTax is functionally a monopoly</h2>
<p>
From the outside looking in, TurboTax has a near impregnable moat. In taxes, there’s no clear second player with near the level of distribution, automation, community, trustworthiness, brand recognition and regulatory capture that they have. They’re incredible at playing regulatory defense by constantly and subtly opposing any government efforts to simplify taxes[1], which simultaneously makes their product more valuable and raises the bar for new entrants. Even the Justice Department recognizes TurboTax as a functional monopoly, and forced Intuit to sell CreditKarma Tax in order to complete the acquisition.[2]

They’re also strong at sniping competition early, before it becomes a serious threat. <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130808/a-techstars-first-startup-goodapril-gets-acquired-before-demo-day/">GoodApril</a> is an example; the company went through TechStars in 2013 and was focused on tax planning, initially for gig economy workers. Intuit acquired them before demo day, pre-empting their Series A.[3] 
</p>
<p>

More recently, from the outside looking in, you’d think they missed CreditKarma Tax by acquiring Credit Karma and selling the tax business to Cash App. I think more likely, CK gained scale before threatening Intuit by launching the tax product. The acquisition was at least valuable for a) securing CK’s distribution for TurboTax’s use and b) reducing the likelihood that a good competitor would emerge. You might bet that Cash App successfully executes on the transaction, but it’s at least not a guarantee, from Intuit’s perspective. 
</p><p>

TurboTax also owns the namespace for consumer taxes. Every year between January and April they become the top finance app and a top 10 app in the US Appstore. It’s possible someone builds a better direct to consumer product focused on tax prep, but I’m skeptical.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <img src="https://kunle.app/images/demand.png">
          </p>
        <p>
            All things considered, I think TurboTax is a fantastic business, and will be tough to compete with head on. It’s more likely that the following pieces come together to obviate TurboTax.
</p>
          <p>

Consumer finance distribution + tax prep API + differentiated tax planning (eg real-time tax computation)


        </p>
        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        
        <p>
Unseating TurboTax has been hard historically for a few reasons.
</p>

<h3>Superb distribution</h3>
<p>
As a startup, you have a 3.5 month window every year to acquire tax customers. During tax season, TurboTax already dominates the organic acquisition, Appstore rankings and paid acquisition channels. They’ve been doing it for years, they’re probably quite efficient, and you’re not going to outspend (or smartly out acquire) Turbotax from New Years day to tax day. [4]
</p>
      <div>
        
        <p><img src="https://kunle.app/images/appstore.jpeg">
        </p>
        
      </div>
            
          

<h3>Perception &amp; Quality</h3>
<p>
Doing taxes well for mainstream consumers is complicated, and the consequences of getting them wrong are both bewildering and material. Every year the tax code gets more complex. This benefits the player who already has internally encoded the complexity, and for whom additional complexity is incremental rather than absolute (starting from 0). Simply put, you have one shot to build customer trust, and if you get it wrong you really screw up the customer’s life. Why would any consumer take that risk? 
</p>
<p>

TurboTax has been doing your taxes for years, already has your previous filings, and will use them to prefill tons of fields for you. All the while, you’ve probably never been audited. It just works.
</p>

<h2>It’s time to build (tax prep software)</h2>
<p>
To defeat TurboTax, a lot of the ingredients exist already. They’re just in the process of being assembled.
</p>

<h3>Consumer Finance Distribution</h3>
<p>
To defeat Turbotax, you need consumer distribution that’s as good or better than what TurboTax has. Without this, they’ll outspend you on customer acquisition every tax season, long before you can make a dent. It helps to already have established consumer trust with an adjacent offering, because if the only benefit of your product is tax preparation, you’ll be forced to acquire customers during tax season and compete head on, and you’ll be outspent.
</p>
<p>
Today, multiple consumer finance products already have the distribution necessary to compete. These include products like Cash App, Chime, Venmo, Robinhood and others, which have wide ranging customer trust and customer bases in the tens of millions each. Crucially, these products acquire customers upstream of tax season - they provide financial services to consumers all year around. They also already have a partial picture into a customer’s financial life, and they’re already thinking about customers’ tax needs. Cash App has taken a first party approach (by buying Credit Karma Tax).
</p>
<div>
        
        <p><img src="https://kunle.app/images/robinhood.jpeg">
</p>
        
      </div>

<p>
 
Robinhood has taken a lead gen approach (by partnering with TurboTax). No one’s built on a tax API (because none currently exist). [5] For TurboTax this will be death by a thousand cuts - it will be years before a single player files more taxes than TurboTax. But the top 5 neobanks can drain enough volume to have a material impact.
</p>

<h3>Differentiated Tax Planning: Real time tax position</h3>
<p>
Turbotax is insanely focused on consumer tax needs during filing season. To date, this has been sufficient to win. Over the last 18 months, however, “new” things are possible around taxes that weren’t before. Today, high quality income and tax withholding data is available via API. With this data, you can compute your tax position in real time at any point in the year, which has two core financial benefits; a) you can know your tax liability at any point in the year with reasonable precision, and b) with that knowledge, you can optimize it. For instance, you could build a continuous W2 with Pinwheel’s <a href="https://docs.getpinwheel.com/docs/api/reference/pinwheel-api.v1.json/paths/~1accounts~1%7Baccount_id%7D~1paystubs/get">paystubs endpoint.</a>
</p>
<p>
This financial benefit wasn’t possible before the last couple of years, and it’s outside of TurboTax’s wheelhouse, because TurboTax optimizes and monetizes the tax transaction at year end, and essentially re-acquires taxpayers each season. Outside of tax season, I basically don’t log into TurboTax.
</p>
<p>
Over the last couple of years, several companies have emerged that provide programmatic, API based access to high quality income and wage data for consumers, including <a href="https://www.getpinwheel.com/">Pinwheel</a> (where I’m invested), <a href="https://argyle.com/">Argyle</a>, and <a href="https://atomic.financial/">Atomic</a>. I suspect <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/deposit-switch/">Plaid's deposit switch</a> team will eventually offer this as well.


Any consumer finance company can now provide a few foundational benefits to customers: 
</p><ul>
<li>Building the customer’s tax forms (eg W2 or 1099) continuously throughout the year using their payroll data</li>
<li>Providing the user a rolling, real-time view of their tax position (taxes owed, refunds) as they earn and spend throughout the year</li>
<li>Trust from the customer that you’re the right company to help file their taxes at year end. At year end - customers press a button, answer some qualifying questions, and electronically file the taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>
On top of these foundational benefits, there’s even more financial benefits that can be built. These are less straightforward, but no less valuable:
</p><ul>
<li><span>Tax refund factoring;</span> providing consumers access to refunds prior to tax season. There’s a bunch of regulatory complexity here and some fraud to account for, including users omitting crucial info to overstate their refunds. </li>
<li><span>Tax optimization;</span> recommending changes to income and spend behavior to improve year end tax liability positioning. This already happens a lot at the high end through concepts like tax loss harvesting and smb expense write offs; it’s just rarer for regular W2 and 1099 earners. In today’s world, by the time you’re logging into TurboTax, you’ve missed any shot at optimizing your tax position. Optimizations include amounts to save in tax advantaged accounts like HSA’s and 401Ks, tax allowances you’re eligible for, etc.</li>
<li><span>Spend categorization for tax purposes;</span> paired with an issued card, you can help categorize transactions and suggest which to save receipts for at year end. Mint and other PFMs focus on transaction categorization for budgeting; no one’s really focused on it for personal taxes. [6]</li>
<li><span>Advance capital gains optimisation;</span> tax loss harvesting tools exist, but with where rates are now there are interesting package strategies to allow customers finance instead of selling assets.[7] This starts with creating a live Schedule D and some scenario analysis tools which show customers their alternatives to getting cash today.</li>
</ul>


<p>
At its heart, this approach reaches the customer for a tax use case upstream of when TurboTax acquires them. This means a) you’re not competing at the time of year when TurboTax’s acquisition dollars will drown you, and b) you’re acquiring the customer mid-year, before taxes consume their attention. The best time to optimize your taxes are long before you have to pay them, and neobanks are well placed to provide this benefit.
</p>

<h2>What’s missing: tax preparation as an API</h2>
<p>
Today, there are lots of companies providing tax filing APIs, that would allow a tax preparer electronically file taxes that have already been prepared. From what I can see, no one’s building an API that manages the preparation of taxes. At a minimum you need a system that 
</p><ul>
<li>takes the various inputs (1099, W2 etc) and computes a tax position
asks a series of leading questions to learn more about the consumer (things like whether you’re married, head of household etc) to improve the tax …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>The Korean Stockholders’ Alliance is located in Yeouido, Seoul’s financial and political district, on the fifth floor of an officetel building mostly occupied by financial companies. Jung Eui-jung, the 62-year-old head of the Alliance and the sole resident of its office, points out the window to a large, bright-yellow bus parked outside on Eunhaengro (“bank street”), so named because it is home to South Korea’s two main state banks. The Alliance is an advocacy group that represents retail investors, with around 41,000 members. Its current mission statement is displayed in block letters on the side of the bus: “I hate short selling!”</p>



<p>Jung unveiled the bus at the end of January, not long after retail investors in the U.S. gathered on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets to drive up the share price of the video game retailer GameStop by 1,700% in a meme-fueled challenge to hedge funds who had shorted — in other words, bet against — the company’s stock. Helmed by a single driver, the Stockholders’ Alliance bus shuttles between Gwanghwamun, a public plaza often used for protests, and Yeouido, passing the stock exchange, financial regulators, and the National Assembly, in the hopes of igniting a similar movement in Korea.</p>



<p>Retail traders like Jung say that short selling is an exclusionary method of profiteering used by hedge funds to drive down stock prices and run roughshod over the little guys. That’s why the “David vs. Goliath” narrative surrounding GameStop has been so enthusiastically received by small investors in South Korea, who are known locally as “ants” — a nickname that captures their underdog identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not a lot of people really knew what short selling was,” said Jung, who founded the Alliance in 2019. “But the GameStop incident provided the spark of curiosity and awakened the public to the problem.”</p>



<p>As the story made local headlines, it stirred talk of a Korean copycat movement online. On Naver Cafe, the South Korean equivalent of Reddit, Jung later named the Alliance’s anti-short-selling campaign “kstreetbets.” The forum is where most of the group’s organizing — planning protests, petitioning regulators, and writing letters to lawmakers — is done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As South Korea undergoes a <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/979164.html">retail trading boom</a> during the pandemic that has sent the country’s benchmark KOSPI index to record highs, this sort of activism has turned ants into a symbol of “<a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/982101.html">economic democratization</a>” and an unlikely political force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pressure from retail traders like Jung pushed the government to extend a temporary ban on short selling, which was initially imposed in March of 2020. Now, with the current ban set to expire in May, Jung is campaigning for an additional <a href="https://www.chosun.com/economy/2021/02/02/L67EV46KXBGGDEWOIAGAPSI2EU/">year-long extension</a>, if not an outright abolition of the practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>South Koreans have historically tended to steer clear of stocks, preferring to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/04/03/2020040302464.html%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259A%2525B0%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%25259D%2525BC%2525EC%252597%252590%2525EC%252584%25259C%252520%2525EA%2525B0%252580%2525EA%2525B5%2525AC%2525EB%25258B%2525B9%252520%2525EB%2525B6%252580%2525EB%25258F%252599%2525EC%252582%2525B0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EC%252582%2525B0,%2525EC%25258B%2525AC%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%25258F%252584%252520%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%2525B9%2525A0%2525EC%2525A7%252580%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">invest in real estate</a>. Recently, however, government curbs on property investments, stagnant wages, low interest rates, and high property prices have left people searching for a quicker buck. Jung estimated that the number of active ants has increased from <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html">6 million to 10 million</a> over the past year alone.</p>



<p>Much of that increase has been among <a href="https://investpension.miraeasset.com/contents/view.do?idx=12857">millennials</a> — known as the “2030 generation” — who are <a href="http://economy.chosun.com/client/news/view.php?boardName=C03&amp;page=3&amp;t_num=13609701">approaching stocks</a> with a generational pessimism, embodied in <a href="https://imnews.imbc.com/news/2021/society/article/6076397_34873.html">terms like <em>yeoung-ggeul</em></a><em> </em>(a Korean portmanteau that translates to “scraping together your soul to invest”) and <em>bittu</em> (taking out debt to invest). <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">Shunning conventional long-term investment vehicles</a> like index trackers or exchange-traded funds, they <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html%2523:~:text=%2525EA%2525B1%2525B0%2525EB%25259E%252598%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25259D%252580%25252065.8%252525%2525EB%2525A1%25259C,%2525EB%2525B0%2525A9%2525EC%25258B%25259D%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B0%2525B8%2525EC%252597%2525AC%2525ED%252595%252598%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">have</a> preferred to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">buy and sell their stocks directly</a>, seeking mid-to-high returns. For many, according to one <a href="https://investpension.miraeasset.com/contents/view.do?idx=12857">poll</a>, stocks <a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/1Z5HQ1TAEZ">represent</a> a ticket to home ownership.</p>

<p>Technology has also lowered the barrier to entry since Jung began investing in stocks as a salaryman bank worker in the mid-1990s. The new wave of retail investors tends to gravitate toward easy-to-use <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/a-retail-trading-army-has-been-roiling-korean-stocks-for-months">brokerage apps</a> with low commissions and to finding trading strategies and tips online. “Back in the day, you’d study by reading books about stocks, but now the overwhelming trend is watching YouTube videos, especially for the 2030 generation,” Jung said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That has brought its own perils. YouTube can be a valuable resource for the wise, but a minefield of fraudulent advice for the gullible. In legally ambiguous KakaoTalk or Telegram group chats known as “<a href="http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/48901.html">leading rooms</a>,” anonymous stock tipsters (“leaders”) sweet-talk credulous ants with promises of windfall profits before bilking them. Some leaders <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/stock/view/2021/01/39881/">turn out to be running pump-and-dump schemes</a>. Or “they’ll pull tricks like pretending to be offering a free service before directing you to a room with a subscription fee,” said Jung, who noted that he has reported some of the chat rooms to financial regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jung is also concerned by what financial experts have <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/03/06/2017030603181.html">cautioned</a> is the tendency of ants to go after risky, short-term bets. “South Korea might have one of the highest literacy rates in the world, but our level of financial literacy is very poor,” said Jung. “Ants do a lot of quick-hit trading — selling when prices rise a little but also when prices drop just slightly.” One popular <a href="https://news.joins.com/article/23875703">rule of thumb</a> for young ants has been “hitting five,” or cashing out whenever you reach a 5% return or make $45 (50,000 won) in profit. Many have also turned to margin trading, essentially borrowing money to buy stocks, which has recently become <a href="https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0102_202101181804220081">more popular</a> than ever. With the Korean stock market <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228425122_Why_are_Korean_markets_so_volatile">notoriously volatile</a>, investors can easily end up losing more than they put in.</p>



<p>But when the ants work together, they can move markets. Last March, foreign and institutional investors, worried about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, sold off a combined $46 billion (50 trillion won) of the benchmark KOSPI, pushing the market down to a dismal 1,457.64 points. <a href="http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/977810.html">Ants countered</a>, buying $43.58 billion (47.4 trillion won), propelling the KOSPI index over the 3,000 mark for the first time in history, in January of this year. The feat has been named the <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/976027.html">Donghak Ant Movement</a>, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Donghak Peasant Revolution, an 1894 uprising of farmers against corrupt government officials and economic destabilization at the hands of foreign powers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players. Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The stock market index has historically fallen before rebounding in times of crisis, and it seems like retail investors anticipated this scenario this time,” said Kim So-young, a finance professor at Seoul National University. “Once it became apparent that a lot of them were holding the line, more piled on, causing the surge.”</p>



<p>The ants’ ability to collectively flex their power has given them <a href="https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=5090525">undeniable political leverage</a>. In late 2020, the Alliance <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/11/03/2020110302008.html">successfully rallied against a government proposal</a> to expand capital gains taxes on stock investments for the top 5% of retail investors. Since December 2020, over 200,000 people have signed a <a href="https://www1.president.go.kr/petitions/595214">presidential petition</a> calling for the abolition of short selling, meeting the requirement for an official response from the government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proponents of short selling argue that it functions as a kind of safety valve for the stock market. By allowing investors to bet in both directions, the practice skims the fat off overvalued stocks and keeps the market efficient. But “the problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players,” said Jung. “Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p>



<p>Short selling comprises only about 4% of total trades in South Korea, compared to around 40% in other major markets, but the point, according to Jung, is the inequality. “The dynamic is always one side disproportionately profiting, while retail investors are losing,” said Jung. “That’s what needs to change.”</p>



<p>Shorting a stock requires first borrowing the shares, which you then later buy back at a lower price to make a profit. Individual investors <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210113116200502%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EB%2525B3%2525B8%2525EC%25258B%25259C%2525EC%25259E%2525A5%2525EB%2525B2%252595%252520180%2525EC%2525A1%2525B0%2525EB%25258A%252594,%2525EB%2525B6%252588%2525EB%2525B2%252595%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B7%2525A8%2525EA%2525B8%252589%2525EB%252590%252598%2525EB%25258A%252594%252520%2525EA%2525B2%252583%2525EC%25259D%2525B4%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">face high collateral rates and fees</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/ko-kr/money/markets/%2525EA%2525B3%2525B5%2525EB%2525A7%2525A4%2525EB%25258F%252584%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25258B%2525AC-%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525ED%252585%25258C%2525EC%25259D%2525BC%2525ED%252592%252580%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EB%2525B0%252580/ar-BB1cDqVv">limited selections</a> of shares, and a repayment period capped at 60 days. Foreign investors and institutions, on the other hand, have no fixed repayment deadline — although lenders can technically recall their shares at any time. Moreover, capital gains from short selling are untaxed. Consequently, <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/economy/view/2019/12/1054426/">just 1%</a> of short sellers in South Korea are small investors.</p>



<p>Retail investors, particularly those trading on margins, are also uniquely vulnerable to market volatility, which short selling can amplify — particularly in small stocks that are already sensitive to large movements. “There is definitely an aspect of short selling that stokes volatility,” said Kim So-young, the finance professor. “For stock that might not fall as dramatically if it weren’t being shorted, a short sell can exacerbate the decline.”</p>



<p>This has heightened the sense among ants that big institutional and foreign investors can use short selling to siphon money from retail traders. A <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/17/2021011700419.html">recently published study</a> by researchers at Hanyang University found that short sellers in Korea <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/short-sellers-under-siege-everywhere-have-it-really-bad-in-korea">averaged about $2 million in daily profits</a> from 2016 to 2019, while investors who traded on margin lost an average of $900,000 per day. “The rule here is that the money flows out from the wallets of individual investors to short sellers,” Jung said. “It’s a staggering gap.”</p>



<p>Although short selling alone is unlikely to cause the index to plummet, some analysts worry that the market is approaching a bubble and that <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210203165200004">overleveraged new ants</a> could soon find themselves in trouble.</p>



<p>Jung said that authorities should use this moment to put in place protections and education for retail investors so that they can better handle volatility. He is also studying the fallout from the r/WallStreetBets incident. Many retail investors lost out as GameStop shares slumped again after the rush was over.</p>

<p>Django 3.2 is just around the corner and it's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.2/" rel="noopener">packed with new features</a>. Django versions are usually not that exciting (it's a good thing!), but this time many features were added to the ORM, so I find it especially interesting!</p>
<p><strong>This is a list of my favorite features in Django 3.2</strong></p>

<p>To install the latest version of Django you can either install using <code>pip</code>, or if it hasn't been released yet, install directly from git:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> pip install git+https://github.com/django/django@3.2a1
</pre></div>


<p>Start a new project and app:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> django-admin startproject project
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py startapp store
</pre></div>


<p>Add the new app to the list of <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>, and configure a PostgreSQL database:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># settings.py</span>

<span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>

<p>Congratulations! You now have 10K new customers, you are ready to go!</p>

<h2 id="covering-indexes"><a href="#covering-indexes">Covering Indexes</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30913" rel="noopener">Ticket #30913</a></p>
<p>Covering indexes let you store additional columns in an index. The main benefit of a covering index is that when a query only uses fields that are present in the index, the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">database can use an index-only scan</a>, meaning the actual table is not accessed at all. This can make queries faster.</p>
<p>Django 3.2 added support for PostgreSQL covering indexes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Index.include and UniqueConstraint.include attributes allow creating covering indexes and covering unique constraints on PostgreSQL 11+.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If for example you are searching for names of customers that have joined during a certain period of time, you can create an index on <code>joined_at</code>, and include the field <code>name</code> in the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>class</span> <span>Meta</span><span>:</span>
        <span>indexes</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
            <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Index</span><span>(</span>
                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>%(app_label)s</span><span>_</span><span>%(class)s</span><span>_joined_at_ix'</span><span>,</span>
<span>                <span>fields</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,),</span>
</span><span>                <span>include</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,),</span>
</span>            <span>),</span>
        <span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>include</code> arguments makes this a covering index.</p>
<p>For queries that only use the fields <code>joined_at</code> and <code>name</code>, the database will be able to satisfy queries using just the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>print</span><span>(</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at__lt</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>.</span><span>localize</span><span>(</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>(</span><span>2021</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>values_list</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>)</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>explain</span><span>()</span>
<span>... </span><span>)</span>

<span><span>Index Only Scan using store_customer_joined_at_ix on store_customer</span>
</span><span>  Index Cond: (joined_at &lt; '2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'::timestamp with time zone)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The query above finds names of customers that joined before February 2021. According to the execution plan, the database was able to satisfy the query using just the index, without even accessing the table. This is called an "index only scan".</p>
<p>Index only scans can be a bit confusing at first. As described in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">official documentation of PostgreSQL</a>, it might take some time before PostgreSQL can actually use <em>just</em> the index:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there is an additional requirement for any table scan in PostgreSQL: it must verify that each retrieved row be “visible” to the query's MVCC snapshot [...]. Visibility information is not stored in index entries, only in heap entries; so at first glance it would seem that every row retrieval would require a heap access anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to check if a table page can be viewed by the current transaction is to check the table's visibility map, which is significantly smaller and faster to access than the table itself. It may take some time for PostgreSQL to update the visibility map, so until then you might see an execution plan like this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Bitmap</span> <span>Heap</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>27.07..117.02</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>16</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Recheck</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>Bitmap</span> <span>Index</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer_joined_at_ix</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>0.00..26.86</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
        <span>Index</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To check if your index can really be used for index only scans, you can speed up the process by manually issuing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html" rel="noopener">vacuum analyze</a> on the table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>VACUUM</span> <span>ANALYZE</span> <span>store_customer</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Executing <code>VACUUM</code> will also <a href="https://hakibenita.com/postgresql-unused-index-size#index-and-table-bloat">reclaim some unused space</a> and make it available for re-use.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE 2020-03-04</em>: I originally suggested using <code>VACUUM FULL</code> instead of plain <code>VACUUM</code>. <a href="https://twitter.com/Adrien_nayrat/status/1367153917239427078?s=20" rel="noopener">A commenter on twitter</a> mentioned that using <code>VACUUM</code> will be sufficient for this purpose, and will be much less intrusive and disruptive, so use that instead!</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that inclusive indexes are not free. Additional fields in the index will make the index bigger.</p>

<h2 id="provide-timezone-to-truncdate"><a href="#provide-timezone-to-truncdate">Provide Timezone to TruncDate</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31948" rel="noopener">Ticket #31948</a></p>
<p>I write a lot about <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts">mistakes in SQL</a> and timezones are usually at the top of the list. One of the most dangerous mistakes when working with timestamps is <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts#be-aware-of-timezones">truncating without explicitly specifying a timezone</a>, which can lead to incorrect and inconsistent results.</p>
<p>In Django 3.2 it becomes easier to avoid this mistake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new tzinfo parameter of the TruncDate and TruncTime database functions allows truncating datetimes in a specific timezone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In previous Django versions, the timezone was set internally according to the current timezone:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># django/db/models/functions/datetime.py</span>
<span>tzname</span> <span>=</span> <span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>get_current_timezone_name</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>settings</span><span>.</span><span>USE_TZ</span> <span>else</span> <span>None</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As of Django 3.2, you can explicitly provide a timezone to the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/database-functions/#django.db.models.functions.TruncDate" rel="noopener"><code>TruncDate</code></a> functions family:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pytz</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>TruncDay</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>

</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>timezone</span><span>(</span><span>'America/New_York'</span><span>)))</span>
</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC(</span>
<span>#     'day',</span>
<span>#     "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'</span>
<span># ) AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A step in the right direction!</p>

<h2 id="building-json-objects"><a href="#building-json-objects">Building JSON Objects</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32179" rel="noopener">Ticket #32179</a></p>
<p>Building JSON objects in PostgreSQL is very handy, especially if you are working with unstructured data.</p>
<p>As of Django 3.2, the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>json_build_object</code> from PostgreSQL</a> that accepts arbitrary key-value pairs was added to the ORM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Added the JSONObject database function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One interesting use case is serializing objects directly in the DB, bypassing the need to create ORM objects:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models</span> <span>import</span> <span>F</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>JSONObject</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>=</span><span>JSONObject</span><span>(</span>
    <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>F</span><span>(</span><span>'id'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>F</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>),</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>values_list</span><span>(</span><span>'obj'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>first</span><span>()</span>

<span>({</span>
    <span>'id'</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>'Haki Benita'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>:</span> <span>'2021-04-25T00:00:00'</span><span>,</span>
<span>},)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We already showed how crucial <a href="https://hakibenita.com/django-rest-framework-slow">serialization performance</a> can be, so this is something to consider.</p>

<h2 id="loud-signal-receiver"><a href="#loud-signal-receiver">Loud Signal Receiver</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32261" rel="noopener">Ticket #32261</a></p>
<p>A while back I <a href="https://twitter.com/be_haki/status/1335921247306264579?s=20" rel="noopener">twitted about a mysterious bug</a> I had that went unnoticed for a long time because it happened inside a signal receiver.</p>
<p>When you use <code>send_robust</code> to broadcast signals, if the signal fails, Django keeps the error and moves on to the next receiver. After all of the receivers processed the signal, Django returns a list with the receivers' return values and exceptions. To check if any of the receivers failed, you need to go over the list and check for instances of <code>Exception</code>. Signals are often used to decouple modules, and handing exceptions from receivers this way defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>To make sure I don't miss exceptions in signal receivers again, I created a "loud signal receiver" that logs exceptions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.dispatch</span> <span>import</span> <span>receiver</span>

<span>def</span> <span>loud_receiver</span><span>(</span><span>signal</span><span>,</span> <span>logger</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Subscribe to Django signal and log errors from the receiver function.</span>

<span>    When using `send_robust` to send Django Signals, errors happening in the</span>
<span>    receivers are kept and returned. Because signals are mostly used for decoupling</span>
<span>    modules, the return value from `send_robust` is often dismissed.</span>
<span>    To make it easier not to miss errors from Django signal receivers, use this decorator</span>
<span>    instead to log the exceptions to a specific logger.</span>

<span>    NOTE: Not necessary as of Django 3.2</span>

<span>    Example:</span>
<span>        logger = logging.getLogger('some.logger')</span>
<span>        @loud_receiver(signals.SomeSignal, logger=logger, dispatch_uid='uid')</span>
<span>        def receiver_func():</span>
<span>            pass</span>
<span>    """</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>_decorator</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>):</span>
        <span>def</span> <span>loud_func</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func_args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>func_kwargs</span><span>):</span>
            <span>try</span><span>:</span>

            <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
                <span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>exception</span><span>(</span><span>'exception from signal receiver'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>raise</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>receiver</span><span>(</span><span>signal</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)(</span><span>loud_func</span><span>)</span>

Yet the discussion feels incomplete — I have not been able to put into words all that I want to say. Thus, at the risk of once again revealing my <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/01/31/confession-i-am-not-good-at-math/">mathematical ignorance</a>, I am going to try another response to Keith Devlin’s <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_06_08.html">multiplication</a> <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_0708_08.html">articles</a>.</p>
<p>Let me state up front that I speak as a teacher, not as a mathematician. I am not qualified, nor do I intend, to argue about the implications of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeanosAxioms.html">Peano’s Axioms</a>. My experience lies primarily in teaching K-10, from elementary arithmetic through basic algebra and geometry. I remember only snippets of my college math classes, back in the days when we worried more about nuclear winter than global warming.</p>
<p>I will start with a few things we can all agree on…</p>

<h2>We All Agree on Some Things</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elementary students will use addition</strong> to solve beginning multiplication problems. What else could they do? They have not yet learned multiplication.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The multiplication table is initially built by repeated addition</strong>, as our students add up (or count by) the numbers in each row and column. Even adults, when they get stumped by a math fact they’ve forgotten, will use repeated addition to figure out the answer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repeated addition does give the correct answer</strong> for any multiplication of whole numbers. Sometimes it is more trouble than it is worth — who wants to add up 957×842? But by using the Distributive Property, any multiplication of whole numbers can be reduced to a repeated addition calculation:<br>
4 ×&nbsp;3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) ×&nbsp;3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rational number multiplications can be calculated as addition of parts.</strong> This is how the Egyptian scribes handled multiplication of fractions. But be careful! To calculate the parts, one needs multiplication — or rather, its inverse, division. So to use this as a definition, one must resort to circular reasoning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finally, I think we can all agree that repeated addition is an important problem-solving tool.</strong> Repeated addition can help students think their way through simple multiplication word problems. It doesn’t always work, but sometimes it is the quickest way to understand a situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So What’s the Problem?</h2>
<p>So what is wrong with the definition, “Multiplication is repeated addition”? Perhaps <em>wrong</em> is too strong a word — perhaps in some deep, theoretical sense, the statement is true, at least for the whole numbers — I’ll leave that argument to the mathematicians. (See, for instance, <a href="http://devlinsangle.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-multiplication-is-really-defined-in.html" title="How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic">How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic</a>.) But speaking as a teacher, the phrase can definitely be misleading.</p>
<blockquote><p>To define multiplication as repeated addition is to make multiplication a sub-species of addition.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is as if there were two types of addition: regular, random, “wild” addition and the specially-bred variety of addition to which we give the name <em>multiplication</em>. Is that really how we want our students to think? Multiplication is not a mere sub-species of addition. Multiplication is its own animal, an independent operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The operation of addition has its <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/identity-element">identity element</a>. </li>
<li>The operation of multiplication has its <a href="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56032.html">identity element</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Every number has its own <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/a/additive_inverse_number.htm">additive inverse</a>. </li>
<li>Each number has a <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/m/multiplicative_inverse_of_a_number.htm">multiplicative inverse</a>, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Addition has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34bx2.htm">subtraction</a>.</li>
<li>Multiplication has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34cx2.htm">division</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same, because the operations are not the same.</p>
<p>[Sidetrack: Oops! I forgot that zero does not have a multiplicative inverse. <a href="http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7002833&amp;tstart=0">Jonathan</a> pointed out my mistake.]</p>
<p>[Another side note: I find it interesting that repeated subtraction can be a useful tool in solving some division problems, just as repeated addition can be a useful tool in understanding multiplication. Subtraction plays an important role in the <a href="https://denisegaskins.com/2010/04/12/the-cookie-factory-guide-to-long-division/">algorithm for long division</a>. I suppose someone will argue that this is evidence multiplication is repeated addition after all.]</p>
<h2>Dimensional Reasoning</h2>
<p><a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Dimensional+analysis">Dimensional analysis</a> means looking at the dimensions (units of measurement) of a quantity to help you solve a science or engineering problem.</p>
<p><strong>Addition requires identical units.</strong> The sum must always have the same units as the addends:</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 apples = 5 apples</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges = ?? </p>
<p>What does that second equation give you? Fruit salad? In order to add quantities with unlike units, we need to find a <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/common+denominator">common denominator</a>. Apples and oranges are both pieces of fruit, so…</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges =</p>
<p>2 pieces of fruit + 3 pieces of fruit = 5 pieces of fruit </p>
<p><strong>Multiplication requires different units.</strong> The product does not have the same units as either the multiplier or the multiplicand.</p>
<p>2 baskets ×&nbsp;3 apples per basket  = 6 apples </p>
<p>How can we make multiplication come out the same as repeated addition? The only way to do it is to change the units.</p>
<p>3 cm + 3 cm = 6 cm </p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>2 cm ×&nbsp;3 cm = 6 cm<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p>We need…</p>
<p>2 lengths ×&nbsp;3 cm per length = 6 cm</p>
<p>We do not normally think about dimensional analysis when we work with plain numbers in math class. But the fact remains that <em>multiplication changes things in a way that addition does not</em>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Addition is one-dimensional, but multiplication is multi-dimensional.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why the rules for fraction addition and fraction multiplication are so different. When you add positive rational numbers, you always get a sum that is bigger than either addend. But when you multiply rational numbers, all bets are off — the product may be bigger, smaller, or somewhere in between the numbers.</p>
<h2>Language Does Matter</h2>
<p><strong>Addition:</strong> addend + addend = sum. The addends are interchangeable. This is represented by the fact that they have the same name.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplication:</strong> multiplier ×&nbsp;multiplicand = product. The multiplier and multiplicand have different names, even though many of us have trouble remembering which is which. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiplier</strong> = “how many or how much”</li>
<li><strong>multiplicand</strong> = the size of the “unit” or “group”</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Different names indicate a difference in function.</em> The multiplier and the multiplicand are not conceptually interchangeable. It is true that multiplication is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Commutative.html">commutative</a>, but (2&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;3&nbsp;chairs/row) is not the same as (3&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;2&nbsp;chairs/row), even though both sets contain 6&nbsp;chairs.</p>
<h2>A New Type of Number</h2>
<p>In multiplication, we introduce a totally new type of number: the <em>multiplicand.</em> A strange, new concept sits at the heart of multiplication, something students have never seen before.</p>
<p>The multiplicand is a this-per-that ratio.</p>
<p>A ratio is a not a counting number, but something new, much more abstract than anything the students have seen up to this point. </p>
<p>A ratio is a relationship number.</p>
<p>In addition and subtraction, numbers count how much stuff you have. If you get more stuff, the numbers get bigger. If you lose some of the stuff, the numbers get smaller. Numbers measure the amount of cookies, horses, dollars, gasoline, or whatever.</p>
<p>The multiplicand doesn’t count the number of dollars or measure the volume of gasoline. It tells the relationship between them, the dollars per gallon, which <em>stays the same whether you buy a lot or a little.</em> </p>
<blockquote><p>By telling our students that “multiplication is repeated addition,” we dismiss the importance of the multiplicand. But until our students wrestle with and come to understand the concept of ratio, they can never fully understand multiplication.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How Then Shall We Teach?</h2>
<p>If we accept this argument, if we agree to no longer define basic multiplication as repeated addition, then what? How does that affect the way we teach?</p>
<p>Mainly, we need to change our focus from <strong>how</strong> to <strong>why</strong>.</p>
<p>We can teach multiplication in much the same way that we do now, using manipulatives arranged in groups or rows, pictures of multiplication situations, and rectangular arrays of dots or blocks. But instead of drawing our student’s attention to the <em>process</em> of adding up the answer, we want to focus on the fact that the items are arranged in <em>equal sized groups</em>. </p>
<p>In other words, we teach our students to recognize the multiplicand: </p>
<ul>
<li>Teach children the useful word “per” and how to recognize a “this per that” unit. </li>
<li>Have them label the quantities in their workbook: 3 cookies per student, 5 flowers per vase, 1 eye per alien, or whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we need a simple, elementary-level catchphrase to replace “multiplication is repeated addition,” how about this? </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Multiplication is counting by this-per-that groups.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As with any such phrase, this statement fails to capture all that multiplication entails. The definition will have to be expanded as students learn about rational numbers. “Oh, look! We can count just part of a group, and we can measure with a unit that is not a whole number.” Our students will someday have to learn about real numbers, complex numbers, and matrix multiplication. Even so, the phrase captures an important aspect of many multiplication situations our students will meet in K-12: that there is a multiplicand, some “this per that” quantity.</p>
<p>This approach should be especially helpful to those frustrating students — you know, the ones with the blank stare — who read a word problem and then ask, “Do I add or multiply?”</p>
<h2>A Useful Tool</h2>
<p>Completing the circle, I come back to the point of <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2008/07/01/if-it-aint-repeated-addition/">my first “repeated addition” post</a>. I would like you to consider the teaching power of bar model diagrams to represent arithmetic operations. These diagrams are used in the <a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39.htm">Singapore Primary Math</a> books, and according to <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/09/02/pre-algebra-problem-solving-2nd-grade/#comment-12305">one commenter</a> they are popular in Russia and Australia. They are even beginning to show up in newer American textbooks, where they are sometimes called “tape diagrams.” </p>
<p>Here are some advantages of the bar diagram model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar diagrams chunkify the number line and make number relationships less abstract. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They provide elementary students with a pictorial algebra that can help them think through complicated word problems. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is easy for students to see the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction, or between multiplication and division. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>What you see above is a tool to reorder the pages of a PDF file, into the order as described by Brent Yorgey <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> (called “Möbius double-sided printing” <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>). Basically, it reorders the <i>n</i> pages [1, 2, …, <i>n</i>] of a PDF file into the order [1, <i>m</i>+1, 2, <i>m</i>+2, 3, <i>m</i>+3, … <i>m</i>, 2<i>m</i>], where <i>m</i> = ⌈<i>n</i>/2⌉, and the final page 2<i>m</i> is omitted if it doesn't exist (i.e., if <i>n</i> is odd).</p>

<p>To use this tool, just upload a PDF file above, then click on the link to download a new PDF file with reordered pages.</p>


<p><i>(In short, so that it requires less mental effort to turn pages, and so that it's easier to look at the next/previous page(s) simultaneously. It's explained by Brent Yorgey on the two pages mentioned above; reproducing part of the explanation here along with his illustrations.)</i></p>

<p>Consider the standard/default method of two-sided printing: for a document with 8 pages, the result looks like:</p>

What you do is always the same, namely flip the current sheet of paper and move it to the bottom of the stack:</p>

    <li>When the text refers to the previous or the next page, you can always very easily look at that page or put it adjacent to the current one (so you can see both at once), which with the standard method is impossible when an odd-numbered page refers to its next page or an even-numbered page refers to its previous one. Also, if you just want to glance at the previous page, there is never any page flipping required: just twist your wrist and look at the bottom of the stack. (This is my main reason for preferring this method over the minor variant he calls “Two-way double-sided”.)</li>

<p>The code rearranges pages using <a href="https://pdf-lib.js.org/">pdf-lib</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib">GitHub</a>) (v1.3.0) by Andrew Dillon. I tried to use Mozilla's PDF.js, but its documentation on these “core” matters (as opposed to just rendering a PDF in a canvas or whatever) seems poor/nonexistent compared to pdf-lib, which is excellent.</p>

<p>The idea of printing documents in this way, and the analysis and pictures above, are due to Brent Yorgey (<a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> and <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>, as mentioned).</p>

<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>

<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>

<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>

<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt (though not as high as in the Nordic countries). The share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

<p>Why simple rules of thumb often outperform complex models</p>

</div><div>

<p>This is the age of big data. We are constantly in quest of more numbers and more complex algorithms to crunch them. We seem to believe that this will solve most of the world’s problems - in economy, society and even our personal lives. As a corollary, rules of thumb and gut instincts are getting a short shrift. We think they often violate the principles of logic and lead us into making bad decisions. We might have had to depend on heuristics and our gut feelings in agricultural and manufacturing era. But this is digital age. We can optimise everything.</p>

<p>Can we?</p>

<p>Gerd Gigerenzer, a sixty nine year German psychologist who has been studying how humans make decisions for most of his career, doesn't think so. In the real world, rules of thumb not only work well, they also perform better than complex models, he says. We shouldn’t turn our noses up on heuristics, we should embrace them.</p>

<p>That view is increasingly gaining global attention. Partly because of the failure of complex models in predicting major events, such as the financial crisis in 2008, and the election of Donald Trump last year. Partly because Gigerenzer is backing what he says with some cutting edge research. His team at The Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin studies the role of heuristics in decision making, in a way that can be coded into a computer programme, tested, and used in the real world. In finance, Bank of England is using their insights to design simpler rules to avert banking crisis. In healthcare, medical organisations are working with them to teach risk literacy to doctors and patients so they can evaluate evidence better. Artificial intelligence developers are looking up at their work to see if they can make machines think better.</p>

<h3>An adaptive toolbox&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer was in India recently to conduct a seminar, called the Winter School on Bounded Rationality at TA Pai Management Institute, Manipal, where his audience were a skeptical bunch of research scholars from some of the top institutions in India and abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gigerenzer, a tall man sporting a white mustache and possessing the gait of a country gentleman, was in full flow - explaining, clarifying, defending his worldview using a mix of evidence from research, personal anecdotes and a deadpan display of academic confidence. When a finance professor with an obvious love for mathematical analysis said he didn’t agree with Gigerenzer’s views, he replied, “Well, I have three days to convince you”.</p>

<p>In short, Gigerenzer's arguments go like this. There is a big difference between risk and uncertainty. You are dealing with <em>risk</em> when you know all the alternatives, outcomes and their probabilities. You are dealing with <em>uncertainty</em> when you don’t know all the alternatives, outcomes or their probabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are dealing with risk, complex mathematical models and fine tuning them for optimisation work. However, when you are dealing with uncertainty, they don’t work well, because the world is dynamic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you then need is a set of simple rules of thumb that are robust and gut instincts sharpened by years of experience. You need <em>an adaptive toolbox</em>. To use the toolbox well, logical rationality - knowing rules such as transitivity and set theorem - won’t suffice. What’s needed is <em>ecological rationality</em>, that is knowing which heuristic works in which environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Innovating over a cup of coffee</h3>

<p>To study all of these, Gigerenzer has assembled a team of international and interdisciplinary team in ABC at&nbsp;Max Planck Institute. “I don’t believe in the borders of the regular disciplines”, Gigerenzer said. “They may be good for teaching but certainly not for innovation. My group has about 35 researchers and half of them, at any point, are from ten different disciplines - psychology, machine learning, computers, economics, engineering, philosophy, biology and so on. The point is to get all these minds together to solve one problem.”</p>

<p>That problem is: <em>How do humans and other animals make decisions under uncertainty, that is, when time and information are limited and the future is unknown? &nbsp;</em>They try to solve this problem by designing models of how people make decisions, and by&nbsp;conducting experiments, testing one model against another to see where rules of thumb (heuristics)&nbsp;perform better than others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Another important thing,” he continued, “is to make them feel like a family, because people from different disciplines typically avoid talking to one another. They claim no one would understand their language. At Max Planck I have put them all on one floor. We have tea and coffee everyday at 4 PM. No one is obligated to come, so they come. And they talk, they ask questions: “What does this concept mean?,” “Why don’t you do that instead of this”. And, so we make progress.”</p>

<p>“It is one of the most intellectually stimulating environments for research,” Özgür Simsek, a researcher in Gigerenzer’s team said. Simsek studied industrial engineering in Turkey, before moving to University of Massachusetts, Amherst to get a masters in operations research and a PhD in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After her doctorate, she was looking for something novel to work on, and found the research on bounded rationality at Max Planck to be interesting. “I thought the research on bounded rationality had perhaps something new to say about AI and machine learning, and perhaps we could bring some of these ideas into AI. At the same time, I thought my computational background, working in algorithms, analyzing algorithms, developing algorithms could be useful in understanding heuristics better,” Simsek said. It is eight years since she joined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path that Konstantinos Katsikopoulos took to land in Max Planck Institute was not too different. He studied in Athens, and then went on to get his PhD in operations research from MIT. He came to know about Gigerenzer’s work when he stumbled on a book title “Simple Heuristics that Make Us Smart.” The was intrigued by the words simple and smart.&nbsp;He already knew the limitations of complex optimising models. “When I studied mathematics, the most basic thing I learned is that any claims about optimality or optimising are conditional on the model. Your results are always the best according to a model of the world. And a model of the world is not reality. You can’t take the model per se as a benchmark of success in the world.” The idea of comparing complex optimisation models against simple heuristics appealed to him. He joined Max Planck as a postdoc fifteen years ago. Katsikopoulos recently shifted to the Business School of the University of Southampton, UK, and continues to be associated with Max Planck through Harding Center for Risk Literacy as an adjunct scientist. (Harding Center, a part of Max Planck&nbsp;trains physicians and patients to better understand medical evidence, and promotes risk literacy among school children. Gigerenzer is not a fan of the Nudge (using insights behavioural economics and psychology to change behaviour of people by subtle cues and changes in a setting). He believes teaching people how to assess risks is a more straightforward and effective way to get positive results).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another researcher, Shenghua Luan, was doing his PhD in psychology at University of Florida, after graduating from Peking University in China. At Florida, he attended a seminar in which Gigerenzer’s work was discussed. He started studying his papers and got hooked. After PhD, he spent some time at Max Planck as a postdoc, before moving to Singapore to teach at Singapore Management University. Soon, he was missing the exciting research at Max Planck so much, that he decided to go back. When he speaks about his work, his enthusiasm can spill over. “This is not some abstract stuff. This is what people do in real life,” he said.</p>

<h3>The skeptical statistician</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer’s own intellectual journey started when was wondering why he chose a career in academics over entertainment music years ago. &nbsp;“As a musician at that time, I was earning, may be, five or ten times more than what an assistant professor would earn. Now, I did not sit down and list all possible consequences of staying in music, all possible consequences of going to academia, weigh them and add them up, because that made no sense. I wouldn’t have been able to estimate all of them. I just took the decision. It was a qualitative decision. Thinking about it, got me interested in how people make decisions.”</p>

<p>Gigerenzer was contrasting his decision making process to a method that has been long popular among intellectuals of scientific temper. They believed one can arrive at an optimal decision by listing down all the likely advantages and disadvantages of various options. Charles Darwin tried that technique to decide on whether to marry or not. Benjamin Franklin strongly recommended this method - he called it Moral Algebra - to his nephew who was looking for his wife. “if you do not learn it, I apprehend you will never be married,” Franklin wrote to him. It has not vanished. We will find some version of this method being practiced by the bureaucracy in government and business even today. Gigerenzer saw that he didn’t use this method to make one of the most important decisions of his life. In fact, most of us don’t. Our decisions are mostly qualitative, not quantitative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I started as a student i didn’t know very much about psychology,” Gigerenzer said. “Basically, I knew about Freud and a few other psychoanalysts. I quickly realised that I can explain almost everything with these concepts. I got disinterested. I didn’t want a theory that explains everything. Then I got interested in personality psychology. I remember there was a big book, 400-500 pages, on the subject and I knew it almost by heart. Some friends …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Members of Congress said troops at the Capitol have been hospitalized, because their food is below substandard quality.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — In their final days protecting the U.S. Capitol from a potential reprise of domestic terrorism, members of the Michigan National Guard reported metal shavings, feathers, and undercooked meat found in substandard meals, a potential readiness risk that has hospitalized troops.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Michigan members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter Tuesday to Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, expressing their displeasure with the findings.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>"It is completely unacceptable that our men and women serving in Washington D.C are being hospitalized due to the food they are being provided," the letter said. "We request that either the current contract be voided and a new food provider be brought in or that the service members be provided with a per diem throughout their remaining time in Washington, D.C.”</p>
                    <p>According to a closed-door National Guard update given to members of Congress, 59 people had wide-ranging gastrointestinal issues because of food consumed at the Capitol. Some of the troops managed their conditions in their quarters, others required a hospital diagnosis.</p>

                    <p>As reports of undercooked and underprepared food increased Monday, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Daniel Kildee, Democrats of Michigan, called for the firing and replacement of the meal contractor, sending appeals directly to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>“It is simply unacceptable that these men and women are being fed chicken with the feathers still attached, and raw ground beef,” Peters wrote to Hokanson. “After several attempts to rectify the situation and little progress, I believe that the only appropriate course of action is for the immediate cancellation of the existing food contract, the disbursement of per diem for the remaining duration of the mission and to provide retroactive per diem.”</p>
                    <p>Roughly 1 in 5 of the National Guard troops within the Capitol perimeter are from Michigan. Their mandate expires March 12, when Defense Sec. Lloyd J. Austin III said all troops are expected to leave the Capitol grounds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26332034">very skeptical of the claim</a>. Will he end up eating his shirt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schnorr is 78 years old. I am not gerontophobic (being 50 I am approaching that age) but: Atiyah claimed the Riemann Hypothesis, Hironaka has claimed full resolution of singularities in any characteristic... And I am speaking of Fields medalists.
So: you do really need peer-review for strong arguments.</p>
