<p>The importance of testing in modern software development is really hard to overstate. Delivering a successful product is not something you do once and forget about but is rather a continuous recurring process. With every line of code that changes, software must remain in a functional state, which implies the need for rigorous testing.</p>
<p>Over time, as the software industry evolved, testing practices have matured as well. Gradually moving towards automation, testing approaches have also influenced software design itself, spawning mantras like test-driven development, emphasizing patterns such as dependency inversion, and popularizing high-level architectures that are built around it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, automated testing is embedded so deeply within our perception of software development, it’s hard to imagine one without the other. And since that ultimately enables us to produce software quickly without sacrificing quality, it’s hard to argue that it’s not a good thing.</p>
<p>However, despite there being many different approaches, modern “best practices” primarily push developers specifically towards <em>unit testing</em>. Tests, whose scope lies higher on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid">Mike Cohn’s pyramid</a> are either written as part of a wider suite (often by completely different people) or even disregarded entirely.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is often supported by the argument that unit tests provide the most value during development because they’re able to catch errors quickly and help enforce design patterns that facilitate modularity. This idea has become so widely accepted that the term “unit testing” is now somewhat conflated with automated testing in general, losing part of its meaning and contributing to confusion.</p>
<p>When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these “best practices” to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn’t particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better.</p>
<p>It was only later, as I’ve experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that <strong>focusing on unit tests is</strong>, in most cases, <strong>a complete waste of time</strong>.</p>
<p>Aggressively popularized “best practices” often have a tendency of manifesting cargo cults around them, enticing developers to apply design patterns or use specific approaches without giving them a much needed second thought. In the context of automated testing, I find this prevalent when it comes to our industry’s unhealthy obsession with unit testing.</p>
<p>In this article I will share my observations about this testing technique and go over why I believe it to be inefficient. I’ll also explain which approaches I’m currently using instead to test my code, both in open source projects and day-to-day work.</p>
<p><em>Note: this article contains code examples which are written in C#, but the language itself is not (too) important to the points I’m making.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: I’ve come to realize that programming terms are completely useless at conveying meanings because everyone seems to understand them differently. In this article I will be relying on the “standard” definitions, where unit testing targets smallest separable parts of code, end-to-end testing targets software’s outermost entry points, while integration testing is for everything in-between.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 3: if you don’t feel like reading the entirety of the article, you can skip to the end for the summary.</em></p>
<h2>Fallacies of unit testing</h2>
<p>Unit tests, as evident by the name, revolve around the concept of a “unit”, which denotes a very small isolated part of a larger system. There is no formal definition of what a unit is or how small it should be, but it’s mostly accepted that it corresponds to an individual function of a module (or method of an object).</p>
<p>Normally, when the code isn’t written with unit tests in mind, it may be impossible to test some functions in complete isolation because they can have external dependencies. In order to <em>work around</em> this issue, we can apply the dependency inversion principle and replace concrete dependencies with abstractions. These abstractions can then be substituted with real or fake implementations, depending on whether the code is executing normally or as part of a test.</p>
<p>Besides that, unit tests are expected to be pure. For example, if a function contains code that writes data to the file system, that part needs to be abstracted away as well, otherwise the test that verifies such behavior will be considered an integration test instead, since its coverage extends to the unit’s integration with the file system.</p>
<p>Considering the factors mentioned above, we can reason that <strong>unit tests are only useful to verify pure business logic inside of a given function</strong>. Their scope does not extend to testing side-effects or other integrations because that belongs to the domain of integration testing.</p>
<p>To illustrate how these nuances affect design, let’s take a look at an example of a simple system that we want to test. Imagine we’re working on an application that calculates local sunrise and sunset times, which it does through the help of the following two classes:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDisposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HttpClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _httpClient<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDiposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> _locationProvider <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _locationProvider<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although the design above is perfectly valid in terms of OOP, neither of these classes are actually unit-testable. Because <code>LocationProvider</code> depends on its own instance of <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>SolarCalculator</code> in turn depends on <code>LocationProvider</code>, it’s impossible to isolate the business logic that may be contained within methods of these classes.</p>
<p>Let’s iterate on that code and replace concrete implementations with abstractions:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>HttpClient</span> httpClient<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _httpClient <span>=</span> httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span> _locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span><span>ILocationProvider</span> locationProvider<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _locationProvider <span>=</span> locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing so we were able to decouple <code>LocationProvider</code> from <code>SolarCalculator</code>, but in exchange our code nearly doubled in size. Also note that we had to drop <code>IDisposable</code> from both classes because they <strong>no longer own their dependencies</strong> and thus have no business taking responsibility for their lifecycle.</p>
<p>While these changes may seem as an improvement to some, it’s important to point out that the interfaces we’ve defined serve <strong>no practical purpose other than making unit testing possible</strong>. There’s no need for actual polymorphism in our design, so, as far as our code is concerned, these abstractions are <em>autotelic</em> (i.e. abstractions for the sake of abstractions).</p>
<p>Let’s try to reap the benefits of all that work and write a unit test for <code>SolarCalculator.GetSolarTimesAsync</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculatorTests</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Fact</span><span>]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>Task</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync_ForKyiv_ReturnsCorrectSolarTimes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        <span>var</span> location <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Location</span><span>(</span><span>50.45</span><span>,</span> <span>30.52</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>var</span> date <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DateTimeOffset</span><span>(</span><span>2019</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>04</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> TimeSpan<span>.</span><span>FromHours</span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> expectedSolarTimes <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarTimes</span><span>(</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>06</span><span>,</span> <span>55</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>29</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> locationProvider <span>=</span> Mock<span>.</span><span><span>Of</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ILocationProvider</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span>lp <span>=&gt;</span>
            lp<span>.</span><span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> Task<span>.</span><span>FromResult</span><span>(</span>location<span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> solarCalculator <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span>locationProvider<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        <span>var</span> solarTimes <span>=</span> <span>await</span> solarCalculator<span>.</span><span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        solarTimes<span>.</span><span>Should</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>BeEquivalentTo</span><span>(</span>expectedSolarTimes<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we have a basic test that verifies that <code>SolarCalculator</code> works correctly for a known location. Since unit tests and their units are tightly coupled, we’re following the recommended naming convention, where the test class is named after the class under test, and the name of the test method follows the <code>Method_Precondition_Result</code> pattern.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the desired precondition in the arrange phase, we have to inject corresponding behavior into the unit’s dependency, <code>ILocationProvider</code>. In this case we do that by substituting the return value of <code>GetLocationAsync()</code> with a location for which the correct solar times are already known ahead of time.</p>
<p>Note that although <code>ILocationProvider</code> exposes two different methods, from the contract perspective <strong>we have no way of knowing which one actually gets called</strong>. This means that by choosing to mock a specific one of these methods, we are making an <strong>assumption about the underlying implementation</strong> of the method we’re testing (which was deliberately hidden in the previous snippets).</p>
<p>All in all, the test does correctly verify that the business logic inside <code>GetSolarTimesAsync</code> works as expected. However, let’s expand on some of the observations we’ve made in the process.</p>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/motherboard-and-hands-320.jpg" alt="Motherboard and Hands" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I think Covid-19 has re-emphasized the value of self-reliance
      to many of us.  During this pandemic, we have been through
      periods when we couldn't simply pick up a phone and call someone 
      to come to our home to make repairs.  We may also have been 
      unable to go to a local shop to get help.  Since so much of our 
      personal business must now be conducted on line, finding inexpensive 
      computers and making basic repairs to our own computers 
      are becoming important life skills.  Without them, we may be unable 
      to stay connected to the world, to attend school, to work, or even to 
      buy food without risking exposure to a potentially deadly disease.</p>

   <p>Fortunately, repairing a computer or buying a cheap used one is not as 
      difficult as many people seem to believe.  All that is needed is the 
      will to learn to do these things in a hands-on way.  Individuals must 
      be willing to take the risks associated with trying to repair 
      their own computers or buying used computers on line.  For most people, 
      I think this is the stumbling block that they never overcome.  
      What separates the people who can do these things from those who 
      cannot is not intelligence.  It is nothing more than need and 
      interest sufficient to get them past the stumbling block.  
      If you are willing to learn, you will win the battle for 
      computer self-reliance.  I will not tell you that you will not be 
      frustrated at times.  I will only say that, if you keep trying, you 
      will learn these skills.</p>

   <p>In this article, I will outline the knowledge and skills that are 
      necessary to solve most basic computer repair problems.  But first, I 
      will explain one simple step that you can take right now to have a 
      working computer in your home at all times.</p>

   <p>Have a working backup computer in your home to use in the event of 
      the death or loss of your primary 
      computer.  A backup computer need not be expensive.  In fact, you can 
      buy a useful, used computer on Ebay for around $50.  The role of this 
      computer is only to get you on line to do research or to buy parts or 
      other necessities until you can get your primary computer working 
      again, or until you can buy another computer.  A rather 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/surf-internet.html">old computer</a> is capable of meeting 
      these needs.  Some of you may want to use a cellphone for this, and 
      that will work if your cellphone service includes a data plan.  However, 
      for reasons that will become clear later, a fully-functioning computer 
      would be better.  I have written several articles on 
      cheapskatesguide.org that explain how to buy a cheap computer on 
      line.  For suggestions about multiple approaches to getting a cheap 
      laptop, read <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/how-to-get-a-cheap-laptop.html">this 
      article</a>.  For recommendations regarding the best used laptops to 
      buy for less than $100 in the year 2020, read 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/best-laptops-in-2020.html">this</a>.  To obtain a more 
      in-depth understanding of the art of buying a computer that meets your
      needs, go to the <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/helper/core-page.html">Core 
      Articles</a> page and read the articles there in chronological order.</p>

   <p>Now, let me talk about what you need to know to make basic computer 
      repairs.  If you take good care of your computer, the only computer 
      repair that you are likely to need that is not basic is the 
      replacement of your motherboard.  So, if your computer is completely 
      dead or stops booting at the BIOS screen (both symptoms of a bad 
      motherboard), it is most likely time to buy another computer.  If any 
      life at all remains in your computer--if you hear beep codes (beeping 
      sounds when you turn on your computer), see a repeating 
      pattern of flashing 
      lights, or see an error message on the monitor--you may be looking at 
      a computer that you can repair with basic skills.  Below, are the 
      skills that everyone can learn and then use to make basic computer 
      repairs.  Everyone should be able to:</p>
   <br>

   <div>
   <center><h2>Basic Computer Repair Skills Everyone should have</h2></center>
   <ul>
      <li>Diagnose basic computer problems</li>
      <li>Identify compatible parts for a computer</li>
      <li>Research repair methods on line</li>
      <li>Make basic changes to a computer's BIOS settings</li>
      <li>Create a bootable Linux USB drive</li>
      <li>Re-install software</li>
      <li>Replace a hard drive or solid state drive</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
   <p>When you think about it, that is a rather short list.  I think that a
      simple lack 
      of desire is the only thing that prevents most people from obtaining 
      these skills.  In this article, I will not teach you these skills.  I 
      will tell you what you need to know and a little about how to find 
      that knowledge.  I will tell you how to develop the skills.  And, in 
      some cases, I will outline basic repair procedures and tell you how 
      to fill in the details yourself.</p>
   <h2>Diagnosing Basic Computer Problems</h2>
   <p>Most symptoms of computer problems are pretty obvious.  Your keyboard 
      stops working.  A USB connector stops working.  Your computer's monitor 
      doesn't light up.  A message appears on your monitor saying that no 
      operating system was found.  Your computer's sound stops working.  
      The question is not whether a problem exists but whether it is 
      a software problem or a hardware problem.</p><p>The easiest way to rule out a hardware problem is to boot your 
      computer from a reliable, bootable Linux USB flash drive.  If the 
      problem does not go away, then you most likely have a hardware 
      problem.  One obvious exception is that the problem will go away if 
      your hard drive is bad.  I recommend creating a bootable Linux Mint 
      USB flash drive, making sure it works with every piece of hardware on 
      your computer, and setting it aside for when you need it.  Another
      benefit of having a Linux USB flash drive is that if your hard
      drive dies, you will still be able to use your computer to get online.</p>

   <p>If the problem is caused by software, an online search will give you 
      possible sources and procedures to follow to narrow down the problem 
      to one source.  If an error message appears, use an online search 
      engine to search for that exact error message with quotes around it.  
      If you have no error message, you may have more difficulty finding 
      information about the exact source of your problem.  This process can 
      sometimes take several hours, but you are likely to eventually find 
      hints that will lead you to solutions for most computer software 
      problems, especially if the software is common.</p><h2>Identifying Compatible Parts for Your Computer</h2>
   <p>On a modern laptop computer, the battery and hard drive are the only 
      parts that are likely to fail that you can replace with basic 
      skills.  In over 30 years of owning computers, I have never had a 
      single stick of RAM fail.  I have had RAM sticks that have become 
      unseated from their connectors and needed to be pushed back into 
      place.  Beep codes or flashing lights can give you a hint that RAM 
      has become unseated.  Search on line for "computer beep codes" to find 
      the specific beep codes for your computer.</p> 

   <p>You generally only need to know three things to locate a 
      hard drive or Solid State Drive (SSD) that is compatible with your 
      computer: the hard drive's width, its thickness, and the type of 
      connector to which it connects.  You need to buy a replacement hard 
      drive that will physically fit into the space in your computer, and  
      the connector of the hard drive must connect to the connector on your 
      computer's motherboard.  These days, all spinning hard drives are 
      either 2.5 or 3.5 inches wide with SATA connectors.  Most 
      regular-sized desktop computers have 3.5 inch hard drives, but a 
      laptop will never have a 3.5 inch hard drive.  Laptops have either 2.5 
      inch spinning hard drives or some kind of SSD.  If your computer has 
      an SSD, you will have to open up your computer and look at the SSD's
      connector.  Unfortunately, these days, there are a small number of 
      solid state drive connector types that have the same physical 
      connections but are different electrically.  In my opinion, this was 
      a very poor design decision.  Luckily, these SSD's are the only 
      example in the computer industry of which I am aware of this being 
      allowed to occur.  Find a picture of your SSD's connector online and see 
      what type of connector the online source says it is.  Wikipedia is 
      a good place to look for this type of information.  Once you have 
      identified the type of connector on your SSD, see what Wikipedia says 
      about its electrical arrangement.  Do not try to use an SSD with a 
      different type of electrical arrangement, because this is likely to 
      damage the replacement SSD and your computer.</p>
   <h2>Researching Computer Repair Methods on Line</h2>
   <p>When your computer develops a problem, you can almost always find a 
      procedure on line for solving it.  First, you need to know <i>what</i> to 
      do to repair a generic computer with the specific problem you are 
      seeing.  You can read on line about <i>what</i> to do to repair the 
      problem on a generic Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.  Then, if the 
      problem is a hardware problem, you need to know <i>how</i> to 
      physically accomplish the repair of your specific model of computer.  
      A Youtube video can be beneficial for this.  An example of 
      what I mean by "<i>how</i> to physically repair" is the following.  When 
      you open the back of your laptop, what screws do you have to unscrew 
      to release the hard drive?  Do you pull the hard drive straight out 
      perpendicularly from the back of the laptop?  Or, do you slide it 
      parallel to the back of the laptop …</p></div></div>

                 <p>Nerd Roundup Fridays: Pilot Licenses and Clean Code</p>
<p><strong>Looking to learn how to fly?</strong> Check out Pakistan, where 1-in-3 pilots have fake licenses, according to the Transportation Minister. </p>
<p>We suffer with certification mills quite a bit in tech. Resumes will show up with all sorts of certifications and listing experience in cutting-edge tech. When the actual candidate is interviewed, too many times it's obvious they're not qualified for the job and cannot have the experience they say they do. It's even not unusual to have one person do the phone interview and a second person show up for the work. It's not good to see the same pattern happening in aviation. Let's hope they fix it before it spirals further out of control.</p>
<p>Is it time to <strong>stop recommending Clean Code</strong> to developers? One author thinks so. Starting out with the rambling "What is good? We may never know" platitude, the author meanders on from there, cherry-picking various parts of the Clean Code book to disagree ...</p>            </div>

                 <p>Cinema Saturdays: The Disaster Artist</p>
<p>If you're a fan of "Movies so bad they're actually good", then you might have heard of "The Room". It's a 2003 romantic drama (?) widely considered one of the worst movies ever made. A few years' back, one of the leads wrote a book about it, and James Franco decided to take the book and turn it into a movie.</p>
<p>So this is a movie about "How did this junk ever get made?"</p>
<p>I haven't seen The Room, so I can't say if I'd like it or not. Romantic/Drama movies are tough to do realistically for new filmmakers, and the producer/writer/director/star of The Room, Tommy Wiseau,  was completely new and inept at all of that. The Room got made, basically, because some random guy who couldn't act decided he was going to make his own movie, because why not?</p>
<p>The Disaster Artist follows Wiseau and one of the actors from The Room as they meet and become friends. Who is this Wiseau dude? We never really know. He has an awful speech impediment, but when asked, ...</p>            </div>

</table>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Each feed is <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhnrss.org%2Fnewest">valid RSS</a> served over <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=hnrss.org">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<h3 id="firehose-feeds">Firehose Feeds</h3>
<p>The “firehose” feeds contain all new posts and comments as they appear on Hacker News:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest
https://hnrss.org/newcomments
</pre>
<p>For just the posts that have appeared on the front page:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/frontpage
</pre>
<p>If the firehose feeds are a bit too noisy for you, <a href="#activity-parameters">read below</a> on filtering them with the <code>points</code> and/or <code>comments</code> parameters.</p>
<h3 id="search-feeds">Search Feeds</h3>
<p>You can get a feed of new posts and/or comments containing keywords by using the <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=Django
https://hnrss.org/newcomments?q=WordPress
</pre>
<p>If you want a single search feed but multiple keywords, separate the keywords with " OR ":</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=git+OR+linux
</pre>
<h3 id="reply-feeds">Reply Feeds <sup>new</sup></h3>
<p>Keep an eye on replies to your comments:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=jerf
</pre>
<p>Use a comment ID to follow replies to a particular comment:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=17752464
</pre>
<h3 id="self-post-feeds">Self Post Feeds</h3>
<p>Ask HN, Show HN, and polls are available:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/ask
https://hnrss.org/show
https://hnrss.org/polls
</pre>
<h3 id="job-feeds">Job Feeds</h3>
<p>Job opportunities from YC funded startups:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/jobs
</pre>
<p>Top level comments in threads created by the whoishiring bot:</p>
<pre># Comments from "Who is hiring?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs

# Comments from "Who wants to be hired?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/hired

# Comments from "Freelancer? Seeking freelancer?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/freelance

# All of the above
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring
</pre>
<p><span>new</span> If you’re interested in something in particular, you can apply a <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter to only return relevant comments. For example, filter the top-level “Who is hiring?” comments to only those containing “React Native”:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs?q=React+Native
</pre>
<h3 id="user-feeds">User Feeds</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to miss a post or comment by a given user, you can subscribe to that user’s feed:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/submitted?id=USERNAME # posts
https://hnrss.org/threads?id=USERNAME   # comments
https://hnrss.org/user?id=USERNAME      # everything
</pre>
<h3 id="thread-feeds">Thread Feeds</h3>
<p>A feed of new comments on a particular post can be found at:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/item?id=THREAD_ID
</pre>
<p>With <code>THREAD_ID</code> the numerical ID found in the URL when viewing the comments page.</p>
<h3 id="feed-options">Feed Options</h3>
<p>You can modify any feed’s output using URL parameters. Multiple parameters can be applied at the same time by joining them with an ampersand.</p>
<h4 id="activity-parameters">Activity Parameters</h4>
<p>You can apply a <code>points=N</code> or <code>comments=N</code> parameter to any feed to filter the results so only entries with more than N points or comments are shown:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?points=100
https://hnrss.org/ask?comments=25
</pre>
<p>You can also combine both parameters:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/show?points=100&amp;comments=25
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>/newcomments</code> <a href="https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/55#issuecomment-73599729">does not work</a> with a <code>points=N</code> parameter.</p>
<h4 id="search-parameter">Search Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, searches on posts only look at titles. If you want to search against the submitted URLs themselves, use the <code>search_attrs</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre># Search for posts with "WordPress" in the title only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the URL only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=url

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the title or URL
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=title,url

# Don't restrict search attributes at all. This searches for posts
# containing 'WordPress' in all attributes indexed by Algolia. This was
# the behavior of searches prior to June 3, 2015
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=default
</pre>
<h4 id="link-parameter">Link Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, the RSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element points to the submitted article’s URL. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element can be changed to point to the Hacker News comment page by appending <code>link=comments</code> to the end of the URL. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?link=comments</pre>
<h4 id="description-parameter">Description Parameter</h4>
<p>You can disable the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element entirely by passing the <code>description=0</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?description=0</pre>
<h4 id="count-parameter">Count Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, feeds return 20 RSS items. This can be increased via the <code>count=N</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?count=50</pre>
<p>There is a hardcoded limit of 100 entries, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h4 id="feed-formats">Feed Formats <sup>new</sup></h4>
<p>By default, feeds come back as RSS. But if you add “.atom” or “.jsonfeed” to any endpoint you’ll receive the contents in <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">Atom</a> or <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>, respectively.</p>
<pre># The front page as Atom
https://hnrss.org/frontpage.atom

# "Ask HN" with 10 or more comments as JSON Feed
https://hnrss.org/ask.jsonfeed?comments=10
</pre>
<p>Note: These formats are a lot less battle-tested than the RSS format. If you see any wonkiness or they don’t play nicely with your feed reader, please <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss/issues/new">open an issue</a> with as much information as possible. Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
<p>hnrss.org is served by nginx on DigitalOcean. HTTPS is provided by Let’s Encrypt. DNS is provided by Namecheap.</p>
<p>As of September 2018, the feeds are generated using the <a href="https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/">Gin</a> web framework. From May 2014 to August 2018, the feeds were generated using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework.</p>
<h2 id="repositories">Repositories</h2>
<p>A brief primer on the various repositories that make up hnrss.org:</p>
<p>When hnrss.org was created in May 2014, code and documentation lived inside the <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> repository.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the documentation was revamped, migrated into Hugo, and was given its own repository at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The built assets were copied into the <code>docs/</code> folder on <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> and published at <a href="https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/">https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/</a>.</p>
<p>In August/September 2018, hnrss.org underwent a rewrite from Flask to Gin. This new code lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p>So, as of September 2018, that’s the state of play. The documentation source lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The Gin source that powers hnrss.org lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> contains the Flask code that powered the site from May 2014 to August 2018 as well as the <code>docs/</code> folder that contains the built HTML copied from <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>.</p>
<p>At some point I’d like to simplify all of this and run everything out of one repository, but it’ll do for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>February 2015</h3><p>I was working for a startup based in Jerusalem called Curiyo. Back then I had a nice routine: I wake up around 6 am, go to the gym with my buddy, come back to my room to take a shower, eat a bowl of salad and then leave for work. I get to work around 9 am, leave around 5 to meet friends, hang out, or do whatever activity I was planning for that evening.</p><p>In September of the same year, I went on my first trip abroad. I went with my best friend from high school on a 2-week trip to Italy. And as they say, I caught the travel bug. After that trip, all I could think about was planning the next ones and when I could fly again. And since then, I started traveling literally every month.</p><p>One day, I found a blog post about digital nomads and remote work. "This is it, this is what I want!", I said to myself, and the race began to figure out how I could make that happen. A couple of months later, I landed my first remote job with Toptal and signed up for a 3-month trip around southeast Asia (SEA). And in September 2016 -a year after my first trip- I was in Thailand working remotely, enjoying the beach, drinking fresh coconut water, and calling myself a digital nomad.</p><p>"Work hard, play harder": that is the digital nomad slogan. Each day’s schedule looked different from the day before, depending on what I felt like doing or what the group I’m with is planning. In other words, it’s impossible to have a fixed routine, you have to be flexible and dynamic. Otherwise, you will either have to choose between FOMO or doing a shitty job at your work so you don’t miss whatever fun others are having.</p><h3>February 2017</h3><p>After my 3-month trip to SEA, it was time to go back to Jerusalem to see my family and plan the next move. I wasn’t excited to go back, I grew up in Jerusalem and till that point, it’s where I spent all my life. It was so hard and boring after what I’ve experienced, I just came back after spending 3 months in heaven.</p><p>Suddenly there were no more beaches, no more parties, or random strangers to hang out with. There was a lot of free time thatI had no idea what to do with. All I was doing every day was leaving my parents’ house, go to the university campus where I spent five years getting my computer engineering degree, and work till it’s so hard to keep my eyes open.</p><p>I filled all the free time I had with work. I created an outsource web development company with a friend and worked 14h a day 7 days a week, I became a workaholic. I was hoping that by creating a successful business I will have the means to escape my city and move elsewhere to go back to the heavenly life I had for a short period.</p><p>After 3 months of long days and restless nights mishmash, I realized that wasn’t what I wanted. Of course, I still wanted to build my own business, but I didn’t like the path I was taking. And one day I found myself writing this:</p><p>I woke up late, as usual, tried to open my exhausted eyelids. I had skipped the usual question “What’s the plan for today?” and left my bed. It has been almost 3 months since the last time I answered that question, after the first week of going back to Jerusalem it was the same day repeating itself over and over again. Wake up, go to the university campus, meet the same people, and work for 12-14 hours.</p><p>Everything was the same that day except one thing, one thought. When suddenly I found myself shouting out loud to myself “Oh shit, I’m not happy, FUCK!” after a voice inside my head asked: “Are you happy?”. The answer was obviously no. I just realized I was on auto-pilot and forgot to ask myself such a trivial question. “If you are not happy, what is the point?” I kept asking myself for the rest of the day.</p><p>Work was just my way to escape reality and fill my free time. All that made me wonder: do I have to bury myself in work and live miserably now so that my future self can be happy?&nbsp;</p><p>Probably many of you will say “yes”, or maybe you will hesitate a bit before saying “no”. But that doesn’t change the fact that it is actually what we all do somehow. All of us work hard today hoping that tomorrow, next week, next month, or a year from now we will be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled.</p><p>This led me to another question that has changed everything: <strong>what is the point of chasing big dreams and goals if I'm not enjoying the way to get there?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I didn’t have a clear answer to this question so, in a way or another, my answer was <strong>procrastination</strong>. On one side, I wanted to build a business and create great things. On the other side, I didn’t want to work (hard) on anything as long as I don’t know how to be happy while doing it!</p><h3>June 2017</h3><p>After several months and hustling paperwork, I moved to Germany, and my digital nomad life was on again. Since then, I’ve spent the last 3+ years, traveling around the world, exploring, having fun, and creating memories. I was living the dream that many people dream of. A was living a life with no routine whatsoever, wake up whenever I want, work whenever I want, and tomorrow is always an unplanned adventure.</p><p>You can say everything was perfect, but still, the old dream was bugging me, I want to build and create a successful business, my own business. I never liked the idea of working for someone and trading my time for money. And between fun and procrastination, I was trying to build stuff and bootstrap ideas, but things were always falling between the cracks. With a lifestyle like that, it’s really hard to say no to the sunny beach outside and go work 10 hours on a side project. So as a result, procrastination became my new lifestyle.</p><h3>March 2020</h3><p>I left Mexico for a 2-week trip to San Francisco, I had a lot of traveling planned for this year. Things would have stayed on the same path as before for at least another couple of years if it wasn’t for COVID-19.<br></p><p>Two weeks into the pandemic, I found myself without work and without anything else to do. No travel, no friends around, nothing. This time, I didn’t only have a lot of free time, but all my time became free time. History got a chance to repeat itself, and I had a decision to make. Do I want to re-live 2017 all over again? Do I want to keep myself busy with side projects and endless work?&nbsp;<br></p><p>The feeling from 3 years ago was still fresh in my memory that I didn’t want to fall into that trap again. That was an opportunity I had to take advantage of. I was living alone with no distraction of any kind, It was a chance to rediscover myself and what I really want.</p><p>My goal was to bootstrap a business while having a work life balance. I didn’t want to spend 14 hours on my laptop and feel like it was sucking the life out of me. I believed it was possible to bootstrap without falling into the workaholism swamp.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0eb03257a01af20a5e4_iZLNJNTTrlnhbqu6GYvnavIObyReSuyqU1-_DJxGfOeSpFmF8hzwy3AryXXXt0pxgt7dn0EkcqU2AAEDMG8i5AS7HAfEUP0GlsyIOdpqtN07TOSJopLFwNzxQ3HwUjMJw5YSN36s.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Earlier this year I was somewhere on the bottom left side. To shift toward the right I had to deal with my procrastination problem. Since nothing I’ve tried before worked for me, I decided to learn everything I can about the subject and challenge myself to write a book about it, this book! I’m trying to prove to myself (and others) that it’s possible to live in the middle, a place where you can be productive and happy.</p><p><strong>“A bird in the hand is worth t̶w̶o̶ ten in the bush”</strong></p><p>My best friend, who is running an online business with ~$300k ARR, is on the opposite side of the curve. He is the most dedicated hard working person I know, but he’s not happy. When I asked him about it, he said he doesn’t believe it’s possible to have that balance. For him, you can’t be productive (grow fast enough) and happy at the same time. His goal is to have a big stable business by age 40 so he can relax and enjoy life then.</p><p>I don’t want that, I don't want to build a business if my happiness is the price. I don't want to live on 30% happiness for the promise that my future self will be 100% in five or ten years. It's not only that 100% happiness is not realistic, but I also believe my future self will still be stuck on the same hamster wheel convincing himself that he needs another 5 years to get to the imaginary perfect happiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0edf9a94c0bc0e6cd9f_Ngrb7PW6OqzpCoN3VZ8zAT8vHN_BKz_ZRkF_1Ze-89S6gTlwS6qyz89AWZIy-r5M6aleCzSf5xq-qp0OG1qkgdq14HcQdSlY1F6TkBny8CtjNETh2sdP4f0dgcuKCAnqFIVf3wiu.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Workaholism will blind you, you no longer see the big picture, you have no time to think and re-think, and you work for the sake of the work itself. And without a proper system and regular stops where you pause to double-check where you are heading, the wheel will just spin faster and faster until it eventually spits you out and throws you against the wall.</p><p>I know, sometimes you have something you are so excited about and it doesn’t feel like work. But pure excitement doesn’t last forever. Eventually, you will have to work on other boring and less exciting parts of your project. And once that initial excitement fades away, you either quit or close your eyes and hit the gas pedal to become a workaholic zombie.</p><p>However, life is not easy and you can’t always accomplish things while relaxing and taking it easy. Sometimes you have no other option but to push so hard, for days, weeks, or even months. The problem starts when you have no idea when you are going to lift your foot off the gas pedal to look around and see where you are going and check if you should make a turn and change directions.</p><p>So let’s glue all pieces together. A Procrastinator has this <strong>Instant Gratification Monkey (1)</strong> who wants immediate rewards, to have fun, and enjoy the moment without giving a shit about the future. A workaholic has a <strong>Panic Monster (2)</strong> who wants to work so hard and sacrifice everything today so you can be happy tomorrow.</p><p>The answer to the question: “How do you chase big dreams and without depriving yourself happiness?” is the same answer to the question: “Where could your instant gratification monkey meet your panic monster?” You need both.The monkey is as important as the monster, we’ll see that in the chapter “The Productive Procrastinator”. While in other chapters, we try to find that meeting point, as the sole purpose of this book is not to help you just be a productive person but a <strong>happy</strong> productive person.</p><p>1,2:&nbsp;originally presented in Tim Urban's <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">blog post</a></p><p>‍<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5ef900053c15adf3558a9fb8_1*Bx1xIfh3q-_hY0LzmbLePg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>📕 This chapter is …</p></div></div>

So I went on a source code analysis journey! See the <a href="https://smitop.com/post/reddit-whiteops.md">main post</a> for more details.</p><p>It appears Reddit uses <a href="https://whiteops.com/">White Ops</a> for fingerprinting and ad fraud prevention (but only sometimes, I think it’s an A/B test). See this beautified code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>e</span>.<span>user</span>.<span>account</span> <span>?</span> <span>Jt</span>()(<span>e</span>.<span>user</span>.<span>account</span>.<span>id</span>).<span>toString</span>() <span>:</span> <span>void</span> <span>0</span>,

}), document.<span>head</span>.<span>appendChild</span>(<span>s</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This code is only run if the <code>show_white_ops</code> feature flag is enabled (don’t know how to force this to be true), which is why I assume the tracking is done by <a href="https://www.whiteops.com/">WhiteOps</a>.
Further research into the <code>https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js</code> file reveals that it ends up loading another script, <code>https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js</code>. For reference, here is <a href="https://smitop.com/whiteops-main.js">the beautified source code I saw and analyzed</a>.</p><p>Note: here is a function I used to deobfuscate many strings in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>deob</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> =&gt; <span>x</span>.<span>replace</span>(<span>/[A-Za-z]/g</span>, <span>function</span>(<span>e</span>) {

})
</code></pre></div><p>Note 2: Ozoki appears to be some sort of internal codename used by WhiteOps.</p><p>This very obfuscated script does many things, including (this is an incomplete list, I have missed many things):</p><ul><li>Communicates with <code>vprza.com</code> and <code>minkatu.com</code></li><li>Does device/OS detection</li><li>Attempts to detect if DevTools is open (looks at <code>__IE_DEVTOOLBAR_CONSOLE_COMMAND_LINE</code>)</li><li>Something weird with the <code>text-underline-offset</code> CSS property</li><li>Has the names of a bunch of ad servers, presumably as to not serve ads to bots</li><li>Attempts to create an <code>ActiveXObject</code> (only exists in old IE versions), and checks if the created ActiveX object <code>isSandboxed</code></li><li>Checks for <code>maxConnectionsPerServer</code> and <code>onhelp</code> properties on <code>window</code> (for browser engine detection I think)</li><li>Attempts to exploit an IE11 vuln!<ul><li>it checks the value of <code>document.documentMode</code>, which in IE11 is <code>11</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently decided to switch the engine of
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> from TypeScript
to Rust. The application itself is an SPA written in Svelte.
I only switched the logic that updates the game state to Rust.
Here is a summary of my experience with the transition:</p><h2>Isomorphic Architecture</h2><p>One of the advantages of using JavaScript or TypeScript is
that you can run the same code on both client and server.
For <a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a>, this means
that the game state can be updated independently on both sides.
This results in a lag-free experience on the client
while still using the server as the authoritative source of
data.</p><p>With <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> taking off, you can get the same advantage
writing Rust. Instead of pushing client-side code to the server, we push server-side code to the client by compiling Rust
to WebAssembly.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust">Rollup</a>
plugin allows you to import a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file into your
TypeScript codebase, allowing a seamless integration between
Rust and TypeScript code. The dev experience is almost as smooth
as writing TypeScript itself (for example, the browser refreshes
automatically when you change a line of Rust code).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a>
facilitates serialization of Rust structs into JSON objects
and vice-versa.</p><h2>Limitations of TypeScript</h2><p>Coding in TypeScript has been a largely pleasant experience,
but switching to Rust immediately brought to light some of the
limitations of TypeScript.</p><h4>Strict Typing</h4><p>TypeScript is more of a type-hinter than a type-checker.
It primarily ensures that you’re not accessing fields that
you aren’t declaring via the type system (which is quite expressive). It also enables nicer autocomplete for your IDE.</p><p>However, it does not actually ensure that the data you are
manipulating corresponds to the type that you have declared
to represent it. For example, the data might contain <strong>additional fields</strong> or
even <strong>incorrect</strong> values for declared types.</p><h4>Data Validation</h4><p>You have to write data validation code to ensure that you’re
operating on correct data in TypeScript. You get this for
free in Rust, which will throw an error if you parse data
that doesn’t line up with the struct that is to hold it in
memory.</p><h4>Error Handling</h4><p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">error handling</a> make it easy to
handle every code path that could result in an error, leading
to very robust code.</p><p>This leads to a great degree of confidence that if it compiles,
it’s probably not going to throw an error at runtime.</p><h2>Performance</h2><h4>WebAssembly is faster than JavaScript</h4><p>The initial rewrite without any performance optimizations
is already faster than the previous TypeScript codebase.
This doesn’t matter too much yet, but
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> will eventually
ship with bots, so the performance will matter once
game trees need to be searched.</p><h4>The Rust server is leaner</h4><p>The multiplayer server receives updates from clients via
WebSockets and then:</p><ul><li>Updates its copy of the game state.</li><li>Broadcasts the client update to other clients.</li></ul><p>The previous server used <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws">ws</a>, a popular library for NodeJS. The new version uses <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> (Rust), which uses less memory
under the same load.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the switch. I haven’t really
encountered much resistance from the borrow checker despite
being fairly new to Rust (I come from a C++ background, so
maybe that helps).</p></div></div>]]>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Online abuse of trust is one of the topics I’ve studied deeply, including significant work toward an unfinished <a href="https://levien.com/thesis/thesis.pdf">PhD</a>, and over two years working on a spam and abuse team at Google. These days my main work is on 2D graphics, but seeing patterns of misinformation about Covid-19 is bringing back interest and motivation to think about these topics.</p>

<p>As Covid-19 has been unfolding, I’ve spent significant time and energy trying to understand it, as I tend to do with threats in general. In so doing, I’ve developed some insight on how to tune media consumption patterns towards more truthful content and less misinformation.</p>

<h2 id="america-is-broken">America is broken</h2>

<p>The astonishingly poor national response to Covid-19 is heartbreaking. Given our incredible richness of resources, it is surprising that many of the failure modes resemble those from low-income countries: superstition, cult of personality, suppression of science, and straight up corruption. A common thread is misinformation and disinformation.</p>

<p>Our response to Covid-19 has been very much like driving a car with poorly-maintained brakes. We’ve done the equivalent of neglecting regular maintenance, ignoring the brake light on the dashboard, and choosing to not to pay attention to the squishy feeling of the brake pedal. It’s as if there’s a devil on our shoulder saying, “oh no, don’t get the brakes fixed, it might cost hundreds of dollars.”</p>

<p>I think it’s worth trying to understand <em>why</em> we’re in that position, but it’s beyond the scope of this blog post. Mass behavior of humans is pretty predictable, but individual choices can probably make some difference. I have no answers for those who <em>want</em> to listen to that devil (a big challenge in and of itself), but for those would prefer to listen to the angel instead, I have some tips.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-a-partisan-issue">It is a partisan issue</h2>

<p>I often see the plea “it is not a partisan issue” attached to factual arguments. I think this represents an aspiration: it <em>should</em> not be partisan. In 2020 America, the reality is that there is a powerful anti-science, anti-truth faction, and that faction makes up a large part of the composition of one of the political parties. It’s not 100% alignment, and I want to give credit where credit is due: for example, the moderate Republican governor of Massachusetts has embraced science and investment in public health, and the results in that state are one of the best in the country.</p>

<p>But in general, any factual argument that has bearing on a political question such as “should we invest in public health” or “should we restructure the economy away from carbon consumption” is now inherently partisan.</p>

<p>Much of the partisan content in media is around issues that are not very consequential, either pure entertainment, or (at least traditionally) between candidates or parties that have comparable ability to govern. I was hopeful that the life or death nature of Covid-19 would motivate the people who decide what appears in media to higher standards. But apparently, it’s just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog">nature of the scorpion</a>, they either can’t help themselves or just don’t care. Almost certainly, the media organization with the most blood on its hands is Fox News, which actively promotes an anti-health, pro-infection agenda. I don’t understand how they sleep at night.</p>

<p>Truth threatens a lot of existing power structures. If everybody woke up tomorrow and decided they were tired of being lied to, there would be seismic shifts of power. It’s worth thinking about who might be most affected by such a thing, and the kinds of things they do to keep it from happening.</p>

<h2 id="high-end-science-journalism">High-end science journalism</h2>

<p>I’m going to cover a range of information sources in this post, but there is a tl;dr: read up on actual science journalism by people who know what they’re talking about. Coverage by Science, Nature, and STAT News has been uniformly excellent. Good journalism is always teamwork, but I’ll also raise up the voices of particularly insightful individuals: <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencecohen">Jon Cohen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kakape">Kai Kupferschmidt</a> of Science, <a href="https://twitter.com/amymaxmen">Amy Maxmen</a> of Nature, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell">Helen Branswell</a> of STAT News. These are science journalists who have invested years in honing their craft.</p>

<p>I’ve also been impressed by coverage in The Atlantic. Their science content is quite good (thanks to top-notch contributors such as <a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209">Ed Yong</a>), but they also put the science in the context of American culture and politics. It is for this reason, I believe, that our President has <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/05/27/the-atlantic-saw-subscriptions-surge-after-trump-tweet/">singled them out</a> for criticism.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that these sources tend to be publications that have been around for a while (STAT News is a brand of the Boston Globe media group). It’s not exactly rocket science how to do this, you just need to find experienced, capable writers and pay them to do journalism, with editorial and institutional support. But in today’s hyper-capitalist society, sustaining such efforts is a struggle. If you can, try to support publications that do good work by subscribing, or donating in the case of non-profits.</p>

<p>For someone with a limited budget of time and attention, good science journalism is absolutely the best bang for the buck. The other recommendations in this post are for people who want to spend a little more effort to gain, hopefully, a little more insight.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>By far the most interesting experience I’ve had has been Twitter. What makes Twitter unique is its extremely wide dynamic range of information quality: both the worst of the worst and the best of the best are well represented. (An example of an information source of low dynamic range is an encyclopedia: almost every article is pretty good, garbage and brilliance both being rare)</p>

<p>A well-curated Twitter feed is one of the best information sources available today, and following random people on Twitter is one of the worst.</p>

<p>Even though it has no formal structure such as subreddits, Twitter functions as a set of overlapping communities, often described as “X Twitter” or “Y Twitter” (incidentally, a good explanation of how communities work on Twitter can be had in Jeff Jarvis’ <a href="https://buzzmachine.com/2020/05/11/a-conversation-with-nathan-allebach-steak-umms-voice/">interview of the voice behind Steak-umm</a>). There are many experts who generously share their knowledge and thoughts with us, and I’ve found that with a modest investment of time, it’s possible to follow along.</p>

<p>In one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCud8VIawWp17jKl2Lp0VvlQ">Jeff Jarvis interviews</a>, they jokingly referred to “idiot Twitter,” and, though it was a joke, the concept has stuck with me. Twitter, like all social media properties, works by engaging very large numbers of people with content that appeals emotionally. The expert communities are far too small a fraction of Twitter’s traffic to be profitable for them, but they support them as a way to maintain the prestige of the platform. The replies of any popular post are filled with all manner of conspiracy theory, miracle cure, denial, blame, and, I think at least sometimes, active disinformation by those who would do us harm (it’s hard to tell the difference and the outcome is the same). I think of all that as “idiot Twitter” and just do my best to avoid it. I also see it everywhere, of course, not just Twitter, and the quantity of it is a good measure of the value in a social media platform.</p>

<p>Twitter has a delicate balance to maintain, as there are many aspects of the site design that push you toward “idiot Twitter” even when you’re trying to curate your experience to avoid it. One example that consistently frustrates me is the trending panel, as that seems to be about half composed of idiot Twitter. It’s addictive, even so, because it tempts you with the thrill of discovering things early. I’ve also found that it’s easier to avoid junk on the desktop site than the mobile app. I’m worried the experience will degrade; Quora stands as a cautionary tale of what can happen to a relatively respectable site when they pursue clicks at the cost of all else.</p>

<p>Whether it would be viable to develop a social network designed for quality of discussion is another topic beyond this blog. I’m not especially hopeful on this front, as it’s hard to see how it would be profitable. In any case, there’s not much value in wishing for the possibly impossible, as somebody seeking quality information can find it even today.</p>

<h3 id="list-curation">List curation</h3>

<p>One of the interesting features of Twitter is that people will curate and share lists of people they feel are worth following. My <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1239639611694911489">covid-19 list</a> is one such, and a lot of thought went into it: I’ve intentionally included people with a wide range of expertise (including, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/j_g_allen">Joseph Allen</a> for his insight into healthy buildings and <a href="https://twitter.com/uche_blackstock">Dr. Uché Blackstock</a> for expertise on health equity). I’ve also deliberately excluded people from this list who express strong political views or often use an emotional tone. Because of the latter criterion, it’s missing people I personally feel are worth listening to, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/gregggonsalves">Gregg Gonsalves</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKonyndyk">Jeremy Konyndyk</a>. As always, your mileage may vary. The goal of this particular list is not to be comprehensive, it’s to select a set of voices that have excellent signal to noise ratio; for a much more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1237834151694303234">this one curated by Jeff Jarvis</a>.</p>

<p>One phenomenon I’ve noticed is that people at the top of these lists tend to recommend each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if some automated evaluation (perhaps based on eigenvalues) could yield a good curated list. That said, in my past research, I’ve found that any automatic metric with an incentive will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">gamed</a>, and invariably will lift up self-promoters over quiet, thoughtful voices.</p>

<p>Speaking of self-promoters, two names do not belong on lists of top experts, but are often found there: Eric Feigl-Ding &amp; Laurie Garrett. Both are good communicators, but are also sloppy enough with their science to get called out regularly. Inclusion of these names is a sign that a list of experts is not especially carefully curated.</p>

<p>Another important warning sign is lack of inclusion of women and people of color; mainstream media is often guilty of this. Health equity is an especially important part of the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I know, I know, at this point you want "Just Ship It" to be an actual person so you could punch it in the face. As an Indie Maker, that sentence can be super frustrating because it's tired, it's cliche, and your response is always "HEY! You don't understand... it's not that easy".  </p>&nbsp;<p>I agree, it's not easy, but it's always the right thing to do. </p>&nbsp;<p>Here's why.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started building an app on 01.01.2018. It was New Year's Eve and we just had the crappiest night ever. Yes, imagine a night <em>so bad</em> that at midnight you decide "you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna work on WEB DEVELOPMENT".<br>That bad.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The MVP was ready in a few days. I'm not that good of a coder, it's just a simple app. The 0.0.1 alpha version was more than ready. I could've released it, share it with a couple of people, and call it a day. I could've done that with every single version that I made, at any point from 2018 until now. I just wanted to add one more thing. One more feature. Just this one more thing and people will like it. One more screen and everything is gonna make sense. I swear, just this one last thing and it's ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>BAM, last moment decision from the world's biggest dumbass:
"People wouldn't use this if it doesn't have a proper native mobile app for it. Time to learn React Native and spend a few months on that 🤦️"   </p>&nbsp;<p>God, if time machines were real, past-Kitze would be shoved in a toilet so hard right now. </p>&nbsp;<p>After 2 years of development, juggling between the fucking horror that's the web platform, React Native, Expo, GraphQL, bitching about how there's no ideal tech stack, the good old jQuery and Filezilla days, switching to other projects, releasing <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other apps</a>, losing passion, finding passion, coming back to the app, etc. etc. etc...  </p>&nbsp;<p>I just dropped it.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was still using it but I stopped developing it and just dropped the idea of releasing the app, ever.</p>&nbsp;<p>After a while, I was using it, but I realized that I'm missing a lot of features, so I'd either have to go back to developing it, or I'd have to find an alternative.   </p>&nbsp;<p>And boy did I find one.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was scrolling their landing page and I was happy and furious at the same time. Someone solved the problem that I was solving. It was like someone literally read my mind and started coding. WHAT.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I have previously sent a video of my app to a couple of people (closest I came to shipping it) so I started getting suspicious if someone actually shared the video of my app with these people because they were solving literally the same problem, and they most of the features that I had.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started getting this overwhelming happy, sad, and panicky feeling. I literally cannot explain how I felt while scrolling their page.</p>&nbsp;<p>One moment I am scrolling their list of features giggling like a little kid with a 48$ bill in a candy store (yea I know 48$ bills don't make sense, but JavaScript doesn't make sense and you're still using it), one moment I want to find these people and THROW THEM IN A PIT OF LIONS.   </p>&nbsp;<p>FUCK.    </p>&nbsp;<p>It's not their fault. I was just slow. I didn't ship on time. I'm gonna go ahead and tattoo "JUST SHIP IT" on my forehead. Nah I wouldn't be able to see it there. On my arm maybe. Nvm, let me go back to scrolling their landing page.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Fuck. They have solved everything that I wanted to solve, and WAY more. Hey, maybe I should be happy? I don't have to code anymore. Yay!? No more web platform? BLISS. Oh crap... the world is never gonna see my app though. But at least I don't have to see React Native anymore. NICE! Wait... BUT I WASTED SO MUCH TIME ON IT. FUCK.  A bunch of mixed feelings.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Here comes the saddest part, so grab a pack of tissues.   </p>&nbsp;<p>After a little bit of hesitation, I made an account. I watched the videos in their help center. Every time I caught myself smiling about a clever way they implemented something I slapped myself. NO. Bad Kitze. You shouldn't like this. THEY'RE COMPETITORS. <em>sigh</em> Sure buddy, whatever you tell yourself. Competitors to a shitty codebase sitting on your hard drive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>For 2 frickin' years, I thought it's too early to release my app because it's clunky, buggy, it's missing features, blah, blah, blah. No one would ever use it, right? I was so wrong.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started using their app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Even though they were working on it for the past few years it's still slow, buggy, and super unpolished, it doesn't matter, because they shipped.   </p>&nbsp;<p>Their mobile app is terrible and it needs 10 seconds to sync. It doesn't matter, they shipped. And I'm looking forward to every single update they release.</p>&nbsp;<p>Their backlog of things to do is huge, but it doesn't matter, they ship every single week, and the app is growing along with the community.  </p>&nbsp;<p>"But Kitze, even though tHeY sHiPpEd no one would pay for something unpolished and broken, right?"  </p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, Indie Hackers. So clever, yet so naive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Today my 30-day trial has expired. A tear rolled down my cheek for every single digit of my credit card that I entered in their app. I am officially not only a subscriber, but also a fan. Every time I'll get a payment notification it's gonna feel like stepping on a lego ... glued to a knife. My bank might as well change the notification from "You have paid 5$ to ThatCompany" to "You never shipped, loser".   </p>&nbsp;<p>My app is officially dead.  </p>&nbsp;<p>99% of you are in the same boat right now, but hopefully just a few weeks into your project. Don't be a dumbass like me. Take a breath, roll your eyes at the cliche saying, but please...  </p>&nbsp;<p>Just Ship It.  </p>&nbsp;<p>P.S I would totally release and show you my app but ... it's not ready yet.  </p>&nbsp;<hr><p>Thanks for reading this! I wrote another article about <a href="https://kitze.io/posts/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my successful shipping story</a>, so I'd appreciate if you give it a read!</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

This pop-up was appearing on all pages, even on pages with no audio or video. To find out, I did a bunch of source code analysis and found out.</p><p>Reddit’s source code uses bundling and minification, but I was able to infer that in <code>./src/reddit/index.tsx</code>, a script was conditionally loaded into the page. If the <code>show_white_ops</code> A/B test flag was set, then it loaded another script: <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js</a>. That script loads <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js</a> (although it appears to test for a browser bug involving running JSON.parse with null bytes, and sometimes loads <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js</a> instead, but I haven’t analyzed this file (it looks fairly similar though), and also does nothing if due to <em>another</em> browser bug, <code>!("a" == "a"[0])</code> evaluates to true).</p><p>The purpose of all of this appears to be both fingerprinting and preventing ad fraud. I’ve determined that <code>udkcrj.com</code> belongs to <a href="https://www.whiteops.com/">White Ops</a>. I have infered this from the name of Reddit’s feature flag, and mentions of White Ops which is a “global leader in bot mitigation, bot prevention, and fraud protection”. They appear to do this by collecting <strong>tons</strong> of data about the browser, and analyzing it. I must say, their system is quite impressive.</p><p>Back to the DRM issue, it appears that the script is checking what DRM solutions are available, but not actually using them. However, just checking is enough to trigger Firefox into displaying the DRM popup. Specfically, it looks for Widevine, PlayReady, Clearkey, and Adobe Primetime.</p><p><code>main.js</code> does a bunch of other interesting things, but there’s so many that I’ve written <a href="https://smitop.com/post/whiteops-data">a whole seperate blog post</a> about all of the ones I found.

		<div>

			
<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I don't agree that ECDSA is worse than Ed25519 – both have pros and cons — it takes courage to implement ECDSA over Edward25519. Do you know if they published any code?  This unfortunate marriage may introduce fun and unique bugs</p>— thaidn (@XorNinja) <a href="https://twitter.com/XorNinja/status/1281041946538938368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Thai Duong–author of the BEAST attack against SSL/TLS, among <a href="https://github.com/google/tink">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/google/wycheproof">things</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Dunning-GNUger Effect.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This post is a follow-up to the intro post about <a href="https://www.arvarik.com/visiting-the-stable-marriage-problem">The Stable Marriage Problem</a>.
Check out the previous post to understand the problem/solution because this post examines its implications, particularly in the
modern dating world.</p><hr><h2>Modern Times</h2><p>A fascinating consequence of the internet is how much closer it has brought the problem of finding your soulmate, as well as how
much closer the assumptions in the original Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) are true in reality. The <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf">original paper</a>
from 1962 has assumptions that neither worked then nor now, but it started the discussion on how to best pair people for marriage and any entities for any purpose in general.</p><p>The original SMP assumes that everybody knows everybody so that each person can rank everyone in the opposite gender.
This was a clearly unrealistic assumption back in 1962, however, nothing has been a more unifying resource
in the history of humanity than the interent.</p><p>While the SMP may have been an interesting experiment to replicate in a small closed off town 25 years ago, people are finding other people
at a much greater rate and from a larger and more diverse group, allowing the SMP to simulate real life more accurately.</p><p>The table below shows the top three ways people have met their partner by decade in the past 50 years:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decade / Rank</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1960’s</td><td>Through Friend (19%)</td><td>Through Family (13%)</td><td>Primary / Secondary School (12%)</td></tr><tr><td>1970’s</td><td>Through Friend (21%)</td><td>Through Family (13%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (10%)</td></tr><tr><td>1980’s</td><td>Through Friend (18%)</td><td>Through Coworker (16%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (14%)</td></tr><tr><td>1990’s</td><td>Through Friend (18%)</td><td>Through Coworker (15%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (12%)</td></tr><tr><td>2000’s</td><td>Through Friend (19%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (11%)</td><td>Through Coworker (10%)</td></tr><tr><td>2010’s</td><td>Met Online (19%)</td><td>Through Friend (17%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (15%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href="https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst2017">Source</a></p><p>The 2010’s showed a monumental rise in online dating, and the number of people who have met their significant other online is only
going to continue to grow. Online dating is interesting in particular because it provides us with a breadth of
information on dating patterns in the modern age.</p><p>I wanted to see how the SMP actually worked when run through some simulations, and how well it actually models real life.</p><p>In order to benchmark some variants of the SMP that model real life more accurately, let's start off by simulating the classic problem scenario
proposed over 50 years ago.</p><h2>Simulations</h2><h3>Classic</h3><p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/classic/stable_marriage_problem_classic.py">Python implementation</a>
of the classic SMP solution in order to calculate some initial results on what a 'perfect' world would be like.</p><p>The assumptions in the classic SMP scenario is that everybody knows each other and people's preference towards the opposite
group is randomly and uniformly distributed. This basically means that everybody has an equal chance to be liked by someone of the opposite gender.</p><p>The standard algorithm was run with different population levels and the number of iterations to find a stable
matching as well as the preference rank each person matched with on average was recorded.</p><p>The latter point is shown in the second graph
and is portrayed as the difference between the rank of what every girl got, minus the rank of what every guy got (notice
the title indicates an advantage for men, this is because in pretty much all scenarios the man came out higher in the matching, a.k.a
the 'reacher')</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Classic Simulation" title="Classic Simulation" src="https://www.arvarik.com/static/051e593266690fc942e385c9889cb865/ff59c/classic_simulation_multiple_iterations.png" srcset="https://www.arvarik.com/static/051e593266690fc942e385c9889cb865/5243c/classic_simulation_multiple_iterations.png 240w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/051e593266690fc942e385c9889cb865/ab158/classic_simulation_multiple_iterations.png 480w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/051e593266690fc942e385c9889cb865/ff59c/classic_simulation_multiple_iterations.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>From the simulations we can observe two things:</p><ul><li><p>The first graph demonstrates the <code>O(n²)</code> complexity of the algorithm. We can see that as the community grows larger, even
by a small amount, the amount of iterations it takes to solve the matching problem grows exponentially.</p><ul><li>It shows how the difficulty of finding a stable matching between two people grows at a disproportionate rate when population
of the community increases. </li></ul></li><li><p>The second graph shows the difference in preference ranks for each group of people. It is calculated by examining each
matching and seeing where the woman lies on the man's preference rank and where the man lies on the woman's preference rank.</p><ul><li><p>Since the only difference between the two groups is which group 'proposes' first, we see as an outcome that men have an
advantage in this scenario in that, compared to women, they end up with a partner higher on their preference list.</p></li><li><p>The advantage starts off high, and seems to converge at around 13-14% advantage for men</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Preference Manipulated by Dating Pattern</h3><p>There are some pretty large assumptions being thrown around in the classic SMP scenario.</p><p>In my opinion, the biggest
assumption made is that preference sets are randomly assigned and uniformly distributed. This means that everyone's preference
is not correlated with one another's, and that for large enough populations everyone's attractivness is roughly the same
(based on how the opposite gender ranks).</p><p>I don't know about you, but I certainly don't have an online following of girls gushing over me like Timothée Chalamet does.</p><hr><p>As mentioned before, one of the interesting ramifications of the rise in online dating is the amount of data we can aggregate from it.</p><p>OkCupid periodically releases dating information in <a href="https://theblog.okcupid.com/">their blog</a>, and some time ago they released
some interesting numbers in how men perceive attractiveness of the opposite sex versus women. The following charts outline the discrepancy:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Attractiveness" title="Attractiveness" src="https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/7d769/attractiveness.png" srcset="https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/5243c/attractiveness.png 240w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/ab158/attractiveness.png 480w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/7d769/attractiveness.png 960w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/8ba70/attractiveness.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/okcupid-inbox-attractive/">Source</a></p><p>From the data (specifically the dotted lines) we can see two things:</p><ul><li><p>Men's ranking of women pretty closely resembles a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>.
This is easy to conceptualize as essentially half of women in mens eyes are above average and half are below.</p></li><li><p>Women's ranking of men is more closely related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto distribution</a>, also known as the 80-20 distribution.
With respect to this problem, it means that if we could quantify attractiveness for every guy, the top 20% of men hold 80% of cumulative attractiveness
in the eyes of women. In an unrelated note, Bernie seems a lot more appealing right about now.</p></li></ul><h3>So how do we change our problem?</h3><p>We can tweak our original code so that each gender's preference rankings are more aligned with their respective distribution of opposite
sex attractiveness.</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/distribution/stable_marriage_problem_distribution.py">updated code</a>. Take a
look in particular about the shuffling code for preference lists. The new shuffling code applies the normal distribution for guys
and pareto distribution for girls.</p><p>I ran the same simulations again with the updated code and it produced the following results: </p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="SMP Distribution" title="SMP Distribution" src="https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ff59c/smp_distribution.png" srcset="https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/5243c/smp_distribution.png 240w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ab158/smp_distribution.png 480w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ff59c/smp_distribution.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>This is the same type of data analyzed from the previous simulation, but with much different results:</p><ul><li><p>The first graph shows a similar <code>O(n²)</code> complexity of the algorithm, but the constant value for the graph's equation is much higher</p><ul><li><p>The standard SMP for 1000 pairings took around 7,000 iterations to complete - with the new simulations, the SMP algorithm
runs in about 21,000 iterations, or 3 times as much</p></li><li><p>This makes sense in terms of the distributions. Since more women now have the same few men in the top 20% of their preference lists, the number
of conflicts increases when running the algorithm and causes a lot more men to be dumped and subsequently resume their search for a better soulmate</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The second graph is particularly interesting and shows a marked increase in the 'advantage' men have simply for being the proposers</p><ul><li><p>The increase here stabilizes at around 38-39% and is again around 3 times larger than the advantage men had in the classic SMP scenario</p></li><li><p>This increase also makes sense because of the discrepancies in preferences between men and women. If the average man was paired with the average woman,
the OkCupid data shows that the man would see the woman as average in attractiveness while the woman would see the man as below average attractiveness</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>What Did We Learn From This?</h2><p>There's obviously many gross inaccuaries when trying to reasonably model the dating world, but the SMP offers an initial glimpse as to why dating is so difficult
and why certain tropes exist.</p><h3>Why it's always better to be the initiator</h3><p>A clear callout from the analysis is that men end up having the advantage when everyone is paired. There's two main reason for this:</p><p><strong>1) Societal Expectations:</strong></p><p>Men are traditionally assumed to be the first group to make a move and it is why the men in the code simulations make the first move.
Because men make the first move, the algorithm benefits men as it works in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy behavior</a> to get them the
best possible partner.</p><p>With respect to the problem, any gender can theoretically be the one to make the first move and reap the benefits demonstrated by the SMP simulations.</p><p><span>

    </span> <em>⠀From WikiHow, I can't really draw this well</em></p><p><strong>2) Preferences of Men vs Women:</strong></p><p>The discrepancy in preferences for the opposite sex between men and women is what caused the stable pairing advantage for men to jump from 13% to 39%. While
all other things are held constant, it was the preferences that caused this jump because it all ends up relating to how people <em>perceive</em> attractiveness.</p><p>The OkCupid data shows that women have higher standards for men than men have for women, and this is the main driver for why there is a larger male advantage
when the SMP algorithm incorporated the gender attractiveness distributions.</p><p>I am in no way concluding that women are unhappier with men in their relationships - there are a million other factors including personality, status and chemistry
that affect how each person in the relationship views each other.</p><p><em>However</em>, it does lead us to how the outside world perceives the relationships...</p><h3>Settlers and Reachers</h3><p>The show <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> was a staple TV show during my coming of age years, and it surprisingly had many apt theories surrounding modern dating.</p><p>One of the most notable ones was the concept of Settlers and Reachers - as said in the show:</p><blockquote><p><em>Every good relationship has a reacher and a settler. One person reaches for someone out of their league, while the other one settles for someone below theirs.</em></p></blockquote><p>Based on everything we've learned thus far, we have seen that for the most part the men are the reachers and the women
are the settlers.</p><p>Once again, this is just a generalization that only looks at pairings of …</p></section></div>

<p>A diff algorithm outputs the set of differences between two inputs. These algorithms are the basis of a number of commonly used developer tools. Yet understanding the inner workings of diff algorithms is rarely necessary to use said tools. Git is one example where a developer can read, commit, pull, and merge diffs without ever understanding the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-repack">underlying diff algorithm</a>. Having said that there is very limited knowledge on the subject across the developer community.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not to detail how <a href="https://ably.com/">Ably</a> programmatically implemented a diff algorithm across its distributed <a href="https://ably.com/platform">pub/sub messaging platform</a>, but rather to share our research and provide systematic knowledge on the subject of diff algorithms that could be useful to implementers of diff/delta/patch functionality.</p>

<p>For Ably customers like Tennis Australia or HubSpot, <a href="https://ably.com/blog/message-delta-compression">Message Delta Compression</a> reduces the bandwidth required to transmit realtime messages by sending only the diff of a message. This means subscribers receive only the changes since the last update instead of the entire stream. &nbsp;Sending fewer bits is more bandwidth-efficient and reduces overall costs and latencies for our customers. To develop this feature we needed to implement a diff algorithm that supported binary encoding and didn’t sacrifice latency when generating deltas.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-savings-1.png"><figcaption>The benefits of providing deltas for realtime messaging</figcaption></figure><h2 id="diff-algorithms">Diff algorithms</h2>
<h3 id="purpose-and-usage">Purpose and usage</h3>
<p>The output of a diff algorithm is called <em>patch</em> or <em>delta</em>. The delta format might be human readable (text) or only machine readable (binary). Human readable format is usually employed for tracking and reconciling changes to human readable text like source code. Binary format is usually space optimized and used in order to save bandwidth. It transfers only the set of changes to an old version of the data already available to a recipient as opposed to transferring all the new data. The formal term for this is <em>delta encoding</em>.</p>
<h3 id="binary-vs-text">Binary vs. text</h3>
<div><p>There seems to be a common misconception that diff algorithms are specialized based on the type of input. The truth is, <strong>diff algorithms are omnivorous and can handle any input</strong>, as long as the input can simply be treated as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-2.2.2">string of bytes</a>. That string might consist of the English alphabet or opaque binary data. Any diff algorithm will generate a correct delta given two input strings in the same alphabet.</p><p>The misconception that a different algorithm is required to handle binary data arises from commonly used diff/merge tools treating text and binary as if they were actually different. These tools generally aim to provide a human-readable delta, and as such focus on human-readable input to the exclusion of binary data. The assumption is that binary data is not human-readable so the delta between two binary data inputs will also not be human readable, and thus rendering it human-readable is deemed to be too much effort. Equality is the only relevant output in the case of binary diffs, and as such, a simple bit-by-bit comparison is considered to be the fastest and most appropriate solution. &nbsp;This categorization of algorithms by the efficiency of solution causes a partitioning of inputs into different types.</p><p>Another aspect that adds to the confusion is the line-based, word-based, and character-based classification of textual diff outputs produced by diff/merge tools. A diff algorithm that is described as “line-based” gives the impression that it produces “text-only” output, and that this means that it accepts only text input and never binary data inputs. &nbsp;However, line/word/character-based is not a characteristic of a diff algorithm itself; rather, it is an optimization applied to the input before feeding it to the actual diff algorithm. </p><p>Because new lines and spaces have meaning as separators in human-readable text, the diff tool can segment the string based on the hashes of the lines or words in the text. This hash string is much shorter than the original text thus saving time at the cost of reduced granularity of the diff. &nbsp;Additionally, line-based granularity might actually even increase human readability of the diff in some cases.</p><p>However, if the input is known to be opaque binary data, there are no meaningful separators nor human-readable diff to display, so this optimization cannot be applied. &nbsp;Algorithms <em>capable</em> of optimizing human-readable data before it becomes an input are thus prone to getting miscast as wholly <em>incapable</em> of processing binary data. &nbsp;The truth remains, however: apart from pre-processing optimization, both binary and human-readable data can be treated as strings-of-bytes inputs and easily processed.</p></div>
<h2 id="three-generations-of-diff-algorithms">Three generations of diff algorithms</h2>
<p>The notion of how a diff should be generated has evolved over time.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-arrow-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="string-to-string-correction-or-insert-delete">String-to-string Correction or Insert/Delete</h3>
<p>The first generation of diff algorithms solved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-to-string_correction_problem">string-to-string correction problem</a> and emerged in the 60s and 70s. Each of the two inputs is interpreted as a string composed of characters in some alphabet. The output is a sequence of character edits, most commonly insert/delete operations, that could be applied to one of the inputs to transform it to the other input. That makes this class of algorithms particularly suitable for generating human readable diffs on human readable inputs, e.g. different versions of the same text/source code resulting from actual edits being made over time. What helps even further is that in theory, and more often than not in practice, there is more than one minimal length sequence of edit operations that gets the job done. Various heuristics can be used to pick the edit sequences that most closely resembles actual human made edits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145%2F321796.321811">Wagner-Fischer algorithm</a> set the foundation for this generation of diff algorithms. The <a href="http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf">Myers Algorithm</a> is the latest improvement and the de facto standard for the generation and is currently used in multiple diff tools including the GNU diff utility.This generation of algorithms usually finds either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem">longest common subsequence</a> or the minimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance#Common_algorithm">edit distance</a> (usually that would be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a>) and uses these to generate the sequence of edits needed to transform one input into the other.</p>
<h2 id="block-move-or-copy-insert">Block move or copy/insert</h2>
<h3 id="pure-block-move">Pure block move</h3>
<p>The next generation of diff algorithms was based on seemingly small optimizations over the previous generation. The character edits were upgraded to block-of-characters edits. That is, instead of expressing the diff as operations on single characters, the diff would be expressed as operations on blocks of characters. The operations are usually copy and insert where blocks of data that appear in both inputs are recorded in the delta as copied from one input to the other. The blocks unique to one of the inputs are recorded as insertions. This approach was first proposed by <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.9110&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Walter Tichy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="compression-based-block-move">Compression based block move</h3>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-messages-5.png"><figcaption>How Ably generates deltas in its pub/sub messaging platform using the block move approach</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance, the block move approach seems like a minor optimization. However, it has significant impact once you take into account the possibility that some block(s) of characters can repeat in some or both of the inputs. Thinking about diff generation in terms of copying blocks of data and keeping an eye out for the same block repeating more than once opens the door to using compression algorithms to generate a diff and delta file.</p>
<p>Compression algorithms do just that: find the biggest possible repeating blocks of data and replace each consecutive occurrence with a reference to the first occurrence. Blocks of data that never repeat are copied straight to the output. Compression algorithms are in essence block move algorithms.</p>
<p>If the block move analysis done by a compression algorithm is performed on both inputs of a diff algorithm, it will easily identify the common parts of both inputs. It will also point out which blocks of data are unique, that is different in both of the inputs. Once you have this data, it is straightforward to come up with a sequence of block copy/delete operations that will convert one of the inputs to the other one.</p>
<p>The major benefit of using compression algorithms is the greatly reduced size of the delta. A block of data will never appear more than once in the delta. It might be referred to multiple times but the actual data of the block will be contained in the delta only once. That is a major difference from the preceding approaches. It should also be mentioned that the delta size is reduced at the cost of reduced human readability.</p>
<p><strong>xDelta</strong>, <strong>zDelta</strong>, <strong>Bentley/McIlroy</strong> are widely used de-facto standard implementations of diff algorithms of this generation.</p>
<h3 id="latest-upgrades">Latest Upgrades</h3>
<p>This would be the latest generation of diff algorithms. Most of its members exist only in research papers and don’t have any commercial implementations yet. They are largely based on the block move approach but offer substantial implementation optimizations, which result in claims of double-digit factor improvements in speed over the previous generation.</p>
<p>These optimizations are mostly focused on efficiently finding matching blocks of data in the two inputs. Various incremental hashing or compression-like techniques (such as suffix-trees) are used to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>edelta</strong>, <strong>ddelta</strong>, <strong>bsdiff</strong> could be assigned to this generation of diff algorithms</p>

  <p id="post-date">Jul 8, 2020 • <a href="https://avikdas.com/">Avik Das</a></p>

  <p>Modern OpenGL, and by extension WebGL, is very different from the legacy OpenGL I learned in the past. I understand how rasterization works, so I’m comfortable with the concepts. However, every tutorial I’ve read introduced abstractions and helper functions that make it harder for me to understand which parts are truly core to the OpenGL APIs.</p>

<p>To be clear, abstractions like separating positional data and rendering functionality into separate classes is important in a real-world application. But, these abstractions spread code across multiple areas, and introduce overhead due to boilerplate and passing around data between logical units. The way I <em>learn</em> best is a linear flow of code where every line is core to the subject at hand.</p>

<p>First, credit goes to <a href="https://www.toptal.com/javascript/3d-graphics-a-webgl-tutorial">the tutorial I used</a>. Starting from this base, I stripped down all the abstractions until I had a “minimal viable program”. Hopefully, this will help you get off the ground with modern OpenGL. Here’s what we’re making:</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-07-08-barebones-webgl-in-75-lines-of-code/multi-colored-triangle.png" alt="An equilateral triangle, green on top, black on the bottom-left and red on the bottom-right, with colors interpolated in between."></p>
  <figcaption>
    <p>A slightly more colorful version of <a href="https://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=7745">the black triangle</a></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>

<p>With WebGL, we need a <code>canvas</code> to paint on. You’ll definitely want to include all the usual HTML boilerplate, some styling, etc., but the canvas is the most crucial. Once the DOM has loaded, we’ll be able to access the canvas using Javascript.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;canvas</span> <span>id=</span><span>"container"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"500"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"500"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
  <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>DOMContentLoaded</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// All the Javascript code below goes here</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the canvas accessible, we can get the WebGL rendering context, and initialize its clear color. Colors in the OpenGL world are RGBA, with each component between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. The clear color is the one used to paint the canvas at the beginning of any frame that redraws the scene.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>container</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>gl</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>getContext</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>webgl</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>clearColor</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s more initialization that can, and in real programs should, be done. Of particular note is enabling the <em>depth buffer</em>, which would allow sorting geometry based on the Z coordinates. We’ll avoid that for this basic program consisting of only one triangle.</p>

<h2 id="compile-shaders">Compile shaders</h2>

<p>OpenGL is at its core a rasterization framework, where <em>we</em> get to decide how to implement everything but the rasterization. This entails running at minimum two pieces of code on the GPU:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A vertex shader that runs for each piece of input, outputting one 3D (really, 4D in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous coordinates</a>) positions per input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fragment shader that runs for each pixel on the screen, outputting what color that pixel should be.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In between these two steps, OpenGL takes the geometry from the vertex shader and determines which pixels on the screen are actually covered by that geometry. This is the rasterization part.</p>

<p>Both shaders are typically written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is then compiled down to machine code for the GPU. The machine code is then sent to the GPU, so it can be run during the rendering process. I won’t spend much time on GLSL, as I’m only trying to show the basics, but the language is sufficiently close to C to be familiar to most programmers.</p>

<p>First, we compile and send a vertex shader to the GPU. Here, the source code for the shader is stored in a string, but it can be loaded from other places. Ultimately, the string is sent to the WebGL APIs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sourceV</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
  attribute vec3 position;
  varying vec4 color;

  void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(position, 1);
    color = gl_Position * 0.5 + 0.5;
  }
`</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>shaderV</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createShader</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>VERTEX_SHADER</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>shaderSource</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>,</span> <span>sourceV</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>compileShader</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderParameter</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILE_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to compile vertex shader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, there are a few variables in the GLSL code worth calling out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>An <em>attribute</em> called <code>position</code>. An attribute is essentially an input, and the shader is called for each such input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>varying</em> called <code>color</code>. This is an output from the vertex shader (one per input), and an input to the fragment shader. By the time the value is passed to the fragment shader, the value will be interpolated based on the properties of the rasterization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>gl_Position</code> value. Essentially an output from the vertex shader, like any varying value. This one is special because it’s used to determine which pixels need to be drawn at all.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There’s also a variable type called <em>uniform</em>, which is will be constant across multiple invocations of the vertex shader. These uniforms are used for properties like the transformation matrix, which will be constant for all vertices on a single piece of geometry.</p>

<p>Next, we do the same thing with fragment shader, compiling and sending it to the GPU. Notice the <code>color</code> variable from the vertex shader is now read by the fragment shader.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sourceF</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
  precision mediump float;
  varying vec4 color;

  void main() {
    gl_FragColor = color;
  }
`</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>shaderF</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createShader</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>FRAGMENT_SHADER</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>shaderSource</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>,</span> <span>sourceF</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>compileShader</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderParameter</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILE_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to compile fragment shader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, both the vertex and fragment shader are linked into a single OpenGL program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>program</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createProgram</span><span>();</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>attachShader</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>shaderV</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>attachShader</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>shaderF</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>linkProgram</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getProgramParameter</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>LINK_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getProgramInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to link program</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>useProgram</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We tell the GPU that the shaders we defined above are the ones we want to run. So, now what’s left is to create the inputs and let the GPU loose on those inputs.</p>

<h2 id="send-the-input-data-to-the-gpu">Send the input data to the GPU</h2>

<p>The input data will be stored in the GPU’s memory and processed from there. Instead of making separate draw calls for each piece of input, which would transfer the relevant data one piece at a time, the entire input is transferred to the GPU and read from there. (Legacy OpenGL would transfer data one piece at at time, leading to worse performance.)</p>

<p>OpenGL provides an abstraction known as a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO). I’m still figuring out how all of this works, but ultimately, we’ll do the following using the abstraction:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Store a sequence of bytes in the CPU’s memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transfer the bytes to the GPU’s memory using a unique buffer created using <code>gl.createBuffer()</code> and a <em>binding point</em> of <code>gl.ARRAY_BUFFER</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll have one VBO per input variable (attribute) in the vertex shader, though it’s possible to use a single VBO for multiple inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>positionsData</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Float32Array</span><span>([</span>
  <span>-</span><span>0.75</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>0.75</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>0</span>   <span>,</span>  <span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
<span>]);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createBuffer</span><span>();</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bindBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>ARRAY_BUFFER</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bufferData</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>ARRAY_BUFFER</span><span>,</span> <span>positionsData</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>STATIC_DRAW</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Typically, you’ll specify your geometry with whatever coordinates are meaningful to your application, then use a series of transformations in the vertex shader to get them into OpenGL’s <em>clip space</em>. I won’t go into the details of clip space (they have to do with homogeneous coordinates), but for now, X and Y vary from -1 to +1. Because our vertex shader just passes along the input data as is, we can specify our coordinates directly in clip space.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll also associate the buffer with one of the variables in the vertex shader. Here, we:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get a handle to the <code>position</code> variable from the program we created above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell OpenGL to read data from the <code>gl.ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding point, in batches of 3, with particular parameters like an offset and stride of zero.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>attribute</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribLocation</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>position</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>enableVertexAttribArray</span><span>(</span><span>attribute</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>vertexAttribPointer</span><span>(</span><span>attribute</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we can create the VBO and associate it with the vertex shader attribute this way because we do both one after another. If we separated these two functions (for example creating all the VBOs in one go, then associating them to individual attributes), we would need to call <code>gl.bindBuffer(...)</code> before associating each VBO with its corresponding attribute.</p>

<h2 id="draw">Draw!</h2>

<p>Finally, with all the data in the GPU’s memory set up the way we want, we can tell OpenGL to clear the screen and run the program on the arrays we set up. As part of the rasterization (determining which pixels are covered by the vertices), we tell OpenGL to treat the vertices in groups of 3 as triangles.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>clear</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>drawArrays</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TRIANGLES</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The way we’ve set this up in a linear fashion does mean the program runs in one shot. In any practical application, we’d store the data in a structured way, send it to the GPU whenever it changes, and perform the drawing every frame.</p>

<hr>

<p>Putting everything together, the diagram below shows the minimal set of concepts that go into showing your first triangle on the screen. Even then, the diagram is heavily simplified, so your best bet is to put together the 75 lines of code presented in this article and study that.</p>

  <figcaption>The final, though heavily simplified, sequence of steps needed to show the coveted triangle</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The hard part of learning OpenGL for me has been the sheer amount of boilerplate needed to get the most basic image on the screen. Because the rasterization framework requires us to provide 3D rendering functionality, and communicating with the GPU is verbose, there are many concepts to learn right up front. I hope this article shows the basics are simpler than other tutorials make them out to be!</p>

The promise of blockchain is huge. And large companies are continuing to hire and expand their blockchain teams, incl. Facebook, Amazon, Microsft, EY, Deloitte, IBM, and Oracle, to name a few. So, it should be well worth the effort to become familiar with how blockchain works, what its perceived benefits are, and as a developer starting building on top of them. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, I’ve been helping and on-boarding new team members and developers into the blockchain space. This helped me to collect blogs, links, materials, and resources and see which worked well for everyone’s learning journey. It’s time to share that with a broader audience. This guide provides a starting point for developers who’re keen to learn more about blockchain and development on top of Ethereum. It will be opinionated and not contain a full list of everything available. But rather, a concise list of highly recommended options, from my own experiences. </p>

<p>The Ethereum portal covers sections per programming language, to help you filter out what’s relevant for you. Though JavaScript is most commonly used, I’d start with something that you’re already familiar with, to flatten the learning curve. Use the above only for future reference. As mentioned previously, I’m trying to keep it simple and offer a few recommended options, from my own experiences.

<p>Above should cover everything you need to write your own smart contracts and build decentralized applications on top of Ethereum. </p>

<p>The goal of this guide is mainly to help new developers to enter the space and I won’t go into much depth on advanced topics, such as design &amp; architecture, scalability, privacy, etc.</p>
<p>But a few pointers, for those who feel up to it. </p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The following diagram is a stack representation of the enterprise Ethereum architecture. While this is aimed towards enterprises, it gives a good overview of the relationship between components and can be part of any implementation. </p>

<p>As you can see in the diagram, we’ve covered most from the application layer to the tooling, core blockchain, and networking layer. What’s missing really are the Enterprise 3 P’s.</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Permissioning</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this does not only apply to enterprise but applies to any Ethereum application. I’ll leave these for a future blog post.</p>

<p>This is particularly frustrating as the Concorde ‘B’ model was already designed and the engines were available for incorporation into the next airframe number 217.</p>



<p>This was the aircraft the airlines really needed and the aircraft the manufacturers wanted to build. Unfortunately political pressure intervened and the will to proceed with it simply evaporated.</p>



<p>The new engine (the Olympus 610 +25%) had, as its name suggests, more thrust and eliminated noisy, fuel-guzzling afterburners.</p>



<p>The wing was redesigned, had leading edge ‘droop’ and carried more fuel. With better lift/drag, specific fuel consumption and more fuel the range of the Concorde Model ‘B’ increased over the original Concorde ‘A’ Model.</p>
</div><div data-packed="false" data-vertical-text="false" id="i2kylena"><p>Just four months after Concorde began her scheduled services in 1976, a Concorde ‘B’ model was first discussed and designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds.</p>

<p>It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.This would have given 500&nbsp;mi (805 km) additional range even with greater payload, and would have made new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.</p>



<p>During 1976 Jacques Mitterrand, the Chairman and Managing Director of Aerospatiale, submitted a proposal to investigate an improved version of Concorde – the “Version B” to Mr. Cavaille, French Secretary of State to Transport a similar letter was submitted to the British government at that time.</p>



<p>The letter that he sent elaborated on the quality of the work which had been carried out and the know-how that had now been acquired by the four French and British engineering companies (Aerospatiale, BAe, Rolls Royce and SNECMA). In this letter he also stressed the importance of the role that the manufacturers of Concorde could have in the development of a second-generation supersonic aircraft, that would be foreseeable during the 1990’s, could lead to probably in some form of a collaboration between Europe and the United States.</p>



<p>An exploratory study was actually already underway during this time, looking into upgrading the capabilities of the current Concorde design for the early 1980’s. The letter submitted also gave the official go ahead for this exploratory study and proposed a full feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.</p>



<p>Due to the manufactures having great difficulty selling the remaining five Concorde airframes that were built during the initial production run, Concorde 216 (G-BOAF) was to be the last Concorde ‘A’ built, and 217 was planned to be a Concorde ‘B’ version. Had Concorde ‘B’ been built, what type of future would we be living in now? If the additional range and performance had been available then many more airlines might have purchased Concorde and passenger air travel as we know it today might have been completely different.</p>



<p>She was planned to have a range approaching and even exceeding 5000 miles. But it is easy to imagine the potential range of Concorde ‘B’ design, when you consider that the Concorde “A” model used by British Airways had a design specification range of 3690 miles, had to regularly fly 4250 miles on a route between London Heathrow and Barbados. This was made possible due to operational improvements that pushed the range of Concorde ‘A’ to nearly 4500 miles. The improvements have included small changes to the aerodynamics of the original model’s specifications. One interesting fact is that the take-off weight was made very low and close to the figures estimated for the Concorde ‘B’ design.</p>



<p>The Concorde ‘B’ design would of also benefited from increased subsonic performance and reduced noise emissions.</p>

<p>The cost of the Concorde Project was massive and with the poor sales of Concorde, and cancelled options from airlines, adding to that the rising cost of aviation fuel during the 1970s, the development of the Model ‘B’ version was considered too expensive and cancelled. Although the study carried out was a pretty comprehensive one and could of given Concorde a real future in during the years to come right into the 1990s and even on into the 2000s, after this time it was generally expected that a new generation SST with a new type of variable cycle engines would enter into service (BAe AST3 or Aerospatiale Alliance)</p>



<h3>Exploratory and feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.</h3>



<p>The study into a Concorde ‘B’ design had two aims:</p>



<p>1. To ensure the expansion and future demand for supersonic transport (SST), where the Anglo-French group was now and into the future as the main and only player,</p>



<p>2. To maintain the high knowledge level gained by the manufacturers in Britain and France, and to provide a solid position for the participation in a future program of a second-generation SST.</p>





<p>This feasibility study, was planned to last 9 months and was estimated to cost 9 million French francs, it was to comprise three areas:</p>



<p>1. Engineering</p>



<p>2. Development costs</p>



<p>3. Markets</p>



<p>If this exploratory and feasibility study was to confirmed an economic interest for the manufacturers, and then led to the decision of the launch of an improved version of Concorde, such an improved version (allowing for a 5 year development programme) could be ready by spring 1982 for the 17th production Concorde 217</p>



<p>Civil aviation history shows that almost all new aircraft constituted a base point for the start of improved versions (The Boeing 747-100 evolved into today’s 747-400) and at this stage this was the plan for the Concorde program.</p>



<p>The interest in this development process would have been beneficial to both the airlines and the manufacturers of Concorde:</p>



<p>1. For the airlines, it would have offered performance improvements (lower direct operation costs, extension of the operating range, and reduction of environmental effects) while conserving the existing investments in crew training, maintenance procedures, etc.</p>



<p>2. For the manufacturers, it would have made it possible to carry out these improvements at a minimum capital cost. Indeed the development of the initial production version generally revealed aerodynamic areas where gains could be made along with structural margins, but these could not be exploited due to the time constraints in getting Concorde into passenger service successfully.</p>



<p>3. If the decision to build the B model would have been taken, the modifications would have been relatively inexpensive as they were just some minor changes to the existing production process, allowing the majority of the tooling to be maintained. The high level of knowledge that was gained during the certification of the current model would have greatly reduced time and costs during the certification of the B model.</p>



<p>These considerations should have applied particularly to the case of Concorde, considering the exceptional degree of innovation obtained and the great amount of technical knowledge accumulated during the twelve years of development of the initial production version.</p>



<p>The broad objectives of the Concorde ‘B’ version were to ensure the expansion of the network of routes that supersonic aircraft could use.</p>



<p>The following improvements were considered to be necessary:</p>



<h3>The Reduction of&nbsp; harmful acoustic effects on the airport environment:</h3>



<p>Although the level of noise produced by Concorde at takeoff and landing is equivalent to that of the first generation long haul aircraft in service (B 707, DC8), only the second generation of long haul aircraft (B747, DC10, L1011) equipped with high-bypass jet engines satisfied the new international noise rules.

They allow you to link a remote database to PostgreSQL and represent it as a set of foreign tables that behave like normal ones.</p><p>Imagine being able to run SQL on a MongoDB collection or querying MySQL data from your PostgreSQL instance. Or, imagine running a <code>JOIN</code> between an SQLite file and an Oracle cluster without having to write and maintain an ETL job.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss PostgreSQL foreign data wrappers and how <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/">Splitgraph</a> makes it much easier for anyone to use them.</p></section><section><h2 id="using-a-custom-fdw-with-splitgraph">Using a custom FDW with Splitgraph</h2><p>This example (<a href="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw" as="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw">source code on GitHub</a>) will show you how to write a custom <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">foreign data wrapper</a> using Multicorn. <a href="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn" as="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn">Multicorn</a> is a PostgreSQL extension that makes it possible to write foreign data wrappers in Python.</p><p>We will then integrate it with Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command.

</span></code></pre></section></section><section><h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers">What are foreign data wrappers?</h2><p>The easiest way to describe foreign data wrappers is by considering UNIX files. A UNIX file isn't always pointing to a local file on your disk. It could be a file stored on NFS, in a remote S3 bucket or even a shim that lets you manipulate a device on your machine.</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a pretty strong abstraction that doesn't get broken. An IDE doesn't need to know that the file it's editing is on a remote filesystem. It can work with it by issuing the same ordinary read and write calls. Someone who writes a new filesystem doesn't need to make sure that it's compatible with all existing tools. Instead, they can write a driver that mounts the filesystem to a mountpoint.</p><p>PostgreSQL FDWs resemble mounting in that respect. Foreign tables mostly behave like normal tables and can receive the same <code>SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE</code> queries. Behind the scenes, the wrapper's only job is to emit tuples.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-should-i-use-fdws">Why should I use FDWs?</h2><p>Foreign data wrappers are a great alternative to ETL. Instead of loading data into your warehouse that you might never use, you can mount the remote database and query it on demand.</p><p>Because they integrate with the PostgreSQL query planner, FDWs have a decent performance. The FDW can push down qualifiers and even aggregations to the remote database. FDWs can report the rough costs of starting a scan and fetching a tuple back to the query planner. This lets the query planner choose, for example, whether running multiple small single scans or one big one is a better strategy for satisfying a JOIN.</p><p>It's straightforward to write your own FDW and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html" as="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> covers it extensively. The <a href="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/" as="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/">hello-world FDW</a> that returns "Hello, World" in a table is only a couple hundred lines of C code. If you prefer to focus on development simplicity, you can use Multicorn instead of raw C.</p><p>There are plenty of open-source foreign data wrappers available. They let you query other RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, CSV files or column stores.

<p>Bashing the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seems to have become one of American activists’ favourite hobbies in the tech field. Some criticism is entirely justified. But many claims that the GDPR is “counterproductive” or “misses the point” are based on misconceptions, rather than an accurate understanding of European data protection laws.</p>
<p>As a result, several US privacy advocates have therefore suggested alternative principles or rules… many of which, actually, have been part of EU data protection law since 1995.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/hugoroyd/status/1246024493144911873">as promised</a>, here is:</p>
<p><strong>The GDPR as accidentally explained by people in the US who criticize the GDPR for its pitfalls, while calling for what’s actually in the GDPR</strong></p>
<p>If you have other examples to illustrate this, let me know so I can add them to this post. I may update this post from time to time, so <a href="https://hroy.eu/tags/gdprExplainedByUS/index.atom">subscribe to the feed</a> to get notified!</p>
<p><em>A short note:</em> My intention with this post is to help you, my reader from the US or elsewhere, understand better what’s actually in the GDPR. I have great respect for many of the people mentioned below (some of whom I consider or have considered personal heroes). I hope they are fine with a bit of teasing ;-)</p>
<h2 id="collection">1. The problem starts not with “data use” but with “data collection”</h2>
<h3 id="snowdenwu">Edward Snowden and Tim Wu (November 2019)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowden also directed some criticism at data privacy authorities that have tried to step up regulation on companies over how they handle user data. He said the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation […] “misplaces the problem.”</p>
<p>“The problem isn’t data protection, the problem is data collection,” Snowden said. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/edward-snowden-warns-about-data-collection-surveillance-at-web-summit.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Edward Snowden said this at the Web Summit: “I think GDPR is not the solution, but the problem is with data collection not data use. It gives a false sensation of reassurance.” What are your thoughts on this?</em></p>
<p>[Tim Wu:] I think he has a point…that’s what my criticism of GDPR is. It doesn’t actually stop anyone from doing anything. Collect all you want…and I think that’s where the problem starts. I think he’s onto something. <a href="https://gdpr.report/news/2019/11/18/privsecny-tim-wu-on-gdpr-and-data-privacy-practices-in-the-us/">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edward Snowden and Tim Wu argue that regulations on data use are not sufficient to protect people. For them, a good regulation should start with data collection.</p>
<p>That is why, since 1995<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, EU data protection law regulates not only data use, but also the collection of personal data.</p>
<p>More specifically, the GDPR covers the processing of personal data. Processing is defined in the GDPR as “<em>any operation</em>” performed on personal data. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1489-1-1">Article 4(2) of the GDPR</a> includes data “<em>collection</em>” explicitly.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)</a> sets the principle of “<em>data minimisation</em>”, and also provides that personal data must be “<em>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</em>.”</p>
<p>If personal data is collected in breach of these rules, the company responsible for the infringement may be fined up to 4 % of their global annual turnover (or EUR 20,000,000 if higher). Authorities may also order the company to destroy the data collected in breach – regardless of whether the data was ever used or not.</p>
<h3 id="richard-stallman-april-2018-or-december-2019">Richard Stallman (April 2018 or December 2019)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many ways to use data to hurt people that the only safe database is the one that was never collected. Thus, instead of the EU’s approach (in the GDPR) of mainly regulating how personal data may be used, I propose a law to stop systems from collecting personal data.</p>
<p>The robust way to do that, the way that can’t be set aside at the whim of a government, is to require systems to be built so as not to collect data about persons. The basic principle is that a system must be designed not to collect certain data, if its basic function can be carried out without that data. Improving efficiency must explicitly not count as a justification for collecting more data. <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/real-privacy-laws.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Stallman argues that laws must prohibit data collection if it is not necessary or not justified, and that systems must be designed not to collect certain data.</p>
<p>That is why, since 1995, EU data protection law regulates not only data use, but also the collection of personal data (see <a href="#snowdenwu">above</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, since 2018, the GDPR has extended the set of rules with the principles of data protection “by design” and “by default”.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e3063-1-1">Article 25</a> provides, specifically, that systems must be designed to implement data minimisation effectively. In addition, technical and organisational measures must by default ensure that “<em>only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected […].</em>”</p>
<p>One last bit: Richard Stallman argues that “improving efficiency” of a system must not be a justification for collecting personal data.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)</a> already provides that personal data must be “<em>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</em>.” Therefore, it seems that Richard Stallman’s interpretation of this principle means that “improving efficiency” may never be considered legitimate. Do you agree?</p>
<h2 id="consent">2. Individuals’ consent is not the right approach for privacy</h2>
<h3 id="maciej">Maciej Cegłowski (April 2020)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The European approach to privacy legislation has been to add layers of complexity, based on a kabuki dance of individual consent, where all that is needed are some strong legal limits on what data can be collected and how long it can be stored. <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1245699326522712064">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maciej argues that basing privacy legislation on individual consent is not the right approach and, instead, regulations should provide strong legal limits on data collection and data retention.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That is why, since 1995, individual consent is only <em>one</em> among six legal bases that allow lawful collection of personal data. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">Article 6</a> of the GDPR requires at least one of six legal bases to be applicable. In many circumstances, “consent” is not considered as an adequate basis (e.g.&nbsp;in employee-employer relationships).</p>
<p><span id="consent-conditions">Even where consent may be considered adequate, it must fulfil strong conditions: to be a “<em>freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication</em>” of agreement expressed “<em>by a statement or by a clear affirmative action.</em>” (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1489-1-1">Article 4(11)</a>)</span></p>
<p>If you thought that it’s sufficient to obtain consent to anything by checking a box to read and agree to the terms of service, or that merely browsing a website meant accepting cookies — you’ve been misled by the kabuki dance of people who wished the GDPR was centered around weak individual consent. In spite of GDPR strengthening conditions for consent, the online ad and tracking industry is still trying with their complex cookie banners and settings!</p>
<p>And, where sensitive data is concerned:</p>
<ul>
<li>collection is prohibited as a general rule,</li>
<li>unless explicit consent has been obtained and no EU or national laws rule out consent<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, or</li>
<li>unless one of the nine other exemptions listed in Article 9(2) applies (many of which require a EU or national law).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the GDPR provides the principle of “<em>storage limitation</em>” in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)(c)</a>.</p>
<p>Pursuant to this principle, personal data must be “<em>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed</em>” i.e.&nbsp;when data is not necessary any more, it must be destroyed or anonymized.</p>
<p>The GDPR allows, however, for retaining data longer, in particular for archival, research or statistical purposes - subject to certain conditions (see Article 5 and Article 89 among others).</p></li>
<li><p>For the argument on data <a href="#collection">collection</a>, see above.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To be entirely fair, and exhaustive — specific regulations may provide otherwise. The GDPR as its title suggests, is a “general” body of law. In certain circumstances, specific rules may contravene the general principles stated above. For instance, since 2009, the “EU cookie directive” (which modifies the “ePrivacy Directive” of 2002) requires consent as the <em>only</em> available basis for storing information or identifiers on a user’s device, or for accessing such stored information. There are, however, some exceptions, i.e.&nbsp;if necessary to provide services expressly requested…</small></p>
<h3 id="richard-stallman-april-2018-or-december-2019-1">Richard Stallman (April 2018 or December 2019)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The EU’s GDPR regulation is well-meant, but does not go very far. It will not deliver much privacy because its rules are too lax. They permit collecting any data if it is somehow useful to the system, and it is easy to come up with a way to make any particular data useful for something.</p>
<p>The GDPR makes much of requiring users (in some cases) to give consent for collection of their data, but that doesn’t do much good. System designers have become expert at manufacturing consent (to repurpose Chomsky’s phrase). Most users consent to a site’s terms without reading them; a company that required users to trade their first-born child got consent from plenty of users. Then again, when a system is crucial for modern life, like buses and trains, users ignore the terms because refusal of consent is too painful to consider.</p>
<p>To restore privacy, we must stop surveillance before it even asks for consent. <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/real-privacy-laws.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Stallman argues that it is too easy to trick users into consenting to the collection of their data, and that is it too easy to claim that data is “somehow useful”. Instead, we should stop surveillance before it even asks for consent.</p>
<p>That is why, under EU data protection laws:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where individual consent is an adequate legal basis (which is not always the case), the GDPR puts strong legal conditions on what valid consent requires (see <a href="#consent-conditions">above</a>), so it cannot be considered “easy” to trick people into giving consent.</p></li>
<li><p>Where data is collected and used in connection with a contract (e.g.&nbsp;terms and conditions of an online service), only data that is “<em>necessary</em>” may be lawfully processed.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">Article 6</a> provides that processing in that context must be “<em>necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract</em>” — it is, therefore, not sufficient to consider that the data is “somehow useful”.</p></li>

<div>
<p>… or it took a while to get here 😀</p>
<h4>Origins</h4>
<p>This project is fully lead by Willy/Lamers with my minor participation.</p>
<p>It all started with an idea to create the most convenient modern USB mouse adapter for as many retro machines as possible.</p>
<p>Willy started working on it in his spare-time six years ago. The project goals were simple.</p>
<ul><li>small, smooth and not expensive design</li><li>reliable</li><li>quadrature encoder mouse support</li><li>easy to use and maintain</li><li>easy to personalize/configure</li><li>quick firmware upgrade</li></ul>
<p>The project came about quite quickly and Willy ordered the first batch. Unfortunately, It met almost all conditions but one – reliability. The design was based on the FTDI Vinculum2 chip. Although the layout is not bad, the toolchain is terribly underdeveloped (at least it was at that time). There were memory leaks all over the place, debugging was almost impossible, mainly due to the processor for which there is no documentation. In addition, the configuration saved from time to time destroyed the config itself …<br>It was too much. The project has been abandoned. If you are a strong-willed person you can try it yourself. All work that was done on it, is accessible <a href="http://jil.guru/16bit/projects/abbannddonnedd/hid2st.rar">HERE</a>. You can view or use it if you have the energy to break through the unfinished, wrong and undocumented code</p>
<h4>The new hope</h4>
<p>In the meantime, the design was repeatedly unearthed from a drawer, but unfortunately without much effect. Some of the original goals turned out to be impossible to fulfill.</p>
<p>Up to <a href="http://sillyventure.eu/pl/">Silly Venture 2019</a> which turned out to be a breakthrough. the demand for a functional Atari ST adapter turned out to be quite large. The mouSTer project was born.</p>
<p>The project received a new name “The mouSTer” and <a href="http://www.ha.art.pl/wydawnictwo/autorzy/5334-piotr-kroll-mietniowski.html">Kroll</a> (translator required) became its godfather. I hope he doesn’t mind :). Kroll is the best tester of an Atari equipment around.</p>
<p>The project has gained a new shape and new strengths.</p>
<p>Some early prototype pics:</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/j2aoKg8.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/j2aoKg8.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>At the moment, the current size has been reduced to a minimum – DB9 plug size + USB-A socket</p>
<p>Below some highlights:</p>
<ul><li>it works with every mouse and with every Game USB pad</li><li>PS4 pad support – USB </li><li>config via USB flash drive – INI file + default config</li><li>config transfer via USB flash drive</li><li>firmware upgrade via USB flash drive (takes 3 seconds, of which 2 seconds is the time the bootloader needs to recognize the flash drive)</li><li>tested with flash drives from 32MB to 32GB</li><li>mouse emulation mode defaults – Amiga, Atari ST, joystick/gamepad</li></ul>
<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>Finally, after a few months of testing in laboratory conditions, everything works rock-solid. Changing the firmware and configuration works confidently and is trouble-free.</p>

<p><br>What’s left to be done<mark id="annotation-text-c72ef339-eeed-462d-a5c9-61b4fb1fb90d"></mark>:</p>
<ul><li>making a test batch in the target size – closing the plant due to COVID19 did not help at all 🙁</li><li>configuration file tuning</li><li>creating a poly-urethane case</li><li>adding config options for Commodore 64/128, Spectrum, and every other possible retro machine.</li><li>PS4 pad full support for all platforms.</li><li>8-bit Atari will receive a special mode that will cover all the PS4 pad functions, mouse and other HID class devices</li><li>testing, testing, testing …</li></ul>
<p><strong>What has to be highlighted is that mouSTer started as an ATARI add-on but it aims to be multi-platform adapter!!</strong></p>

		<p>I have a confession to make: I can’t eat spicy food.</p>
<p>As a person of South Asian descent, it’s incongruous, I know. I’m left adrift with the certain type of person who orders food Indian spicy. While my dining companions make an effort to signal their identity as capsaicin-consuming, I wonder if I should order my food white-guy mild. It’s not like I don’t enjoy the stinging heat or the bleary-eyed trip of something made extra hot—it’s just that I can’t digest it.</p>

<p>I blame dysentery. A bout of it when I was three left two lasting effects on my life: it introduced me to my oldest friendship through a circuitous game of chance (a story for another time), and it rendered my digestive system subject to pains that feel like someone is reaching into me to wring out my guts like wet laundry.</p>
<p>I’m often told by well-meaning people how much they love Indian food, and then asked if I cook it at home. I never know quite how to respond. Does roti count—especially if it’s the buss-up shut <i>parāthā</i> of Trinidad? Where do Bihari staples like <i>sattū</i> (ground-up roasted gram) or <i>chōkha</i> (mashed and roasted eggplant) fit into this understanding? But their question isn’t an interrogation of the narrowness of national cuisines. Their question isn’t a question at all—it’s a chance to share. The woman who loves her corner Indian restaurant. The man who just took an Indian-cooking class through adult education. The reasons are usually the same: they love the heat, the fieriness, the spice.</p>
<p>All the things I’m doomed to avoid.</p>

<p>This all had me wondering: what’s Indian food without the heat? The historian in me has an answer: spiciness is historically contingent. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and the entire world changed: slavery, war, disease, colonization, and an immense transfer of wealth to Europe. And with that wealth too came New World nightshades—potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, peppers of all kinds. It took some time for these fruits and vegetables to plant themselves into European cuisine. The tomato, for example, wasn’t widely used in Italian cuisine until the eighteenth century.<span id="easy-footnote-1-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-69820" title="David Gentilecore, <i>Pomodoro! A History of the Tomato in Italy</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 45–68."><sup>1</sup></a></span> But what about food further out from Europe? What about India?</p>
<p>Soon after Columbus’ first expedition, the treaties of Tordesillas and Saragossa divided the oceans of the newly-known world. The Portuguese effectively took the Atlantic and Indian oceans, while the Spanish took the Pacific. With that, the Portuguese established forts and trading posts along India’s Malabar coast. In time, <i>aloo</i> (potato), <i>tamātar</i> (tomato), and <i>mirchī</i> (chilies) were available on the western coast of the Indian subcontinent. Later, the English set up their first trading posts in India in the eastern Gangetic plain, bringing these same staples into North India.<span id="easy-footnote-2-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-69820" title="K.T. Achaya, <i>Indian Food: A Historical Companion</i> (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998), 225–27."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>So what was curry like before Columbus? Well, <i>curry</i> didn’t exist.</p>
<p>In these cases, I find it useful to consult my <i>Hobson-Jobson</i>, the nineteenth-century dictionary of Anglo-Indian loan words. According to that source, curry comes from the Portuguese word <i>karil (caril)</i> via the Tamil word <i>kari</i> (sauce, relish for rice). In the sixteenth century, this was transliterated into English as caril, but by the 1680s entered English as <i>carrees</i>, perhaps from <i>caris</i>, an Anglicized plural form of the Portuguese.<span id="easy-footnote-3-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-69820" title="Sir Henry Yule, “Curry,” in <a href=&quot;https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/hobsonjobson_query.py?page=281&quot;><i>Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive</i></a>, ed. William Crooke, B.A (London: J Murray, 1903), 281."><sup>3</sup></a></span> It’s a circle: I’m back to Tordesillas and Saragossa.</p>
<p>It looks like the curry too came after Columbus. And not only that: it’s a meaningless word in the context of daily life. Indian food is cipher, built upon a matrix of regionalism, religion, and caste. A Dalit from Mararashtra’s Marathwada region might mix bovine blood with <i>yesur</i> (a local spice mix) to make <i>lakuti</i>, while a Tamil Brahmin might mix eight spices with <i>tur dāl</i> and onions to make a <i>sambar</i>.<span id="easy-footnote-4-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-69820" title="Shahu Patole, <a href=&quot;http://www.expressfoodie.com/main-course/why-i-wrote-a-book-on-dalit-food/&quot;>“Why I Wrote a Book on Dalit Food,”</a> <i>Express Foodie</i>, September 10, 2016."><sup>4</sup></a></span> Beyond the hyper-regionalism is a blunt truth as well: there are actual words for the plethora of regional dishes that can be reduced to a curry.</p>
<p>Still, curry can be a somewhat useful concept. It’s an outsider’s perspective, a shorthand glossing over an entire subcontinent’s worth of food. It’s the type of concept that takes what it wants from the original, and mixes in whatever else is ready-to-hand.</p>
<p>I went to the source: the first example of a curry recipe found in a Western cookbook. Hannah Glasse’s 1747 <i>The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</i> featured a recipe “To make a Currey the Indian way” alongside one “To make a Pellow the Indian way.”<span id="easy-footnote-5-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-69820" title="Hannah Glasse, <i>The Art of Cookery, New</i> (London: L. Wangford, 1777), 74."><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="771" height="372" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1 771w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=336%2C162&amp;ssl=1 336w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=768%2C370&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1536%2C741&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=2048%2C987&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1170%2C564&amp;ssl=1 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Upon first glance, I can’t tell how this recipe differs from a fricasseed chicken. But it’s there: “an ounce of Turmerick [turmeric], a large spoonful of ginger and beaten pepper.” What makes this curry in an Indian way is not the chicken or the cream, but these three spices taken mixed together and served.</p>
<p>Before spicy came spice: the history of curry before Columbus is a history of spice. And so I wonder: what spices were used? In what quantities?</p>
<p>The best spice to help answer these questions might be asafetida (also spelled asafetida). Known in Hindi as <i>hīng</i>, it’s the dried resin taken from the root of the Ferula herb, and is used throughout Indian cuisine in nearly all Indian regions. When fried in oil, it adds a lovely umami flavor to any dish, one reminiscent of garlic or onions.</p>
<p>I’ve also known it as an extremely smelly spice.</p>

<p>I had never heard of it until I was an adult. Family lore says that my father hated the smell so much, he told my mother early in their marriage to keep it out of the spice cabinet forever. But it wasn’t just him—the smell has a noxious reputation across the world, going back centuries. The Portuguese physician and naturalist Garcia de Orta wrote in his sixteenth-century <i>Colóquios</i> that “the nastiest smell in the world for me is Assa-fetida [sic].” But he also wrote that “the thing most used throughout India, and in all parts of it, is that Assa-fetida.”<span id="easy-footnote-6-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-69820" title="Garcia da Orta, <i>Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India</i>, ed. Conde de Ficalho, trans. Sir Clements Markham, New Lisbon Edition (London: Henry Sotheran and Co, 1913), 44–45."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This was as true in the twelfth century as it was in the sixteenth. One of the earliest South Asian texts that featured non-medicinal recipes was the Sanskrit <i>Mānasollāsa</i>. Written in 1129 CE by Someshvara III, king of the Western Chalukya Empire in the western Deccan and South India, the book is an encyclopedic treatise on all aspects of life in his kingdom. One of those most common ingredients found in its chapter on the enjoyment of food is asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-7-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-69820" title="Colleen Taylor Sen, <i>Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India</i>, Overdrive (eBook) edition (London: Reaktion Books, 2015), chap. 7."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
<p>For example, his general practices or preparing meat dishes called for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>For getting good smell, dry coriander seeds, jeera, and hingu; for giving colour haridra; for good taste the powder of saindhvam, visvamarichim are sprinkled over the food and covered with a clean cloth and mixed slightly with oil.<span id="easy-footnote-8-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-69820" title="P. Arundhati, trans., <i>Royal Life in Mānasôllāsa</i> (New Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan, 1994), 120."><sup>8</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Various other recipes, including those for <i>dāl</i>, meat dishes, and fish were also spiced with asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-9-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>9</sup></a></span> My first inclination when I saw this was to question it: of course a king would spice his food. Spices were a luxury, and it goes without saying that a king could afford to command his kitchen to use whatever spices were available to him.</p>

<p>But a century prior to the publication of the <i>Mānasollāsa</i> came the <i>Lokopakara</i> (roughly translates to “For the benefit of the people”). Written in 1025 by the Jain scholar Chavundaraya II, the<i> Lokopakara</i> featured a section on cooking with a recipe for <i>dāl </i>that recommended a garnish of mustard, cumin seeds, asafetida, and curry leaves.<span id="easy-footnote-10-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Asafetida too made an appearance in recipes dating from the Sultanate era. From 1206 to 1526, a succession of Islamic dynasties known as the Delhi Sultanate ruled northern India. Nasir ud-Din Shah, a ruler of the Malwa Sultanate (a breakaway state from one of the Delhi Sultanate dynasties) produced the <i>Ni’matnama</i> (“The Book of Delights”). The book contained some of the recipes loved by his father, the Sultan Ghiyath Shah. Interestingly enough, the book contains a handful of recipes considered rustic or common—food for the common folk.</p>
<p>One recommends to:</p>
<blockquote><p>take root vegetables and boil them well, then take them off and fry them in ghee flavoured with sesame and asafetida.</p>
<p>Add lime juice, salt and burned vegetable oil and mix it as explained above. Take some of it, flavor it and cook it.<span id="easy-footnote-11-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-69820" title="Norah M. Titley, ed., <i>The Ni’matnama Manuscript of the Sultans of Mandu: The Sultan’s Book of Delights</i> (London: Routledge, 2004), 44–45."><sup>11</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure how burned vegetable oil would taste, but I’m sure the asafetida would make up for it. Maybe.</p>
<p>Humble <i>hīng</i> too made an appearance in the royal accounts of the Mughals. The Mughal Emperor Akbar reigned from 1556 to 1605. His court historian, Abu’l-Fazl ‘Allami, dutifully chronicled his reign in <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> (“Administration of Akbar”). The work remains a quintessential source for the workings of Akbar’s government. It also contains a repertoire of recipes. For example, a recipe for <i>bādinjān</i> (eggplant) asks for:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 s. [<i>sīr</i>, approximately 640 grams] rice; 1 ½ s. g’hí [ghee], 3 ¾ s. onions; ¼ s. ginger and lime juice; pepper and coriander seed, 5 m. [misqal, approximately 6 grams] of each; cloves, cardamums [cardamom], and assafoetida, each ½ m.<span id="easy-footnote-12-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-69820" title="Abu’l-Fazl ’Allami, <i>The Ain I Akbari</i>, trans. Henry Blochmann, vol. 1 (Calcutta: Rouse, 1873), 59."><sup>12</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Strangely enough, the recipe for eggplant lacks any mention of eggplant. But regardless, there it is: a half <i>misqal</i> of asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-13-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-69820" title="A unit of mass equal to 4.25 grams. Misqal is sometimes written as mithqāl."><sup>13</sup></a></span> Even the kitchens of the Mughal court were filled with the wondrous odors of <i>hīng</i>.</p>
<p>The history of curry before Columbus is truly a history of spice. There are, of course, more spices to find in the archives: turmeric, coriander, and cumin come to mind. These are spices that cross region and class, the staples thrown into the pot in meal after meal. But ubiquitous, smelly, resinous <i>hīng</i> gives a chance to take a peek into the flavors of Indian food prior to the Columbian exchange. Perhaps there should be a new way to order something, not Indian spicy, but Indian spiced, with plenty of asafetida. I’ll hold my nose and ask for a generous portion, just like all those food chroniclers over the past millennium.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 2006, Robert Andersen sent <a href="https://twitter.com/rsa/status/55281">the first tweet that @mentioned another user</a>, and an internet convention was born.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a tweet reading &quot;@ buzz - you broke your thumb and youre still twittering? that's some serious devotion&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_1.png"></p>
<p>In a world without smartphones, Twitter’s primary interface was SMS. There were no threads, no @username autocomplete. If a user said something and you wanted to reply, your only option was to compose a new text to 40404, manually typing the @mention into your phone’s SMS text box. SMS was also the origin of Twitter’s original <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/counting-characters">140 character</a> limit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter began as an SMS text-based service. This limited the original Tweet length to 140 characters (which was partly driven by the 160 character limit of SMS, with 20 characters reserved for commands and usernames).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also a holdover from the SMS days, Twitter does not allow any formatted or rich text. Users today work around this limitation by using the wide array of possibilities that Unicode affords. <a href="https://technastic.com/bold-text-twitter-mobile-web/#List_of_Online_Text_Generators">Text generators</a> convert ASCII characters into 𝔲𝔫𝔲𝔰𝔲𝔞𝔩 𝔘𝔫𝔦𝔠𝔬𝔡𝔢 𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔯𝔞𝔠𝔱𝔢𝔯𝔰. Memes take advantage of repeated spaces to position text, or to draw Unicode houses. (All of that is, of course, completely inaccessible to screen readers.) Emoji modifiers allow expressing a wide range of emotions with modifiers for skin tones and gender.</p>
<p><img alt="two screenshots, one of a unicode house reading &quot;in this house we worship unicode&quot; and another with a tweet from @helllzgirl that say &quot;cashiers 🤝 ariana grande ... thank u, next&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_5.png"></p>
<p>Critically, this “plain” text is fully copy-pastable into any app with Unicode support. While many Twitter users from 2006 were likely limited to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38#GSM_8_bit_data_encoding">GSM-7 encoding</a>, the limitations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)">T9 keyboard</a>, and their phone’s limited text rendering and shaping, modern users have found new ways to express themselves using the full Unicode character space. Nowadays, tweets, names, URLs, hashtags, basically <em>everything</em> can contain Unicode characters. Of course, everything except the @mention.</p>
<p>Usernames on Twitter have more or less the same requirements as during the SMS era — up to 15 letters from <code>a-z</code>, numbers from <code>0-9</code> and the underscore <code>_</code>. This requirement is similar to many other websites: GitHub only allows alphanumeric characters and non-repeating hyphens, and Facebook allows just alphanumeric characters and the period.</p>
<p>As we will see, this limitation is one of several problems with usernames.</p>
<h2>Unicode Usernames</h2>
<p>Imagine if instead of alphanumerics, GitHub allowed usernames to only be made up of the numbers <code>0-9</code> and Chinese characters. It would be pretty frustrating, right? If forced to use a system like this, we would likely ignore the Chinese characters, and just use the numbers as usernames. This is often what happens on social media platforms in countries that don’t use Latin script. In China, the QQ instant messaging service (originally started in 1999) completely got rid of usernames used by similar services like AOL. Instead, each user is assigned a unique number, their QQ ID. This number cannot be chosed by the user, and is immutable. WeChat similarly assigns users a random number when they sign up, although it does allow each user exactly one opportunity to change it to an alphanumeric string of their choice. Typing long numbers isn’t particularly ergonomic, which could help explain the widespread use of QR codes in China.</p>
<p>Even in Latin-speaking countries, AOL-style usernames had issues. By requiring a username when logging in, and <em>also</em> requiring usernames to be unique among all users, users are often forced to use different usernames on different services, creating a second password that they had to memorize. Thankfully, most services have fixed at least this small problem by having login be email- instead of username-based.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, usernames are alphanumeric only. Why can’t we just allow Unicode, so that usernames could contain Chinese, Cyrillic, or other non-Latin alphabets? Unfortunately Unicode usernames have their own issues — just look at the largest username system in the world, the domain name system and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">extension that allowed non-ASCII characters</a>. This was an essential upgrade, and yet it has inperfections, allowing the <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/chrome-firefox-unicode-phishing/">registration of websites</a> such as this one:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of browser window, URL bar reads &quot;epic.com&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_2.png"></p>
<p>This is latest Firefox, as of July 2020, displaying what appears to be “epic.com”, the website of a large healthcare company. However, as you can see, the content is actually some random blog reminding people to drink water. How is this possible? If we stick the code into a Unicode character inspector, we can see what’s going on:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of unicode character inspector revealing &quot;epic&quot; to actually be &quot;еріс&quot;. of course you, a screen reader user, aren't fooled." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_3.png"></p>
<p>Byte-wise, the real “epic.com” and the false website “еріс.com” are completely different. But visually, they’re indistinguishable from each other in the URL bar, allowing phishing problems to run amock. Unicode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonicalization and normalization</a> can help with certain cases of this problem, but does nothing for our epic.com example.</p>
<p>This particular example isn’t visible in Chrome, which instead shows <code>https://xn--e1awd7f.com/</code>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">“punycode”</a> representation of the domain name. This is thanks to Chrome’s complex, <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/76be97d896f266d6b73b2fe0af5d6d479ca31306/docs/idn.md">13 step process</a> for detecting if a domain name is likely to be a Unicode phish or not. “Well, it may be complex,” you tell me, “but at least it solves the phishing problem!” Unfortunately it does not.</p>

<p>Specific instances of IDN homograph attacks have been reported to Chrome, and we continually update our IDN policy to prevent against these attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Unicode spec is apparently too large to solve this problem 100% perfectly, and so their “solution” is to pay $2000 to anybody who finds new edge cases. This also doesn’t actually solve the problem for non-Latin alphabets — if for example, I own a Chinese domain name, it will never show punycode, and attackers can phish my site using duplicate encodings for those Chinese characters. Chrome just attempts to solve the much smaller problem of the numerous Unicode characters that visually look like the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>This is probably frustrating to read, and you may want to point fingers at Unicode, for failing to provide canonical encodings for a series of graphemes. Or perhaps we can blame the domain name registrars, for allowing visually identical registrations. But I think the real culprit here is the incorrect assumption we Latin script users have when we build usernames into our systems. We assume that two visually-identical printed text tokens will have the same bytewise encoding. This is simply not true for a huge portion of computer users, and is a root failing with username-based systems today. The only solution is to develop systems that don’t have usernames.</p>
<p>Even in a trusted system with no bad actors, there is no guarantee a user retyping a non-Latin username from a printed document will end up with the same bytes as the original document.</p>
<h2>Changing Usernames</h2>
<p>Let’s say you’re building a site for English use only, and so even after reading all of this, you think perhaps it’s ok to have usernames. After all, you’ll probably find, like Twitter did, that this makes text entry for @mentions <em>much</em> simpler to implement. You get to use just a plain text field, instead of building an input field that can insert custom @mention objects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you will still run into the issue of somebody <em>changing</em> their username. This is often an extremely complex problem. Take <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-github-username">GitHub</a> for example. Changing your username there will redirect your old repository links to new ones. However, somebody else can come in and use your old username. What happens if they create a repo with the same name as your old one?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the new owner of your old username creates a repository with the same name as your repository, that will override the redirect entry and your redirect will stop working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>URLs aren’t the only place GitHub usernames are used. Using the web interface, in some cases, will create commits with the email <code><a href="https://lord.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f4998d818791869a959991b48187918687da9a9b869184988dda939d809c8196da979b99">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>. These commits will permanantly be disconnected from your account, unless you somehow are able to force push edited commit headers to every repository you’ve ever contributed to. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Instagram has issues with changing usernames, too. Up until 2015, updating your username would cause you to lose all your previous @mentions. They’ve since fixed this; old @mentions eventually update. Twitter supposedly will also preserve your replies, although my testing shows this is an unreliable feature at best. Updating the actual @mention as it’s listed in the Tweet would have other issues, since if a user mentioned in a 280-character tweet adds 5 characters to their username, you’d suddenly get a 285-character tweet. Hope your Twitter clients can all support that.</p>
<p>The final example of username switching pains I have is from my year at Google. I was fortunate enough to never switch my username, perfectly satisfied every morning when I opened my laptop and saw <code><a href="https://lord.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="355954475175525a5a5259501b565a58">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> on the login screen. But countless internal systems used by engineers there assume usernames are immutable, making a username switch a multi-day process that is never really complete.</p>
<p>There is one easy “solution” to all of this, of course, which is to make it impossible to change your username. This is <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en">what gmail does</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your account’s email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can’t change it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the “usually”. I guess in certain, mysterious cases it’s possible to change it? In any case, making a random, numeric user ID immutable is fine. But if that user ID contains letters and is user-selected, making it immutable is an unacceptable solution for real-world situations. Whether it contains a user’s deadname, or an old nickname they don’t go by any longer, or even for those of us who, in sixth grade, decided “lordjubjub” would be an excellent and professional email address (just a hypothetical example, of course), usernames need to be editable. If they’re editable, why not avoid all these username troubles and just go for a fully-Unicode, non-unique display name instead?</p>
<h2>Username Alternatives</h2>
<p>250 million people have registered for Discord, a chat app similar to Slack or IRC. However, unlike Slack and IRC whose usernames are local to a particular server, Discord has just one server, and usernames are universal. With 250 million users in a single username …</p></div></div>

July 7, 2020 | https://secret.club/2020/07/06/bottleye.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://secret.club/2020/07/06/bottleye.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The popular anti-cheat <a href="https://battleye.com/">BattlEye</a> is widely used by modern online games such as <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape from Tarkov</a> and is considered an industry standard anti-cheat by many. In this article I will demonstrate a method I have been utilizing for the past year, which enables you to play any BattlEye-protected game online without even having to install BattlEye.</p><p>BattlEye is dynamically loaded by the respective game on startup to initialize the software service (“BEService”) and kernel driver (“BEDaisy”). These two components are critical in ensuring the integrity of the game, but the most critical component by far is the usermode library (“BEClient”) that the game interacts with directly. This module exports two functions: <code>GetVer</code> and more importantly <code>Init</code>.</p><p>The <em>Init</em> routine is what the game will call, but this functionality has never been documented before, as people mostly focus on BEDaisy or their <a href="https://secret.club/tags#battleye">shellcode</a>. Most important routines in <em>BEClient</em>, including <em>Init</em>, are protected and virtualised by <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/">VMProtect</a>, which we are able to devirtualise and reverse engineer thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vtil-project">vtil</a> by secret club member <a href="https://secret.club/author/can1357">Can Boluk</a>, but the inner workings of <em>BEClient</em> is a topic for a later part of this series, so here is a quick summary.</p><p><em>Init</em> and its arguments have the following definitions:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,

    remove_peer_t remove_peer;
};
</code></pre><p>As seen, these are quite simple containers for interopability between the game and <em>BEClient</em>. <code>becl_game_data</code> is defined by the game and contains functions that <em>BEClient</em> needs to call (for example, send_packet) while <code>becl_be_data</code> is defined by <em>BEClient</em> and contains callbacks used by the game after initialisation (for example, received_packet). Note that these two structures slightly differ in some games that have special functionality, such as the recently introduced packet encryption in <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> that we’ve already <a href="https://secret.club/2020/06/19/battleye-packet-encryption.html">cracked</a>. Older versions of BattlEye (DayZ, Arma, etc.) use a completely different approach with function pointer swap hooks to intercept traffic communication, and therefore these structures don’t apply.</p><p>A simple <em>Init</em> implementation would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_game_data<span>*</span> game_data,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_be_data<span>*</span> client_data)
{
    <span>// CACHE RELEVANT FUNCTIONS</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet    <span>=</span> game_data<span>-&gt;</span>send_packet;

    <span>// SETUP CLIENT STRUCTURE</span>
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>exit                   <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>exit;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>run                    <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>run;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>command                <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>command;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>received_packet        <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>received_packet;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>on_receive_auth_ticket <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>on_receive_auth_ticket;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>add_peer               <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>add_peer;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>remove_peer            <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>remove_peer;

    <span>return</span> battleye<span>::</span>instance_status<span>::</span>SUCCESSFULLY_INITIALIZED;
}
</code></pre><p>This would allow our custom BattlEye client to receive packets sent from the game server’s <em>BEServer</em> module.</p><p>The function <code>received_packet</code> is by far the most important routine used by the game, as it handles incoming packets from the BattlEye server component. BattlEye communication is extremely simple compared to how important the integrity of it is. In recent versions of BattlEye, packets follow the same general structure:</p><pre><code><span>#pragma pack(push, 1)
</span><span>struct</span> <span>be_fragment</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> count;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> index;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet_header</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> id;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> sequence;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet</span> <span>:</span> be_packet_header
{
    <span>union</span> 
    {
        be_fragment fragment;

        <span>// DATA STARTS AT body[1] IF PACKET IS FRAGMENTED</span>
        <span>struct</span>
        {
            <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> no_fragmentation_flag;
            std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> body[<span>0</span>];
        };
    };
    <span>inline</span> <span>bool</span> fragmented()
    {
        <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>!=</span> <span>0x00</span>;
    }
};
<span>#pragma pack(pop)
</span></code></pre><p>All packets have an identifier and a sequence number (which is used by the requests/response communication and the heartbeat). Requests and responses have a fragmentation mode which allows <em>BEServer</em> and <em>BEClient</em> to send packets in chunks of <code>0x400</code> bytes (seemingly arbitrary) instead of sending one big packet.</p><p>In the current iteration of BattlEye, the following packets are used for communication:</p><h3 id="init-00"> <a href="#init-00">INIT (<code>00</code>)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent to the <em>BEClient</em> module as soon as the connection with the game server has been established. This packet is only transmitted once, contains no data besides the packet id <code>00</code> and the response to this packet is simply <code>00 05</code>.</p><h3 id="start-02"> <a href="#start-02">START (‘02’)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent right after the ‘INIT’ packets have been exchanged, and contains the server-generated guid of the client. The response of this packet is simply the header: <code>02 00</code></p><h3 id="request-04--response-05"> <a href="#request-04--response-05">REQUEST (<code>04</code>) / RESPONSE (<code>05</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is sent from <em>BEServer</em> to <em>BEClient</em> to request (and in rare cases, simply transmit) data, and <em>BEClient</em> will send back data for that request using the <code>RESPONSE</code> packet type.</p><p>The first request contains crucial information such as service- and integration version, not responding to it will get you disconnected by the game server. Afterwards, requests are game specific.</p><h3 id="heartbeat-09"> <a href="#heartbeat-09">HEARTBEAT (<code>09</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is used by the <em>BEServer</em> module to ensure that the connection hasn’t been dropped. It is sent every 30 seconds using a sequential index, and if the client doesn’t respond with the same packet, the client is disconnected from the game server. This heartbeat packet is only three bytes long, with the sequential index used for synchronization being incremental and therefore easily emulated. An example heartbeat could be: <code>09 01 00</code>, which is the second heartbeat (sequence starts at zero) transmitted.</p><p>With this knowledge, it is possible by emulating the entire BattlEye anti-cheat with only two proprietary points of data: the responses for request sequence one and two. These can be intercepted using a tool such as wireshark and replayed as many times as you want for the respective game, because the packet encryption used by BattlEye is static and contextless.</p><p>Emulating the <code>INIT</code> packet is as stated simply responding with the sequence number five:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT<span>:</span>
{
    <span>auto</span> info_packet <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>be_packet{};
    info_packet.id       <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT;
    info_packet.sequence <span>=</span> <span>0x05</span>;

    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(<span>&amp;</span>info_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(info_packet));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>START</code> packet is done by replying with the received packet’s header:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>START<span>:</span>
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>HEARTBEAT</code> packets is done by replying with the received packet:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>HEARTBEAT<span>:</span>    
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, length);
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>REQUEST</code> packets can be done by replaying previously generated responses, which can be logged with code hooks or man-in-the-middle software. These packets are game specific and some games might disconnect you for not handling a specific request, but most games only require the first two requests to be handled, afterwards simply replying with the packet header is enough to not get disconnected by the game server. It is important to notice that all <code>REQUEST</code> packets are immediately responded to with the header, to let the server know that the client is aware of the request. This is how BottlEye emulates them:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>REQUEST<span>:</span>
{
    <span>// IF NOT FRAGMENTED RESPOND IMMEDIATELY, ELSE ONLY RESPOND TO THE LAST FRAGMENT</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> respond <span>=</span> 
        <span>!</span>header<span>-&gt;</span>fragmented() <span>||</span> 
        (header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.index <span>==</span> header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>-</span> <span>1</span>);

    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>respond)
        <span>return</span>;

    <span>// SEND BACK HEADER</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));

    <span>switch</span> (header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence)
    {
    <span>case</span> <span>0x01</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence,
            {
                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>
            });
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>case</span> <span>0x02</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence,

                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>
            });
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>default:</span>
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>break</span>;

</code></pre><p>Which uses the following helper function for responses:</p><pre><code><span>void</span> battleye<span>::</span>d…</code></pre></div></div>

I am sure you have often heard people respond to something that they say they want to do with “I don’t have time”. “I know I should work out but I don’t have time … I wish I spent more time with my kids but I don’t have time … I love to read but I just don’t have time anymore.” These people are either lying to you, or more likely, they are lying to themselves. </p>



<p>Most of us feel we do not have time for things but in reality we do not have the relative desire for them. We may want them, but we do not want them as much as the other things we are doing with our time. If we did, we would do them instead. Importantly, I am not referring to a spoken want but an actual one. I can say I want six pack abs but if I am not willing to put in the physical work to get there I don’t really want that more than the other things I spend my time doing during my days.</p>



<p>Most of the time, most people don’t truly want hardly anything as much as they want to check Instagram or Twitter or email. Of course, these are not the things they want directly but a means towards getting them. A dopamine hit from an Instagram like, a bite size piece of information or entertainment from a Tweet, or a sense of purpose through a feeling that one is needed, good at their job, and therefore good at something because they are known to respond to their emails in less than 10 minutes no matter the hour or the day. I know these things from experience.</p>



<p>The fact is that when one truly wants something and wants it more than everything else competing for the time in their day, one will absolutely make the time for that thing. Time does not come out of thin air. It comes from the other things we occupy ourselves doing. Everything is a trade-off. We operate based on a descending list of the things we care about whether we know them are not. </p>



<p>To understand what a real want feels like, it is helpful to think about and experience the fundamentals. Years ago, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcJHC9J7l4">an awesome motivational speech by a guy named Eric Thomas</a> where he tells his students they will be successful when they want it as badly as a person who is drowning wants to breathe (if you want to watch the first 3 minutes you will get the gist). Occasionally, I run several miles without a water bottle and I am reminded in the last couple of miles what it feels like to be truly thirsty, to want nothing but water. When you are sick, you usually want nothing but to feel better. When you are starving, all you want to do is eat. You will make time for what you want most. We can only do so much at a time and more distractions than ever are competing for our attention. This is why so many people feel there is not enough time in the day. </p>



<p>Next time you think about something you want to do or know you should do but “don’t have time” for, think again. You have the time, you just don’t care enough. In many cases, you will be content with that realization. In others, you will want to change it. Fortunately, you can. It is not about time. It is about you.</p>

		<h3>How to become a Bayesian in eight easy steps: An annotated reading list</h3>
<p><em>(TLDR: We wrote an annotated reading list to get you started in learning Bayesian statistics. <span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-017-1317-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Published version</a></span>. <span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301981861_How_to_become_a_Bayesian_in_eight_easy_steps_An_annotated_reading_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Researchgate</a>. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PsyArxiv</a></span>.)</em></p>
<p>It can be hard to know where to start when you want to learn about&nbsp;Bayesian statistics.&nbsp;I am frequently asked&nbsp;to share&nbsp;my favorite&nbsp;introductory resources to Bayesian statistics, and my go-to answer has been to share a dropbox folder with a bunch of PDFs that aren’t really sorted or cohesive. In some sense&nbsp;I was acting as&nbsp;little&nbsp;more than a glorified Google Scholar search bar.</p>
<p>It seems like there is&nbsp;some&nbsp;tension out there with regard to Bayes, in that many people want to know more about it, but when they pick up, say, Andrew Gelman and colleagues’&nbsp;<em>Bayesian Data Analysis</em> they get totally overwhelmed. And then they just think, “Screw this esoteric B.S.” and give up because it doesn’t seem like it is worth their time or effort.</p>
<p>I think this&nbsp;happens a lot. Introductory Bayesian texts usually assume a level of training in mathematical statistics that most researchers simply don’t have time (or otherwise don’t need) to learn. There are actually&nbsp;a lot of accessible Bayesian resources&nbsp;out there that don’t require much math stat background at all, but it just so happens&nbsp;that they are not consolidated anywhere so people don’t necessarily know about them.</p>
<h3>Enter the eight step program</h3>
<p>Beth Baribault, Peter Edelsbrunner (<span><a href="https://twitter.com/peter1328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@peter1328</a></span>), Fabian Dablander (<span><a href="https://twitter.com/fdabl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@fdabl</a></span>), Quentin Gronau, and I have just finished <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a&nbsp;new paper</a></span> that tries to&nbsp;remedy this situation, titled, “How to become a Bayesian in eight easy steps: An annotated reading list.” We were invited to submit this paper for a special issue on Bayesian statistics for&nbsp;<em>Psychonomic Bulletin and Review</em>.&nbsp;Each paper in the special issue addresses a specific question we often hear about Bayesian statistics, and ours was the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a reviewer/editor handling a manuscript that uses Bayesian methods; which articles should I read to get a quick idea of what that means?</p></blockquote>
<p>So <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>‘s goal is not so much to teach readers how to actually&nbsp;<em>perform</em> Bayesian data analysis — there are other papers in the special issue for that — but to facilitate readers in their quest to understand basic Bayesian concepts. We think it will&nbsp;serve as a nice introductory reading list for any interested researcher.</p>
<p>The format of <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span> is straightforward. We highlight&nbsp;eight papers that had a big impact on our own understanding of Bayesian statistics, as well as short descriptions of an additional 28 resources in the&nbsp;<em>Further reading </em>appendix. The first four papers&nbsp;are focused on theoretical introductions, and the second four&nbsp;have a&nbsp;slightly more applied focus.</p>
<p>We also give every resource&nbsp;a ranking from 1–9 on two dimensions: Focus (theoretical vs. applied) and Difficulty (easy vs. hard). We tried to provide a wide range of resources, from easy&nbsp;applications (#14: Wagenmakers, Lee, and Morey’s “Bayesian benefits for the pragmatic researcher”) to challenging&nbsp;theoretical discussions (#12: Edwards, Lindman and Savage’s “Bayesian statistical inference for psychological research”) and others&nbsp;in between.</p>
<p>The figure below (Figure A1, available on the last page of <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>) summarizes our rankings:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2338" data-permalink="https://alexanderetz.com/2016/02/07/understanding-bayes-how-to-become-a-bayesian-in-eight-easy-steps/readinglist/#main" data-orig-file="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png" data-orig-size="1100,1000" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Readinglist" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=700" src="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=700" alt="Readinglist.png" srcset="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=700 700w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=150 150w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=300 300w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=768 768w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=1024 1024w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>The emboldened numbers (1–8) are the papers that we’ve commented on&nbsp;in detail, numbers in light text (9–30) are papers we briefly describe in the appendix, and the italicized numbers (31–36) are our recommended introductory books (also listed in the appendix).</p>
<p>This is how we chose to frame&nbsp;<span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, the guide is designed such that a researcher might be able to read all eight of the highlighted articles and some supplemental readings within a few days. After readers acquaint themselves with these sources, they should be well-equipped both to interpret existing research and to evaluate new research that relies on Bayesian methods.</p></blockquote>
<h3>The list</h3>
<p>Here’s the list of papers we chose to cover&nbsp;in detail:</p>

</ol>
<p>You’ll have to check out&nbsp;<span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span> to see our commentary&nbsp;and to find out what other articles we&nbsp;included in the&nbsp;<em>Further reading</em> appendix. We provide urls (web archived when possible;&nbsp;<span><a href="http://archive.org/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archive.org/web/</a></span>) to PDFs of the eight main papers (except #2, that’s on the DBDA website), and wherever possible for the rest of the resources (some did not have free copies online;&nbsp;see&nbsp;the <em>References</em>).</p>
<p>I thought this was a fun&nbsp;paper&nbsp;to write, and if you think you might want to learn some Bayesian basics I hope you will consider reading it.</p>
<p>Oh, and I should mention that we wrote the whole paper collaboratively on <span><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/signup?ref=19f671ddd62a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overleaf.com</a></span>. It is a great site that makes it easy to&nbsp;get started using&nbsp;LaTeX, and I highly recommend trying it out.</p>
<p>This is the fifth post in the&nbsp;<span><em><a href="https://alexanderetz.com/understanding-bayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understanding Bayes</a></em></span> series. Until next time,</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago we wrote about "<a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">Our Experience with Stripe Atlas</a>" and what it was like to use them to start a small internet business (tldr; generally good).</p>
<p>One of the perks of Stripe Atlas is that they offer a heap of credits for multiple cloud platforms. From the Stripe site:</p>
<p>"Stripe Atlas founders can access free credits, exclusive access to free products, and discounted pricing from our partners, including $5,000 in credits from Amazon Web Services and $10,000 in credits from DigitalOcean."</p>
<p>There's always an understanding with services like this that credit offers come with a lot of hand-waving and "caveat emptor"-ing: notice founders "<em>have access to</em>" free credits (emphasis ours), which could imply that some founders have the capacity to call on those funds, but not all. But still, the language does seem very direct and makes it easy to believe signing up includes $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We have not received $5,000 in AWS credits. But now the good news: We <em>have</em> still received <strong>$1,000 in AWS credits</strong>.</p>
<p>$1,000 is still very generous, and a great gift from Stripe. No business filing with Stripe Atlas should ever depend on $1,000 of AWS credits as some kind of life-or-death runway, and for everyone receiving it it's more a small bonus than some kind of critical seed money.</p>
<p>But I do think it's useful to note, if you're an entrepreneur considering Stripe Atlas, what general figures you can expect. We're not a high capital-intensive operation of course, so if you're in a similar micro-saas space, then you also probably won't get the full 5k.</p>
<p>We're not sure what path you should take <em>to get</em> that possible $5,000 in AWS credits. There's not much communication about what criteria Stripe uses to arrive at the number they finalize on.</p>
<p>But you heard it from us: Take that 5,000 number with a grain of salt. It's a great gift - just maybe not as great as you think.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>In this blog post, I would like to show you a practical example of a “fake it till you make it” approach to product development. To my mind, it basically means that you are trying to stay a few steps ahead of your current situation. You are “faking” the idea that you have progressed more, but you actually haven’t. This approach gave me invaluable answers for my product which were hard to get otherwise.</p><h2 id="here-is-my-story">Here is my story:</h2><p>3 years ago, my former manager came to me and told me to do around 1500 banner ads. The company I worked for got new products and they wanted to market them in different countries. We got 6 products in 5 colors and the aim was to create ad banners for 3 countries. The goal was to create 15 formats of each banner ad. It was a nightmare for the graphic department. And I was its team leader.</p><p>When I imagined myself doing 1500 banner ads, I wanted to cry. This scenario of creating thousands of banners could happen easily every month. It is possible to do manually 1500 ad banners, but it is just… too boring! I wanted to be a creator, not a generator.</p><p>I started immediately googling how I can automate the process of creating banners sets. I found some solutions but they were pretty useless. They weren’t flexible enough.</p><p>I decided to create my own solution. I experimented with Photoshop, more specifically with the “Actions” feature there. Basically, the Actions feature was recording my steps in Photoshop. So, I could record how I manually generated banners, then play it again and&nbsp;generate the banners. It was pretty simple: Yet powerful. With this script I created, I was able to automate some parts of the process and help our department to be faster.</p><p>I was interested in a community of graphic designers who had the same problem. With my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/iChangeTheWay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ivan</a>, I created a landing page in a few hours. <a href="https://twitter.com/tmvst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tomas</a> sketched the logo in 5 minutes, then we came up with pricing. I created a video of the script and…</p><p>I posted it to a local Facebook designers’ community group.</p><p>And this is what happened:</p><p><span>

<em>My post to a local Facebook designers’ community group.</em></p><p>I was amazed by how many people had the same problem as us. What was more amazing was that 5 people bought the script. It wasn’t cheap, it cost around 110€. Looking back retrospectively, I think it was… a miracle. It showed me that the problem was there and people were willing to pay for the solution.</p><p>At that time I didn’t know anything about building a product, selling, consumer behavior, or SaaS (Software as a Service). Well, I knew the theory, but just from videos, friends, or lectures. But I didn’t have any tangible experience.</p><h2 id="i-started-with-experimentation">I started with experimentation.</h2><p>I created <strong>a free version of a Photoshop ad generator as a Freemium model,</strong> which could automate only 6 banner formats in contrast to the full version which could automate 20 formats. I gave it for free to people in exchange for getting feedback from them.</p><p>To be honest…</p><p>0 people bought the full version after they tried the free version.</p><p>Frankly put, it failed. I was overly optimistic&nbsp;and thought that the product would do better. On the other hand, It motivated me to ask people what was not working for them and how I could get better. I even gave the full professional freelancers version, which cost 110€, for free in exchange for feedback.</p><p>And what happened?</p><p><strong>Nobody wrote me back.</strong></p><p>It sucked. I didn’t know what to do next.</p><p>At that time I let it go. I didn’t have money to build the product and I didn’t feel that I had enough experience to build the software from scratch.</p><h2 id="after-more-than-a-year-break">After more than a year break</h2><p>After a year and a half, I decided to explore this topic again. I learned new things from Product Management, User Experience design, I was closer to friends who were dealing with product development on a daily basis. So I gave it a try.</p><p>The last script didn’t work for all graphics of banners, it worked only for a few specific graphics. It was good, but once you wanted to generate some complicated banner, this script did not work smoothly. Meanwhile, Photoshop developed a few other features, which changed the game. My game.</p><h2 id="little-technical-context">Little technical context</h2><p>Scripts are technically the easiest to do however, they are quite limited. I decided to learn more about what was feasible in Photoshop. I’d learned about plugins, which seemed like the right way to do things. However, to do a plugin, I needed a front end developer, because I couldn’t code on a sufficient level.</p><p>The problem is that building something with a developer is the most expensive thing to do. And I didn’t even know if people were still interested in the solution. The only thing I knew was that I wanted to improve generating ad banners as much as I could, but how it should work? I had no clue.</p><h2 id="just-do-it">Just do it!</h2><p>But I had something that I believed was powerful. Designer superpower. Really, Sam? Superpower?… Yes, superpower. Let me explain.</p><p>If I want to get rid of generating, what should I do? I could&nbsp; just hit some magic button and everything would be set. But how would it work? It’s time for 🥁 designer superpower, (which I believe is a designers’ toolset).</p><p><span>

<em>Designer superpower - designers<!-- -->’<!-- --> toolset</em></p><p>I realized that I could “fake” the whole plugin and interactions in it.

<em>Preparation for video.</em></p><p>Then I needed somehow to fake the algorithm of generating banners. So I recorded screen videos and I got rid of some parts. I removed these parts where I needed to manually re-organize components in banners. In the end, these screen recordings looked like a great generating algorithm.</p><p>Now the final part. I needed to connect these parts. For this purpose I used Adobe After Effects.</p><p>And this is the final video which took me 2 weeks to do:</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/JWApMjQ3-jE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/JWApMjQ3-jE</a></p><p>I showed this video to friends of mine and they thought that I had learned how to code. At that point, I knew I had done it well.</p><p><strong>🗒Side note:</strong> When you think of that, this is a superpower. With some tools, you can show people (in my case graphic designers) the future them and spark imagination. You can take some ideas and make them look real. Suddenly, all the people can see how your product should behave and what it should do. Isn’t that powerful?</p><p><span>

      </picture>
    </span>
<em>Facebook post with video which gave me 400 signups</em></p><p>I added my <a href="https://www.bannerium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">landing page</a> in the post, then I shared it to other groups/forums and I got 400 signups.</p><p>I even got some deal with a design agency, which told me that they would give us some money to develop a plugin. Moreover, I even had 2 meetings with them. Just based on the video.</p><p>In the end, nothing came from this deal. That was reasonable. Here is why: The truth was, that I had just released the video. I didn’t have anything else. Just some parts connected with duct tape. At that time, I had no clue how close we could get with the real code.</p><p><strong>💡Lesson learned</strong></p><p>Showing a “fake” video is powerful for sharing a vision and testing if there is a need for a solution. On the other hand, if the video is too ambitious, people will take it as a norm and will base their expectations on the video. If the real product doesn’t match the video afterward, they will probably be unsatisfied because the product is&nbsp;incomplete. This thing happened to me when I had a call with a user during beta testing. She expected that the complete product should work as it was on the video. So sometimes it is better to be realistic. Otherwise, you will create unhappy initial users. But I believe it is a trade-off and you need to count on that.</p><p>Once I saw that the product was still in demand I found a programmer called Petr and we started with the development of the plugin. The video was also a great tool for how to communicate what I wanted to achieve. Of course, video showed happy path&nbsp;and I needed to design “what if” scenarios, afterwards. But it served my expectations&nbsp;perfectly.</p><p>Then we went through beta testing, which 50 people joined. Nowadays the <a href="https://bannerium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">product is live.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2><h3 id="a-designer-toolset-is-a-superpower-you-can-easily-create-something-that-was-not-on-the-market-before-and-validate-your-idea-just-in-a-week">A Designer toolset is a superpower.

<article>
    <p>Have you ever thought how good it would be to have a help message for your shell script
that you wrote a month ago and already forgot what it is supposed to do?</p>
<p>Yeah, there is always a way to show a message using cat (meow) or a bunch of echo
calls.</p>
<p>But there is a neat trick.</p>
<p>Add your message with all the required information on top of your file, just right
after the shebang.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span><span>###</span>
<span>### my-script — does one thing well</span>
<span>###</span>
<span>### Usage:</span>
<span>###   my-script &lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;</span>
<span>###</span>
<span>### Options:</span>
<span>###   &lt;input&gt;   Input file to read.</span>
<span>###   &lt;output&gt;  Output file to write. Use '-' for stdout.</span>
<span>###   -h        Show this message.</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Halfway done, now need to get this message in runtime with sed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">help<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    sed -rn <span>'s/^### ?//;T;p'</span> <span>"</span><span>$0</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>$0</code> means a filename of a file that is being executed.</p>
<p>A bit about the magic that is going here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>s</code> — stands for substitute the following pattern;</li>
<li><code>/</code> — keyword to define start/end of the pattern;</li>
<li><code>^### ?</code> — match a string starting with ### and an optional space after;</li>
<li><code>//</code> — there could be something between the slashes, but since nothing is here, replace
the pattern with an empty string;</li>
<li><code>T</code> — Jumps to the end of sed-script if no s/// has done a successful substitution;</li>
<li><code>p</code> — Prints the result of the substitution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now just call the <code>help</code> function if an arg <code>-h</code> or no args passed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$#</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>]]</span> <span>||</span> <span>[[</span> <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"-h"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>help</span>
    <span>exit</span> <span>1</span>
<span>fi</span>

<h2>Prelude</h2>



<p><em>I have been writing about </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2010/04/05/black-founders/"><em>Diversity in Tech for over a decade now</em></a><em> – a long time. However, my self-published posts have never really got the audience it was targeted at, which is, the Silicon Valley Main Street. This time around, I wanted to do something different with regard to distribution.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Since I completed this post over two weeks ago, I’ve hawked it as an Op-Ed to </em><strong><em>ALL</em></strong><em> main street US (Tech) media – 22 of them. Sadly, but unsurprisingly and understandably, I’ve had no takers. It is a big request to ask anyone, including journalists, to give a dissenting voice an audience, so I have decided to self-publish again, but this time around, I hope the primary intended audience gets to see it and the conversation happens. <strong>Abeg (please), share it</strong> as you wish me luck holding these very powerful people to account.</em></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>No thanks to the brutal execution of George Floyd and more importantly, thanks to the persistence of protesters, the conversation about institutional racism in various parts of American life is back to the fore and has been sustained. The tech industry has not been exempted.</p>



<p>As with previous cycles, it has cast blame towards the typical suspects: Big Tech and Venture Capital. And as with previous conversation cycles, one key player in the diversity deficient tech world is wriggling away unscathed, yet again. Silicon Valley Big Tech Media.</p>



<h2>Pattern Matching in Tech</h2>



<p><em>Pattern matching</em> is a colloquial terminology in the tech industry that refers to the propensity for established players in tech e.g. Venture Capitalists, taking superficial patterns of successful founders (young white boys who have dropped out of Stanford or Harvard) and using them to determine future investment decisions.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I can be tricked by anyone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg”</p><cite><em>Paul Graham (According to The New York Times)</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Though <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/tricked.html">eventually clarified by Paul Graham</a>, that attributed quote articulately captures the spirit of Pattern Matching. Since how one “looks” is one of the obvious patterns one can observe in a human, it is believed that pattern matching disproportionally affects “people of colour” (why do we use this term?).</p>



<p>I have no problem with pattern matching. In psychology it is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>, which is natural and critical for survival. It is how human beings recognise things and make vital decisions quickly, with little data.</p>



<p>My first memory of Pattern Matching was while playing football (the real one) as a kid. The guys with the bow-legged swagger, wearing boots and a shin guard were always picked first. It was almost automatic because they looked like talented footballers. And that’s how I learned to pick my teams. After missing out on some straight legged barefoot talents and picking several kitted-out clowns, I adjusted and used more sensible parameters.</p>



<p>I learned something from that though: Pattern matching is all well and good until it receives contradicting data. It’s all about the data.</p>



<h2>The Role of Big Tech Media in Pattern Matching</h2>



<p>In the past decade, Big Tech Media has rightfully shone the light on racial inequality in the ranks of Big Corporations and Venture Capital in the tech industry. The Diversity Reports — as they are known, of Big Tech and VC have been published routinely.</p>



<p>The media are very powerful. It is through them we learn and understand the world beyond ourselves. Their importance and power in shaping opinions cannot be overstated as they are very key in providing the data which influences patterns that lead to decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Tech, when it comes to personnel, a lot of that data comes in the form of presence. The Big Tech Media controls it all via narrative and coverage in their publications and mega conferences. It is through the media that every player – VCs, Tech Executives, Founders etc learn about the tech world that exists outside of their immediate spheres.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to the diversity in tech debate, I wonder: how have Big Tech Media, the primary opinion shapers of the tech industry, escaped any scrutiny? Then it hit me: when you are busy pointing your torch at others, you forget to point it at yourself.</p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media remains a critical piece if we are to rejig the data to alter diversity-deficient patterns in tech, it’s high-time we shone the light on Big Tech Media.</p>



<p><em>[RANDOM: Watching the film </em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/"><em>Hidden Figures</em></a><em> made me almost cry. I had </em><strong><em>absolutely no idea</em></strong><em> that in the 60s, there were Black women mathematicians and programmers who were good enough to work for the NASA Space Program. Imagine if this was always common knowledge. I can only imagine how many more black folks it would have influenced to take up a career in Computer Science and Technology].</em></p>



<h2>Diversity Report of (Silicon Valley) Big Tech Media</h2>



<p>In 2015, I looked at <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2015/10/15/where-are-the-black-tech-foundersexecutive-speakers-at-major-tech-conferences/">the racial makeup of the largest tech conferences in the world</a>. The results were damning. I wondered how these organisers could be so oblivious. It then occurred to me to check out the people making these decisions, and it was clear why they were colour blind; they didn’t have the right ‘lenses’ i.e., makeup of the editorial/media team, to notice the absence of certain colours.</p>



<p>In this report card, I will look at the racial diversity makeup of both speaker line-ups and the editorial teams of Big Tech Media – who are mostly in Silicon Valley, and contrast their 2015 with today.</p>



<h2>The Candidates</h2>



<h3><strong>TechCrunch</strong></h3>



<p>TechCrunch, owned by AOL/Verizon has been the Big Dog of tech startup chronicling and commentary since 2005. More so, they host arguably the largest and most influential startup conference called Disrupt. I have followed TechCrunch since 2007 and experienced the startup evolution through them.</p>



<h3><strong>Recode</strong></h3>



<p>In the past decade, Recode has evolved from being All Things Digital at WSJ to being Independent to now being a unit at Vox Media. One constant throughout its evolution has been the very formidable Kara Swisher, who is arguably the single most influential person in Big Tech Media.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Information</strong></h3>



<p>This subscription-based tech publication is high up the list in shaping opinion among Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley. It was started by Jessica Lessin who is a formidable reporter and an Alumnus of WSJ. They have a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/vc-diversity-index">VC Diversity Index</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Business Insider</strong></h3>



<p>Based in New York and founded by the great Henry Blodget, Business Insider is a top 3 tech voice in the tech industry.</p>



<h3><strong>Protocol</strong></h3>



<p>Backed by a bunch of heavyweights, this publication launched this year with a lot of panache.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How well have they done?</p>



<h2>Racial Diversity Report Card of Major US/Silicon Valley Tech Media</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6Bmj3M1sgqCR3PijCsyoYF5OrovGUDFEEujYSItZb0/edit?usp=sharing">Here is the data for this table</a> in spreadsheet format and links to sources.</p>







<p>It is good to highlight problems but better to proffer solutions. But first, do these people recognise that there is a problem? Do they want to solve it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015 when I wrote my previous post, I had the impression some did. In my <a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian/status/738076047539896321">Twitter engagement with Kara Swisher</a> after my first post, Aunty Kara gave the patronising response by referencing “the adept use of social media” as a representation of Black in Tech, I offered to engage privately (I threw in my<a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian/status/802151006754795520"> beer diplomacy</a> for good measure). It came to nought.</p>



<p><em>[Shalaye (Explanation): Aunty Kara took me up on the offer. As agreed, I reached out on 3 subsequent trips to the US and Silicon Valley. After sending about half a dozen emails, initially replied with excuses, Kara went cold and stopped responding. She is not the first Silicon Valley person whose Twitter (public) position contrasts with their private ones, so I haven’t taken it personally. I’d be more than happy to grab that beer if she’s open to it]</em></p>



<p>If Big Tech companies especially the media wish to change things, they have to first stop being colour-blind and get competent people who have eyes for the blind spots. A deliberate, sincere effort will yield good fruit.</p>



<p><strong>If you are a privileged person in the tech industry who wants to be a true “ally” and see things improve, here are some actionable things to do:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ol><li>If you are on yet another panel and you notice the absence of accomplished Black tech players, speak up. Make recommendations. I am happy for you to ask me if your black network isn’t that vast. See Appendix (<strong>Note:</strong> Black folks have great competence about things outside the diversity topic).</li><li>If you are a VC and you are in on a good deal, try to work with the founder and carve out an allocation for those good black investors that aren’t as opportune to have your network. We all know the deal flow is the <em>koko (main thing).</em> If you want to help, share the deal.</li><li>If you are recruiting for a senior role in your executive team or board, you can take a book from the NFL beyond Colin Kaepernick’s brave kneeling protest; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule">Rooney Rule</a>. Just make sure you have a qualified black person in your interview shortlist. That’s not too much of an ask.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>I wrote in an email to my white founder friend recently: <em>I see many organisations “fighting” systemic racism by opening their cheque books. A donation here, a freebie there. It makes them feel good, perhaps. It’s like a retweet but with money.</em></p>



<p>So, decide if you want to show concern or effect change. I prefer both.</p>







<ol><li>Every company (including Big Tech Media) has the prerogative to invite or cover anyone they like. However, the proprietors of Tech Media cannot play watchmen and feign concern about the diversity in tech debate while their actions are in direct contrast.</li><li>In this post, I focused on these …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>Around 1.5 years ago, I did an <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis">analysis of YouTube trending videos</a> in US. That analysis was performed on trending videos of some months in 2017 and 2018. The analysis received a lot of interest on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis">Kaggle</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9kpmcn/i_analyzed_more_than_40000_youtube_trending/">Reddit</a>; I also received some emails praising the work done. That was 1.5 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Today</strong>, I present an improved and expanded version of that analysis. This analysis is more advanced and contains new interesting elements. In this analysis, <strong>All trending videos for the whole year of 2019</strong> were analyzed (More than <strong>70,000</strong> videos).</p>

<p>Titles, descriptions, thumbnails, tags, views, likes/dislikes, and comments were all analyzed to produce the results shown in this post. Continue reading to know more about the analysis and the data or you can <a href="#analysis-res">jump directly to the results section</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-youtube-trending-videos">What are YouTube Trending Videos?</h2>

<p>YouTube, as you know, is the most popular and most used video platform in the world today. YouTube has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending">a list of <strong>trending videos</strong></a>. I’ll quote the description of trending videos from <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739?hl=en">YouTube itself</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trending helps viewers see what’s happening on YouTube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos that a wide range of viewers would find interesting. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video. Trending isn’t personalized and displays the same list of trending videos in each country to all users.</p>

  <p>The list of trending videos is updated roughly every 15 minutes. With each update, videos may move up, down, or stay in the same position in the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="summary-of-some-key-results-of-the-analysis">Summary of Some Key Results of the Analysis</h2>

<p>The main goal of the analysis is to find interesting facts and patterns by exploring the data and by using effective visualizations.</p>

<p><strong>If you don’t have time</strong> to read the full analysis, here are some of the insights that were extracted from the data along with links to their sections in the analysis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Linus Tech Tips (a technology channel) was the channel that <a href="#trending-channels">produced most trending videos in 2019</a>. It is a technology (not entertainment nor music) and personal (not corporate) channel. More than that, the 2nd and 3rd channels after Linus Tech Tips were cooking channels.</li>
  <li>While a video might stay on the trending list for one day or less, there are 6 videos that appeared on the list <a href="#trending-for-30-days">for 30 days</a>.</li>
  <li>BTS’ song “Boy With Luv” was the most <a href="#trending-videos-and-views">viewed</a>, <a href="#trending-videos-and-likes-and-dislikes">liked</a>, and <a href="#trending-videos-and-comments">commented</a> video. However, it was also the 5th most <a href="#trending-videos-and-likes-and-dislikes">disliked</a> video.</li>
  <li>Some videos appeared on the trending list <a href="#how-many-views-videos-had-when-they-first-became-trending">when they had only around 50,000 views</a>.</li>
  <li>Words like “official”, “video”, “2019”, “vs”, “trailer”, “music”, “game”, “new”, “highlights”, “first”, and “challenge” were among the <a href="#what-are-the-most-common-words-in-video-titles">most common in trending video titles</a>. So if you include the current year in your title, does that increase trending chances?</li>
  <li>🔥 was the <a href="#what-are-the-most-common-words-in-video-titles">most common emoji</a> in trending video titles.</li>
  <li>While the minimum was 3 and the maximum was 100, most trending videos <a href="#titles-lengths">have titles lengths between 36 and 64 characters</a>.</li>
  <li>There was a video that became trending when it had <a href="#how-many-comments-videos-had-when-they-first-became-trending">only 7 comments</a>.</li>
  <li>YouTube Rewind videos of 2018 and 2019 were the 1st and 2nd <a href="#trending-videos-and-likes-and-dislikes">most disliked videos</a>.</li>
  <li>On average, <a href="#how-long-does-it-take-a-video-to-become-trending">videos take 1.5 days</a> to appear on the trending list for the first time.</li>
  <li>While the allowed maximum is 5,000 character, most trending videos have their <a href="#how-long-is-the-description">descriptions length between 500 and 1500 characters</a>.</li>
  <li>A lot of trending videos put <a href="#most-common-words-in-trending-videos-descriptions">social media links</a> in their descriptions.</li>
  <li>Almost all trending videos <a href="#trending-videos-tags">use tags</a>. On average, 21 tags.</li>
  <li>By running an object-detection algorithm on the thumbnails of trending videos, <a href="#whats-inside-trending-videos-thumbnails">it turned out that a person is the most common object</a> in the thumbnails. So you might consider adding a person photo in your next video.</li>
  <li>Do you want to see the <a href="#what-are-the-most-used-colors-in-trending-videos-thumbnails">most common colors</a> in video thumbnails that were extracted after a lot of processing?</li>
</ul>

<p>The analysis covers <strong>much more</strong> as you will see soon…</p>



<p>This analysis was performed using Python and a powerful group of Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, ImageAI, WordCloud, and more.</p>

<p>The analysis were performed in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<h3 id="code-used">Code Used</h3>

<p>You can find all the code used for this analysis in a Jupyter notebook <a href="https://github.com/ammar1y/YouTube-Trending-Videos-Analysis-2019">on this link</a>. Feel free to read the code and re-use it however you want. Also note that the notebook contains more analyses than the ones shown here in this post, so if you want to see everything, refer to the notebook after you finish reading this post.</p>

<h2 id="data-source">Data Source</h2>

<p>The data used in this analysis was retrieved using YouTube API. A script was scheduled to run <strong>each day throughout 2019 and fetch data from YouTube API about the trending videos of that day</strong>. The script would then process the data received from YouTube and store them in text files.</p>

<p>The scraping script is not my work. It can be found on Github: <a href="https://github.com/mitchelljy/Trending-YouTube-Scraper"> Trending-YouTube-Scraper</a>. I put the script on a AWS EC2 instance and scheduled it—using Crontab—to run every day at a specific time.</p>

<p>After 2019 ended, I connected to the AWS instance using FileZilla application and downloaded all the data produced by the script. There was a file for each day of 2019. To perform the analysis, I needed to process the data in order to merge the files into a single CSV file.</p>

<p>If you want to <strong>download the data used in this analysis</strong> which describes 2019's trending videos in the United States, you can buy it securely on Gumroad <u><strong><a href="https://gum.co/qEzKK" target="_blank">on this link</a></strong></u> or by using the button below. Along with United States, you'll also get trending-videos data for United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries as well.</p>

<h2 id="data-size-and-description">Data Size and Description</h2>

<p><strong>In this post, United-States trending videos will be analyzed</strong>, which constitute a total of <strong>72,994</strong> videos. YouTube usually place 200 videos in the trending list each day which would mean that we should have 73,000 (365 x 200) videos. We have 72,994. This is probably because on a few days, the number of Trending videos was slightly less than 200.</p>

<p>So we have data on 72,994 trending videos to analyze. On YouTube, <strong>the same video might appear on the trending list for many days. This means that the 72,994 videos are not unique videos</strong>. In fact, among the 72,994 videos, <strong>we have 11,177 unique videos</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, 11,177 videos showed on the trending list throughout 2019. Some of them might have stayed on the list for 10 days, some for 20 days, etc. We will see later in the analysis more info about this.</p>

<p>The following table shows an example of <strong>the data that we have for each video</strong>:</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p><br>
As we can see, we have the ID of the video which is a unique value for the video across YouTube (No two videos have the same ID). We also have the title of the video, its publishing date and time, the channel that published it, its category, and its description and tags. We also have the number of the views, likes, dislikes, and comments of the video. There are also a few more data shown in the table.</p>

<p>We can see that there is a field named “trending_date”. This field specifies the date on which this video was trending. As we said earlier, the same video might appear on the trending-videos list for more than one day. This means that we might find another record in the data for the same video ID but with different “trending_date” and maybe different number of views, comments, likes, etc. (because those numbers are likely to increase from one day to another).</p>



<h2 id="analysis-results">Analysis Results</h2>

<p>Now let’s start the best part of this post, let’s see the analysis results.</p>

<p><span id="note-uniq"></span><strong>Please note</strong> that for the following analyses, <strong>unless otherwise stated</strong>, we applied the analysis on all of the <strong>72,994</strong> trending videos, <strong>not</strong> on the unique trending videos only. The reasoning behind this is that we are interested in videos considered trending by YouTube. So if a video is considered trending for 3 days, then we believe that it has more trending power and more trending characteristics than a video that was trending for 1 day only; thus, it should have more weight. So <strong>we include the 3 occurrences of that video in the analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>For some analyses, considering only unique videos is more appropriate. When that is the case, you will see a note telling you about that.</p>

<h3 id="trending-videos-and-views">Trending Videos and Views</h3>

<p><strong>The Trending Video with the Highest Number of Views</strong> is a song by BTS band named “Boy With Luv”. The video was published on 12/April/2019 and on 23/04/2019, it appeared on the trending list with 195,376,667 views which is the highest number of views a trending video had in 2019.</p>

<p>In the table below, you can see <strong>the top 3 trending videos based on the number of views</strong>. These trending videos had views when they appeared on the trending list more than any other trending video. This table was produced by considering unique trending videos only (<a href="#note-uniq">For more</a>).</p>

  <stylepoint title="Note: Displaying Hidden Details in this Guide">
     <summary>
       This style guide contains many details
       that are initially hidden from view.
       They are marked by the triangle icon, which you see here on your left.
       Click it now. You should see "Hooray" appear below.
     </summary>
     
       <p>
        Hooray!  Now you know you can expand points to get more details.
        Alternatively, there's an "expand all" at the top of this document.

<category title="Background">
  <p>
    Common Lisp is a powerful multiparadigm programming language.
    With great power comes great responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    This guide recommends formatting and stylistic choices
    designed to make your code easier for other people to understand.
    For those internal applications and free software libraries that
    we develop at Google,
    you should keep within these guidelines when making changes.
    Note however that each project has its own rules and customs
    that complement or override these general guidelines;
    the speed-oriented QPX low fare search engine notably
    has a very different style and feel from the QRes reservation system.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're writing Common Lisp code outside Google,
    we invite you to consider these guidelines.
    You may find some of them useful
    where they don't conflict with other priorities you have.
    We welcome remarks and constructive feedback
    on how to improve our guide, and
    on what alternate styles work for you and why.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This guide is not a Common Lisp tutorial.
    For basic information about the language, please consult
    <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>.
    For a language reference, please consult the
    <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">Common Lisp HyperSpec</a>.
    For more detailed style guidance, take (with a pinch of salt)
    a look at Peter Norvig and Kent Pitman's
    <a href="http://norvig.com/luv-slides.ps">style guide</a>.

</overview>
<category title="Meta-Guide">
  <stylepoint title="Must, Should, May, or Not">
    <summary>
      Each guideline's level of importance is indicated
      by use of the following keywords and phrases, adapted from
      <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.
    </summary>
    
      <table>
        <tbody><tr>
          <th>MUST</th>
          <td>
            <p>
              This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL",
              means that the guideline is an absolute requirement.
              You must ask permission to violate a MUST.

        <tr>
          <th>MUST NOT</th>
          <td>
            <p>
              This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT",
              means that the guideline is an absolute prohibition.
              You must ask permission to violate a MUST NOT.

              This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", means that
              there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
              to ignore the demands of the guideline, but
              the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed
              before choosing a different course.
              You must ask forgiveness for violating a SHOULD.

              the full implications should be understood and carefully weighed

        Unlike RFCs, we don't capitalize every instance of one of the above
        keywords when it is used.
      </p>
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Permission and Forgiveness">
    <summary>
      There are cases where transgression of some of these rules
      is useful or even necessary.
      In some cases, you must seek permission or obtain forgiveness
      from the proper people.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Permission comes from the owners of your project.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Forgiveness is requested in a comment
        near the point of guideline violation,
        and is granted by your code reviewer.
        The original comment should be signed by you, and
        the reviewer should add a signed approval to the comment at review time.
      </p>
      
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Conventions">
    <summary>
      You MUST follow conventions. They are not optional.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Some of these guidelines are motivated by universal principles of good programming.
        Some guidelines are motivated by technical peculiarities of Common Lisp.
        Some guidelines were once motivated by a technical reason,
        but the guideline remained after the reason subsided.
        Some guidelines, such those about as comments and indentation,
        are based purely on convention, rather than on clear technical merit.
        Whatever the case may be, you must still follow these guidelines,
        as well as other conventional guidelines
        that have not been formalized in this document.
      </p>
      <p>
        You MUST follow conventions.
        They are important for readability.
        When conventions are followed by default,
        violations of the convention are a signal
        that something notable is happening and deserves attention.
        When conventions are systematically violated,
        violations of the convention are a distracting noise
        that needs to be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conventional guidelines <em>are</em> indoctrination.
        Their purpose is to make you follow the mores of the community,
        
        so you can more effectively cooperate with existing members.
        It is still useful to distinguish the parts that are technically motivated
        from the parts that are mere conventions,
        so you know when best to defy conventions for good effect,
        and when not to fall into the pitfalls that the conventions are there to help avoid.
      </p>
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Old Code">
    <summary>
      Fix old code as you go.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        A lot of our code was written before these guidelines existed.
        You should fix violations as you encounter them
        in the course of your normal coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not fix violations en masse
        without warning other developers and coordinating with them,
        so as not to make the merging of large branches
        more difficult than it already is.
      </p>
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Future Topics">
    <summary>
      There are many topics for additional standardization
      not covered by current version of this document,
      but deferred to future versions.

<category title="General Guidelines">
  <stylepoint title="Principles">
    <summary>
      There are some basic principles for team software development
      that every developer must keep in mind.
      Whenever the detailed guidelines are inadequate, confusing or contradictory,
      refer back to these principles for guidance:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every developer's code must be easy for another developer
          to read, understand, and modify
          â€” even if the first developer isn't around to explain it.
          (This is the "hit by a truck" principle.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Everybody's code should look the same.
          Ideally, there should be no way to look at lines of code
          and recognize it as "Fred's code" by its style.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be precise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be concise.
        </li>
        <li>
          KISS â€” Keep It Simple, Stupid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the smallest hammer for the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use common sense.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep related code together.
          Minimize the amount of jumping around
          someone has to do to understand an area of code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </summary>
    
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Priorities">
    <summary>
      <p>
        When making decisions about how to write a given piece of
        code, aim for the following -ilities in this priority order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Usability by the customer
        </li>
        <li>
          Debuggability/Testability
        </li>
        <li>
          Readability/Comprehensibility
        </li>
        <li>
          Extensibility/Modifiability
        </li>
        <li>
          Efficiency (of the Lisp code at runtime)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Most of these are obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usability by the customer means that the system has to do what the
        customer requires; it has to handle the customer's transaction
        volumes, uptime requirements; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Lisp efficiency point,
        given two options of equivalent complexity,
        pick the one that performs better.
        (This is often the same as the one that conses less,
        i.e. allocates less storage from the heap.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Given two options where one is more complex than the other,
        pick the simpler option and revisit the decision only if
        profiling shows it to be a performance bottleneck.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, avoid premature optimization.
        Don't add complexity to speed up something that runs rarely,
        since in the long run, it matters less whether such …</p></stylepoint></category></div></div>

<p>It was a frigid cold day in Des Moines on January 28, 2019.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Like most January days, I was just hoping to hold on a few more weeks until the early signs of Spring would start to thaw things out and give me that yearly boost of energy.</p>



<p>But, it turned out that I was going to get a different kind of jolt.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.hellosign.com/blog/a-letter-from-our-ceo-were-joining-dropbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dropbox Acquires HelloSign for $230mm (opens in a new tab)">Dropbox Acquires HelloSign for $230mm</a>,” the headline read in my push notifications.<br></p>



<p>I stared at it for a long time.</p>



<p>A combination of shock and elation took hold as I bounded out of bed.<br></p>



<p>HelloSign and Optimist had been working together for nearly two years at this point. But I had no idea that the acquisition was in play. The whole deal has been basically kept under wraps. Most of the team only found out about it right before it was finalized.<br></p>



<p>It was a momentous achievement for their team.<br></p>



<p>When we first started working with HelloSign, they had just raised their Series A and were on a path to rapidly expand their eSignature solution, roll out HelloWorks, and move upmarket with HelloSign integrations and API.<br></p>



<p>There was a lot to do and a lot of content and strategy to figure out.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>We had our work cut out for us.</em><br></p>



<p>Luckily, our team and the HelloSign team are both full of outrageously smart people. We dug in and put together a strategy.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IcibgJc6j5tpYXEm_m_ik9W_YNLIIrvzZmHTBHmriqbihYkO2NXDz9SogzmE-H203ML1Ju0uP7cRPqUx1tfIZVWA1m96_8xdxPLSvlIP7m05Ej7q9o3kuaEoE_oESJVNPETObhOq" alt="HelloSign's Organic Traffic Growth (October 2017 to January 2019)"></figure>



<p>Over the previous 17 months (and to this day), we worked closely with the HelloSign team to drive 1,308% growth in targeted organic traffic. This growth correlated almost perfectly with the growth of their business and the acquisition that took place in January.<br></p>



<p>Through this process and in working with many other SaaS companies over the years, we have developed and refined some key strategies and tactics that we use to drive growth for all of our clients and other SaaS businesses in particular.<br></p>



<p>From that, we’ve distilled those strategies into a core framework that defines how we achieve specific results and reach key goals.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This article is about that framework.</p>



<h2>Content Marketing for SaaS: Driving User Signups</h2>



<p>Nearly all SaaS companies have pretty straightforward goals for their content marketing:<br></p>



<ol><li>Drive product sign-ups and trials</li><li>Everything else. (Traffic, brand awareness,&nbsp;leads, emails, etc)</li></ol>



<p>HelloSign is no different.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Although they have a number of market focuses and products that were in play, the ultimate business objective of our work together was–unsurprisingly–to grow users.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, that’s what we set out to do.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The question, of course, is how you use content as a lever for both capturing the right audience, convincing them of the value of the product, and ultimately converting them into customers.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NE0svR6j4qHgtXc2V0wxw-XR_jXTW2e6L1PcoXncPqUFLJJf-5yorAWPbmSo7GTA0rQ1AVPBM5L13O3khI7G6SyuyCWMJdKTaxAHrwyqa1jQ8A24fTUK7JHuZ6iz4crHUrOTLlkI" alt=""></figure>



<p>In most instances, these goals feel at odds with one another. The content that is most valuable to you as a business (most product-focused) is often less valuable to a reader who is trying to learn about a topic or solve a problem broadly.<br></p>



<p>As with most content marketing frameworks, we find that the key is to unpack the specific moving parts and build a strategy that addresses each specific goal as part of a broader strategy.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In other words, break it down and solve for each piece independently. Then pull everything together into a cohesive framework.</p>



<h2>The SaaS Content Funnel Paradox</h2>



<p>Most SaaS product signups (trials, leads, etc) come from the middle of the funnel.<br></p>



<p>In other words, a prospect has researched their problem, discovered a general solution, and they begin researching products that offer it. In most cases, few prospects read content that’s at the top of the funnel and immediately hop into a product–it’s rare.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This means that in order for a SaaS content marketing strategy to be successful, you need to put a lot of emphasis on driving solution-aware traffic to content and pages that are in the middle of the funnel.<br></p>



<p><em>But there’s a challenge</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The pages on your site that are most relevant to a middle-of-the-funnel searcher are your core product pages–features, integrations, solutions, etc.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>These are notoriously difficult pages to rank (especially in a crowded market like esignatures) because there are very few ways for them to naturally accrue links or promote such product-focused content directly to a prospect.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1.png" alt="HelloSign's Product Marketing site is full of targeted landing pages" srcset="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1.png 1024w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1-980x521.png 980w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>This creates a paradox.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The pages that you care most about ranking and generating traffic to are also, often, the most difficult to rank and drive traffic to.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, how do you overcome this obstacle, resolve the paradox, and restore order to the universe? (Okay, maybe just that first part.)<br></p>



<p>The solution is to <a href="http://yesoptimist.com/frameworks">create a framework</a> that leverages <em>top of the funnel content</em> as a means to generate not just traffic, but also links (domain and topical authority) that helps these important pages rank over time.<br></p>



<p>This has become the basis for our work with most SaaS clients.</p>



<h2>The Optimist SaaS Content Marketing Framework</h2>



<p>Before we get into the specifics of how we executed this strategy, I want to reveal the framework that we use to shape our thinking and our approach.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This framework builds on our trifecta strategy that we originally developed from my work scaling College Raptor from <a href="https://www.yesoptimist.com/content-marketing-seo-case-study-the-trifecta-strategy/">0 to 100,000 organic searches/mo</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>But, given the specific nuances of the SaaS business model and the extended B2B buyer’s journey, it’s not a simple cut-and-paste process.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JdENWX5eN_LOMVx2I778zGXks82Eu5MkC92ktCgboJrcur7JAo8f4fL_h--FFGUsYwsffYMq9_RderLzTycXIEcGwE4gZKm9WyTrHe2w27jUojSYaRNlB8-e_WwMoQj5rkKBiHG0" alt=""></figure>



<p>The framework that we developed integrates key insights about how buyers interact with SaaS businesses and which strategies are most effective for driving actual conversions.<br></p>



<p>For our work with HelloSign, we applied a framework similar to this. Ultimately, we’ve found that most SaaS businesses have similar goals and thus, the overall approach to content marketing is a variation of this general framework.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s not one-size-fits-all, but it’s about as close as you can get when you’re talking about true strategy.<br></p>



<p>Let’s step through all of the types of content that were part of HelloSign’s massive growth.</p>



<h2>Pre-Funnel Content: Targeting the Right Buyers</h2>



<p>Before we dive into the actual funnel and the buyer’s journey, I want to begin with what we call pre-funnel or persona-qualified content.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Although it’s often at least one step removed from a buying cycle, pre-funnel content can serve an important supporting role in a SaaS content marketing strategy. The idea here is to create content that attracts your target buyer <em>broadly</em>, even if they aren’t problem-aware.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-1024x544.png" alt="Thought leadership content attracts relevant buyers, even if they are pre-funnel." srcset="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-1024x544.png 1024w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-980x521.png 980w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>Case in point: HelloSign speaks a lot to sales leaders in their content. We created a lot of content that was aimed at generally helping this persona do their job better, even if that didn’t involve using HelloSign’s products to do it.<br></p>



<p>This allows us to accomplish a number of things:&nbsp;<br></p>



<ol><li>Expand search/social footprint</li><li>Build brand awareness and familiarity with our target personas</li><li>Drive retargeting and email marketing</li></ol>



<p>But, keep in mind that this content, while valuable if used strategically, can also be a distraction from the key objective. It rarely leads to a product conversion.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Don’t let it become the center of your approach unless you have already built out every other part of the funnel in full.</p>



<h2>Top of the Funnel Content: Helping Prospects Solve Problems</h2>



<p>The top of the funnel is often misunderstood in the world of content marketing generally and SaaS, especially.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Our take is simple: <em>The top of the funnel starts when a buyer begins to actively learn about or seek a solution to problem that could lead to a purchase.</em><br></p>



<p>In the world of HelloSign, we see this as the pain point that the user is looking to solve that <em>could </em>ultimately lead to a product conversion.<br></p>



<p>If the buyer is a VP of Sales or Sales Operations Director, then they may begin their journey by looking to accelerate their sales cycle–cut down the days between contract and close.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>One solution to this problem is to implement esignatures.</em><br></p>



<p>So, from a content perspective, we target this initial need as an opportunity to capture the buyer at the point where they are looking for solutions to a problem. In my <a href="https://www.yesoptimist.com/saas-seo-strategy/">post about SaaS SEO</a>, I talked about our process of using a JTBD framework to identify and map these specific pain points to key product use cases and features.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Within the top of the funnel content, we break down our content strategy into <a href="http://yesoptimist.com/100k">3 key types of content that each serve a specific purpose</a>. I’ve outlined this approach before, but it allows us to get very specific and tactical while staying strategic in our content planning and creation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Social-viral content (Thought leadership)</h3>



<p>For HelloSign, what we pursue as social-viral content is strong thought leadership content that’s likely to generate a lot of shares and buzz around a particular topic.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>What we have found is that the more of a strong stance we are willing to take topics related to work, culture, and operations, the more reaction we generate among our target readers. Of course, this approach can be polarizing as well.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>22 June 2020</p>
<p>I was working on a project that required me pulling up the developer tools in different browsers against my personal website when I opened up Safari and noticed how drastically different the title of my page was rendering. It was extremely bold in Safari compared to the other browsers.</p>
<p>Much more bold than I expected it to be.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/browser-fonts/browser-fonts.png" alt="alt: Font rendering in, from top to bottom, Safari. Edge and Firefox"></p>
<p>I looked at my stylesheet and saw that I had applied minimal styling to my headings and recall a decision to just let the browser handle the heading styles apart from defining the <code>font-family</code> and <code>font-sizes</code>. So the difference in weight was be caused by the browser.</p>
<p><code>h1</code> tags are bold by default but there appears to be extra bold being applied by Safari.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jpamental">Jason Pamental</a> suggested using <code>font-synthesis: none;</code> but that didn't have any effect in Safari or Firefox (it's not supported in other browsers at the moment.)</p>
<h2 id="computed-styles">Computed Styles <a href="#computed-styles">#</a></h2>
<p>I started to dissect differences between the user agent style sheet and the Computed Styles tab in the DevTools.</p>
<p>Safari User agent stylesheet:</p>
<pre><code>h1 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Safari computed CSS properties</p>
<pre><code>h1 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox user agent stylesheet:</p>
<pre><code>h1 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox computed CSS properties</p>
<pre><code>h1 {
  font-weight: 700;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the computed tab, Edge, Chrome and Firefox are all showing <code>font-weight: bold</code> to be computed to a font-weight of 700, whereas Safari's computed font-weight doesn't have a numerical value, it just remains computed as "bold." But this still doesn't explain much.</p>
<p>In fact somewhat ironically, Safari doesn't have <code>font-weight: 700</code> defined anywhere in stylesheets that I can see in the DevTools but it <em>is</em> rendering <code>h1</code>s in the 700 font-weight for the typeface Poppins.</p>
<h2 id="browser-fallback-behavior">Browser fallback behavior <a href="#browser-fallback-behavior">#</a></h2>
<p>So now I'm even more baffled and look to the line of code I have to define the font and font-weights I'm using.</p>
<p><code>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:400,600" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></p>
<p>I don't know why, but I'm compelled to delete "600" from the string while in Edge. So I do and suddenly watch as the heading in Edge re-renders at "400".</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I add <code>,700</code> to the end of this string: <code>Poppins:400,600</code>. My heading re-renders and now matches Safari. I remove <code>,700</code> and it re-renders in the 600 font-weight. I delete 600 again, it re-renders in the 400 font-weight.</p>
<p>I test this in Firefox and see the same results.</p>
<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox all have a computed font-weight of 700 and if that particular font-weight isn't defined in the line of Google Fonts code, the browser grabs the next highest numerical font-weight that is defined and renders that font-weight as the bold weight. If you delete all font-weights from the Google Font code, you get the thinnest version of the font.</p>
<p>So what happens when I test this in Safari? Absolutely nothing. It doesn't matter if I delete all the font-weights from the font link. Safari's headings remain bold. But then I noticed something interesting as well after deleting the 400,600 from the font code...my nav bar on my website didn't change either in Safari.</p>
<p>So to confirm I was in fact seeing what I was seeing I changed the file on my live site and stripped 400,600 out so all I had was the following:</p>
<p><code>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/browser-fonts/thin-heading.png" alt="alt: Font rendering without any weight being defined"></p>
<p>And Safari didn't change at all. I still had the CSS for my nav links declaring them at <code>font-weight: 600</code> and Safari was still pulling that weight despite me not defining it in the font code.</p>
<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox had all fallen back to the thinnest font available.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-i-do-to-render-headings-consistently-across-browsers-and-platforms%3F">So what do I do to render headings consistently across browsers and platforms? <a href="#so-what-do-i-do-to-render-headings-consistently-across-browsers-and-platforms%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>This almost feels like a loaded question. This problem is almost akin (but a little bit less complex) to rendering HTML Forms consistently across platforms and browsers. The cross-platform problem is a harder one to solve as you can't control how the operating system handles font rendering.</p>
<p>If you don't want the browser to decide how to bold font-weights then I suggest explicitly defining the font-weight with numerical values: 500, 600, etc to avoid Firefox, Edge and Chrome falling back to whatever the highest font-weight defined is.</p>
<p>And a bit of a disclaimer: I've only looked at <code>h1</code> rendering for this article. I suspect there are many other areas one could dive into to compare other headings and paragraph rendering.</p>
<p>And the final question you may be wondering is this:</p>
<p>Which way is actually right? Firefox/Edge/Chrome or Safari?</p>
<p>And my answer is: I don't actually know.</p>
<p>Multiple browsers behaving the same isn't necessarily indicative of the correct implementation so I suspect I will be trying to dive into browser behavior to figure out the correct implementation at a later date.</p>

  <p>Published on 06 Jul 2020</p>
  
  <p>Go’s <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32825">infamous error handling</a> has caught quite the attention from outsiders to the programming language, often touted as one of the language’s most questionable design decisions. If you look into any project on Github written in Go, it’s almost a guarantee you’ll see the lines more frequently than anything else in the codebase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Although it may seem redundant and unnecessary for those new to the language, the reason errors in Go are treated as first-class citizens (values) has a deeply-rooted history in programming language theory and the main goal of Go as a language itself. Numerous efforts have been made to change or improve how Go deals with errors, but so far, one proposal is winning above all others:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QvF1AbH.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>- <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32825">Leave if err != nil alone!</a></p>

<h2 id="gos-error-philosophy">Go’s error philosophy</h2>

<p>Go’s philosophy regarding error handling forces developers to incorporate errors as first class citizens of most functions they write. Even if you ignore an error using something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span><span> </span><span>getUserFromDB</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>User</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>user</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>getUserFromDB</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Most linters or IDEs will catch that you’re ignoring an error, and it will certaintly be visible to your teammates during code review. However, in other languages, it may not be clear that your code is not handling a potential exception in a <code>try catch</code> code block, being completely opaque about handling your control flow.</p>

<p>If you handle errors in Go the standard way, you get the benefits of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No hidden control-flows</li>
  <li>No unexpected <code>uncaught exception</code> logs blowing up your terminal (aside from actual program crashes via panics)</li>
  <li>full-control of errors in your code as <em>values</em> you can handle, return, and do anything you want with</li>
</ol>

<p>Not only is the syntax of <code>func f() (value, error)</code> easy to teach to a newcomer, but also a standard in any Go project which ensures consistency.</p>

<p>It’s important to note Go’s error syntax does not <strong>force</strong> you to handle every error your program may throw. Go simply provides a pattern to ensure you think of errors as critical to your program flow, but not much else. At the end of your program, if an error occurs, and you find it using <code>err != nil</code>, and your application doesn’t do something actionable about it, you’re in trouble either way - <strong>Go can’t save you</strong>. Let’s take a look at an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>criticalDatabaseOperation</span><span>();</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>// Only logging the error without returning it to stop control flow (bad!)</span><span>
    </span><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Something went wrong in the DB: %w"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>saveUser</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"Could not save user: %w"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If something goes wrong and <code>err != nil</code> in calling <code>criticalDatabaseOperation()</code>, we’re not doing anything with the error aside from logging it! We might have data corruption or an otherwise unexpected issue that we are not handling intelligently, either via retrying the function call, canceling further program flow, or in worst-case scenario, shutting down the program. Go isn’t magical and can’t save you from these situations. Go only provides a standard approach for returning and using errors as values, but you still have to figure out how to handle the errors yourself.</p>

<h3 id="how-other-languages-do-it-throwing-exceptions">How other languages do it: throwing exceptions</h3>

<p>In something like the Javascript Node.js runtime, you can structure your programs as follows, known as throwing <code>exceptions</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>criticalOperation1</span><span>();</span>
    <span>criticalOperation2</span><span>();</span>
    <span>criticalOperation3</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If an error occurs in any of these functions, the stack trace for the error will pop up at runtime and will be logged to the console, but there is no explicit, programmatic handling of what went wrong.</p>

<p>Your <code>criticalOperation</code> functions don’t need to explicitly handle error flow, as any exception that occurs within that try block will be raised at runtime along with a stack trace of what went wrong.
A benefit to exception-based languages is that, compared to Go, even an unhandled exception will still be raised via a stack trace at runtime if it occurs. In Go, it is possible to not handle a critical error at all, which can arguably be much worse. Go offers you full control of error handling, but also <strong>full responsibility</strong>.</p>

<p>EDIT: Exceptions are definitely not the only way other languages deal with errors. Rust,  for example, has a good compromise of using option types and pattern matching to find error conditions, leveraging some nice syntactic sugar to achieve similar results.</p>

<h3 id="why-go-doesnt-use-exceptions-for-error-handling">Why Go doesn’t use exceptions for error handling</h3>

<h4 id="the-zen-of-go">The Zen of Go</h4>

<p>The Zen of Go mentions two important proverbs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simplicity matters</li>
  <li>Plan for failure, not success</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the simple <code>if err != nil</code> snippet to all functions which return <code>(value, error)</code> helps ensure failure in your programs is thought of <em>first and foremost</em>. You don’t need to wrangle with complicated, nested <code>try catch</code> blocks which appropriately handle all possible exceptions being raised.</p>

<h4 id="exception-based-code-can-often-be-opaque">Exception-based code can often be opaque</h4>

<p>With exception-based code, however, you’re forced to be aware of every situation in which your code could have exceptions without actually handling them, as they’ll be caught by your <code>try catch</code> blocks. That is, it encourages programmers to never check errors, knowing that at the very least, some exception will be handled automatically at runtime if it occurs.</p>

<p>A function written in an exception-based programming language may often look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>item</span> <span>=</span> <span>getFromDB</span><span>()</span>
<span>item</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span> <span>=</span> <span>400</span>
<span>saveToDB</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
<span>item</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span> <span>=</span> <span>'price changed'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code does nothing to ensure exceptions are properly handled. Perhaps the difference between making the code above become aware of exceptions is to switch the order of <code>saveToDB(item)</code> and <code>item.Text = 'price changed</code>, which is <strong>opaque</strong>, hard to reason about, and can encourage some lazy programming habits. In functional programming jargon, this is known as the fancy term: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28992625/exceptions-and-referential-transparency/28993780#28993780">violating referential transparency</a>. This <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=36693">blog post</a> from Microsoft’s engineering blog in 2005 still holds true today, namely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My point isn’t that exceptions are bad.
My point is that exceptions are too hard and I’m not smart
enough to handle them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="benefits-of-gos-error-syntax">Benefits of Go’s error syntax</h2>

<h3 id="easy-creation-of-actionable-error-chains">Easy creation of actionable error chains</h3>

<p>A superpower of the pattern <code>if err != nil</code> is how it allows for easy error-chains to traverse a program’s hierarchy all the way to where they need to be handled. For example, a common Go error handled by a program’s <code>main</code> function might read as follows:</p>

<p>[2020-07-05-9:00] ERROR: Could not create user: could not check if user already exists in DB: could not establish database connection: no internet</p>

<p>The error above is (a) clear, (b) actionable, (c) has sufficient context as to what layers of the application went <em>wrong</em>. Instead of blowing up with an unreadable, cryptic stack trace, errors like these that are a result of factors we can add human-readable context to, and should be handled via clear error chains as shown above.</p>

<p>Moreover, this type of error chain arises naturally as part of a standard Go program’s structure, likely looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// In controllers/user.go</span><span>
</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>CreateUser</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The beauty of the code above is that each of these errors are completely namespaced by their respective function, are informative, and only handle responsibility for what they are aware of. This sort of error chaining using <code>fmt.Errorf("something went wrong: %w", err)</code> makes it trivial to build awesome error messages that can tell you <em>exactly</em> what went wrong based on how <em>you</em> defined it.</p>

<p>On top of this, if you want to also attach a stack trace to your functions, you can utilize the fantastic <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/pkg/errors">github.com/pkg/errors</a> library, giving you functions such as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>errors</span><span>.</span><span>Wrapf</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"could not save user with email %s"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>email</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>which print out a stack trace <em>along</em> with the human-readable error chain you created through your code. If I could summarize the most important pieces of advice I’ve received regarding writing idiomatic error handling in Go:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add stack traces when your errors are actionable to developers</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do something with your returned errors, don’t just bubble them up to main, log them, and forget them</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep your error chains unambiguous</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When I write Go code, error handling is the one thing I <em>never</em> worry about, because errors themselves are a central aspect of every function I write, giving me full control in how I handle them safely, in a readable manner, and responsibly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“if …; err != nil” is something you’ll probably type if you write go. I don’t think it’s a plus or a negative. It gets the job done, it’s easy to understand, and it empowers the programmer to do the right thing when the program fails. The rest is up to you.</p>

            <p>Fractally broken a definition.</p>

<p><strong>Fractal</strong>: <em>A never ending pattern.</em><br><strong>Broken</strong>: <em>Not functioning properly.</em></p>

<p>This is a phrase I heard from <a href="https://kragniz.eu/">Louis Taylor</a> a few years ago and I absolutely love it. <em>Edit: I have been told that the original source may have been <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">https://eev.ee</a>.</em></p>

<p>It means that however much you zoom in or out from a thing it has faults. In an almost recursive manner.</p>

<p>It really sums up some projects. You look at the whole system and think some very bad words. Then you look at a component and think the same. Finally, you end up reading individual lines of code and the words continue flowing.</p>

<p>I also composed a limerick:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There once was a very bad project,</p>

  <p>With a fixed cost, scope and budget,</p>

  <p>It grew fractally broken,</p>

  <p>And the severs began smokin’,</p>

  <p>so none of the dev’s wanted to touch it.</p>

				        PGA is a <b>plane-based geometric algebra</b> which appears eminently suited for the description and computation of operations in <b>3D Euclidean geometry</b>. 
It naturally contains, in a real framework, efficient motion representations like homogeneous coordinates and  dual quaternions, fully integrated with oriented object models. 
PGA's encoding of primitives and operators in blocks of four coordinates makes it very suitable for <b>fast GPU
implementation</b>.</p><p>

To satisfy the curiosity raised by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX4H_ctggYo&amp;t=1080s" target="blank"><b>2019 SIGGRAPH</b></a> presentation on PGA, Leo Dorst decided to upgrade
<b>Chapter 11</b> of the 2007 book <a href="http://geometricalgebra.net/" target="blank"><b>Geometric Algebra for Computer Science (GA4CS)</b></a> to treat these new developments in a similarly precise but accessible style.
</p>
<p>

The present text assumes some <b>basic geometric algebra</b> knowledge (though it could be read without that, as a motivational inspiration to acquire that knowledge). 
Throughout, we try to be no more mathematical than required, and provide <b>illustrations</b> and links to <b>software demonstrations</b>.
</p><p>

This text takes care to propagate <b>orientational signs</b> and <b>scaling factors</b> through all its operations, since the author believes that PGA allows for such a consistently <b>oriented Euclidean geometry</b>. 
Guessing signs afterwards should no longer be required...</p><p>

Enjoy! We plan to post updates on new developments on this page, and in upgraded versions of this '<a href="https://bivector.net/PGA4CS.pdf">Guided Tour to the Plane-Based Geometric Algebra PGA</a>'.</p><p>

        Memory-sensitive languages like C++ and Rust use compile-time information to calculate
        sizes of datatypes. These sizes are used to inform alignment, allocation, and calling conventions in ways
        that improve runtime performance. Modern languages in this setting support generic types, but so far
        these languages only allow parameterisation over types, not type constructors. In this article I describe
        how to enable parameterisation over arbitrary type constructs, while still retaining compile-time calculation
        of datatype sizes.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<h3 id="generics">Generics</h3>

<p>Many typed languages support some form of generic (parameterised) datatypes. This ability to abstract
over types is known as ‘parametric polymorphism’ (polymorphism for short). In Rust, for example, one
can define type of polymorphic pairs as <code>struct Pair&lt;A, B&gt;(fst: A, snd: B)</code>. In this definition, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are type 
variables (or type parameters), and can be substituted for other types: 
<code>Pair&lt;bool, bool&gt;</code>, <code>Pair&lt;bool, char&gt;</code>, and <code>Pair&lt;String, int32&gt;</code> are all valid pairs.</p>

<p>The name of a type, without any parameters, is known as a type constructor. <code>Pair</code> is not a type on its own; 
<code>Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code> (for some types <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>) is. The number of types required to ‘complete’ a type constructor is known
as its arity (so <code>Pair</code> has arity 2). The arity of a type constructor must always be respected; it’s an error to 
provide greater or fewer type parameters than are expected. For example, <code>Pair&lt;bool&gt;</code> and 
<code>Pair&lt;char, int32, String&gt;</code> are invalid.</p>

<h3 id="sizing">Sizing</h3>

<p>When using C++ or Rust, the compiler will calculate how many bytes of memory each datatype requires. Simple
types like <code>int32</code> and <code>bool</code> have a constant size; 4 bytes and 1 byte respectively. The size of datatypes 
built using of other simple types is easy to calculate. The simplest way to calculate the size of a struct 
is to sum the sizes of the fields, and the simplest way to calculate the size of an enum (or tagged union)
is to find the largest variant, and add 1 (for a tag byte). This is rarely the exact formula used by production
compilers, because they take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment">alignment</a> into account.
This article will assume the simple sizing formula, because the results can easily be adapted to more nuanced
formulae.</p>

<p>The size of a datatype like <code>struct TwoInts(x: int32, y: int32)</code> is known immediately at its definition. <code>TwoInts</code>
requires 8 bytes of memory. On the other hand, the size of a generic datatype is not always known at its definition.
What is the size of <code>struct Pair&lt;A, B&gt;(fst: A, snd: B)</code>? It’s the size of <code>A</code> plus the size of <code>B</code>, for some 
unknown <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>

<p>This difficulty is usually addressed by only generating code for datatypes and functions when all the generic
types have been replaced with concrete types. This process is known as monomorphisation. If the program contains a 
<code>Pair(true, true)</code>, then the compiler will generate
a new type <code>struct PairBoolBool(fst: bool, snd: bool)</code> whose size is statically known. If <code>Pair(true, true)</code>
is passed to a function <code>fn swap&lt;A, B&gt;(p: Pair&lt;A, B&gt;) -&gt; Pair&lt;B, A&gt;</code>, then the compiler generates a new
function <code>fn swapBoolBool(p: PairBoolBool) -&gt; PairBoolBool</code>. Because this new function only uses types with known
sizes, the code for memory allocation and calling conventions can be generated correctly.</p>

<p>There are also generic types that <em>don’t</em> depend on the size of their parameters. An example of
this is the pointer, commonly known in Rust as <code>Box&lt;A&gt;</code>. A pointer has the same size (often 4 or 8 bytes depending
on your CPU) regardless of what it points to. But in order to allocate a new pointer, the size of the item must
be known.</p>

<p>For each generic datatype or function, the compiler keeps track of which type variables are important for sizing
calculations. The specifics of this is discussed in the <a href="#type-classes">Type Classes</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>A consequence of all this is that in these languages, type variables can only stand for types. But there
are good reasons to have type variables that stand for type constructors, too:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>
  <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are some 1-arity container types. The only difference between these datatypes is the number of elements
they contain. They all support a <code>map</code> operation, which applies a function to all the datatype’s elements. Functions
that use <code>map</code> need to be implemented once for each type, even when their implementations are identical:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>incrOne</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>incrTwo</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Two</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Two</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>incrThree</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To remedy this, there must first be a way to abstract over the type constructors, so that the code can
be written <em>once</em> and for all:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>incr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>F</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>// when F&lt;A&gt; has map, for all types A</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, there must be some way to rule out invalid types. For example, replacing <code>F</code> with <code>bool</code> in <code>F&lt;int32&gt;</code>
is invalid, because <code>bool&lt;int32&gt;</code> is not a type. This is the job of kinds<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Kinds describe the ‘shape’ of types (and type constructors) in the same way that types describe the ‘shape’ 
of values. A type’s kind determines whether or not it takes any parameters. Here’s the syntax of kinds:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kind ::=
  Type
  kind -&gt; kind
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Types that take no arguments (like <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, and <code>String</code>) have kind <code>Type</code>. Types that take one argument,
like <code>One</code>, have kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>. In the code for <code>incr</code> above, <code>F</code> implicitly has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>. Types
that take more than one argument are represented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curried form</a>. This
means that <code>Two</code> has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>, not <code>(Type, Type) -&gt; Type</code>. <code>Three</code> has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>,
and so on.</p>

<p>Curried type constructors are standard in this setting, but not <em>necessary</em>. The results in this article could
also be applied to a setting with uncurried type constructors, at cost to expressiveness or implementation complexity.</p>

<p>Kinds put types and type constructors on equal footing. For the remainder of the article, both concepts will be
referred to as types. The kind becomes the distinguishing feature. For example, “type constructor of arity 2” would
be replaced by “type of kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>”.</p>

<p>Some final jargon: types with a kind other than <code>Type</code> are known as ‘higher-kinded types’, and parameterising
over higher-kinded types is known as ‘higher-kinded polymorphism’.</p>

<h3 id="type-classes">Type Classes</h3>

<p>Rust uses <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html">traits</a> to coordinate sizing calculations. Each
datatype implicitly receives an implementation of the <code>Sized</code> trait, and every type variable that is relevant for
a sizing calculation is given a <code>Sized</code> bound. This means that trait resolution, an already useful feature, can
be re-used to perform size calculations.</p>

<p>Closely related to traits is the functional programming concept of type classes<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. There are differences between the two,
but those differences don’t impact the results of this article. Type classes will prove a more convenient language
in which to discuss these ideas.</p>

<p>A type class (or trait) can be considered a predicate on types. A type class constraint (or trait bound) is an assertion
that the predicate must be true. For each constraint that is satisfied, there is corresponding ‘evidence’ that the
predicate is true.</p>

<p>When a type <code>T</code> has a <code>Sized</code> constraint, it is being asserted that the statement “<code>T</code> has a known size” is true. For
brevity, this will be written as <code>Sized T</code>. When this statement satisfied (for instance, when <code>T</code> is <code>int32</code>), the
evidence is produced is <em>the actual size</em> of <code>T</code> (when <code>Sized int32</code> is satisfied, the evidence
is the number <code>4</code> - the size of <code>int32</code>).</p>

<p>Generic types like <code>Two&lt;A&gt;</code> have a size that depends on their type parameter. In terms of constraints, it can
be said that <code>Sized A</code> <em>implies</em> <code>Sized Two&lt;A&gt;</code>. If <code>A</code> is <code>int32</code>, then its size is <code>4</code>, which implies that
<code>Two&lt;int32&gt;</code> has a size of <code>4 + 4 = 8</code>. Similarly, of <code>Pair</code> it can be said that <code>Sized A</code> implies [ <code>Sized B</code> implies 
<code>Sized Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code> ]. There is a choice between a curried an uncurried version; it could also be said that
[ <code>Sized A</code> <em>and</em> <code>Sized B</code> ] implies <code>Sized Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code>, but the curried version will be used for convenience.</p>

<p>Note that type <em>constructors</em> don’t have a size. In other words, only types of kind <code>Type</code> have a size. A type constructor
such as <code>Two</code> (of kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>) has a size <em>function</em>. Given the sizes of the type constructor’s parameters,
a size function computes the size of the resulting datatype. <code>Two</code>’s size function is <code>\a -&gt; a + a</code>. <code>Pair</code>’s size
function <code>\a -&gt; b -&gt; a + b</code> (it could also be <code>\(a, b) -&gt; a + b</code> in an uncurried setting).</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>

<p>With the background out of the way, the specific problem can be stated:</p>

<p>When a type of kind <code>Type</code> is relevant for a size calculation, it is given a <code>Sized</code> constraint, which will be
satisfied with a concrete size as evidence. What is the equivalent notion of constraint and evidence for
higher-kinded types that contribute to size calculations?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>An elegant solution to this problem can found by introducing quantified class constraints<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Quantified constraints 
are an extension to type classes that add implication and quantification to the language of constraints, and corresponding
notions of evidence.</p>

<p>Here’s new syntax of quantified size constraints:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>constraint ::=
  Sized type               (size constraint)
  constraint =&gt; constraint (implication constraint)
  forall A. constraint     (quantification constraint)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The evidence for a constraint <code>c1 =&gt; c2</code> is a function that takes evidence for <code>c1</code> and produces evidence for <code>c2</code>, and the
evidence for <code>forall A. c</code> is just the evidence for <code>c</code>. The evidence for quantification constraints is a bit more nuanced
in general, but this description is accurate when only …</p></article></section></div>

    <p>Previously we took a look at <a href="https://aeonlucid.com/Snapchat-detection-on-Android/">Snapchat’s root detection methods on Android</a>. This time we are taking a look at how they detect jailbreaks, tweaks and hooks on iOS.</p>



<p>All the research in this post is based on Snapchat 10.65.0.66 (832559634).</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_login_message.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>This is the message you see when you try to login with a detected tweak, although not all tweaks trigger this message. Two examples that trigger this message are <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.johncoates.flex3/">Flex 3</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/9baacc/release_wraith_snapchatphantom_replacement/">Wraith</a>. Some just flag your account and will get you banned later in a ban wave if you are unlucky.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-bans">Avoiding bans</h2>

<p>So obviously the first thing we want to look at is, what has the community tried so far to stay hidden? If you google around a bit you will most likely end up with these result. For a few of them, I will list the most notable features.</p>

<ul>
  <li>NoSub (or variants)
    <ul>
      <li>Disable Cydia Substrate / Substitute entirely for specific apps.</li>
      <li>Only if you can find an updated version and don’t want to use tweaks on Snapchat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/NepetaDev/UnSub/blob/master/Tweak/Tweak.xm">UnSub</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Hooks and filters libc file system calls.</li>
      <li>Spoofs the libc getenv to remove the <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> variable.</li>
      <li>Spoofs <code>_dyld_image_count</code> and <code>_dyld_get_image_name</code> to hide tweak related dylibs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jjolano/shadow/blob/master/Tweak.xm">Shadow</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Too much to list.. it hooks way too much.</li>
      <li>Still misses lots of stuff for Snapchat specifically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/jailbroken-iphone">Snapchat themselves recommend NoSub</a>..</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_snapchat_jailbroken_support.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>But it seems that nobody knows what Snapchat is <strong>exactly</strong> doing to detect everything. Which is why I am writing this post. Only one that I have seen <a href="https://twitter.com/cokepokes/status/1023114963550797824">publicly making efforts</a> to figure this out is the developer of Phantom, CokePokes.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-they-doing-it">How are they doing it?</h2>

<p>I will try my best to explain every check they do in Snapchat 10.65.0.66.</p>

<p>When you launch the app they create a new thread using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html">pthread_create</a> that runs all the checks. At the end of these checks an integer is stored with flags of everything that was detected on the device. Some of these checks are then ran every 31 seconds.</p>

<p>All the code executed for these checks is obfuscated with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strong-codes">Snapchats in-house obfuscation tools</a> and thus very annoying to look at using tools such as IDA.</p>

<h3 id="code-signature-checks">Code signature checks</h3>

<p>One of the first things they do is checking and storing stuff from the code signature. This happens using the <code>sys_csops(169)</code> syscall, which is pretty much undocumented but is very similar to the code here.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They execute the following operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_ENTITLEMENTS_BLOB</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The most important one of this is the <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code>, this retrieves the current codesigning status of the process. A jailbroken device can respond with messy status flags. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_GET_TASK_ALLOW</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_INSTALLER</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_PLATFORM_BINARY</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DEBUGGED</code> (Process was debugged / is being debugged)</li>
  <li>Or missing <code>CS_VALID</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A normal device would have these flags:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_VALID</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_HARD</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_KILL</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_ENFORCEMENT</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_REQUIRE_LV</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DYLD_PLATFORM</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_SIGNED</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For all available flags and their descriptions, see <a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/BUILD/obj/EXPORT_HDRS/osfmk/kern/cs_blobs.h.html#_M/CS_VALID">this page</a>.</p>

<p>The result of <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code> and <code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code> are stored and later sent to the Snapchat servers, encrypted.</p>

<h3 id="bundle-check">Bundle check</h3>

<p>This is a simple check but quite effective if not noticed by a tweak developer. Pseudo code looks like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x0 = CFBundleGetMainBundle()
x1 = CFBundleGetIdentifier(x0)
x2 = CFStringGetCStringPtr(x1)
strncmp("com.toyopagroup.picaboo", x2)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dyld-check">Dyld check</h3>

<p>Snapchat has two methods to iterate all loaded dylibs.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h4>

<p>One way is using <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L48">dyld_get_image_header</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dladdr1.3.html">dladdr</a>. They iterate over <code>dyld_get_image_header</code> until it returns null and checks if it has seen everything with <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L47">dyld_image_count</a>. The <code>dladdr</code> method provides them with the path of the dylib. These are checked against a few unknown strings but removing everything substrate related from the dyld list fixes this check.</p>

<h4 id="second-attempt">Second attempt</h4>

<p>The other method they use is calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1537934-task_info">task_info</a> with flavor <code>TASK_DYLD_INFO</code>. This also gives them a list of all loaded dylibs and must be fixed separately from the first dyld check.</p>

<h3 id="file-system-checks">File system checks</h3>

<p>There are a couple of file system checks, of which all use the <code>sys_access(33)</code> syscall.</p>

<h4 id="first-list">First list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/Library/Application Support/PhLite/phlite.bundle/AuthAPI.pem</li>
  <li>/private/var/tmp/cydia.log</li>
  <li>/bin/bash</li>
  <li>/usr/sbin/sshd</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/ssh-keysign</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/sftp-server</li>
  <li>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</li>
  <li>/.installed_yaluX</li>
  <li>/Library/LaunchDaemons/dropbear.plist</li>
  <li>/usr/local/bin/dropbear</li>
  <li>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/enable-dylibs-to-override-cache</li>
  <li>/.cydia_no_stash</li>
  <li>/var/log/jailbreakd-stdout.log</li>
  <li>/etc/motd</li>
  <li>/usr/lib/libsubstitute.dylib</li>
  <li>/var/tmp/slide.txt</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="second-list">Second list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Ghay</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Snapchat.crc</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/embedded.mobileprovision</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="last-one-and-expected-to-exist">Last one (and expected to exist)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/PlugIns</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one makes it a bit harder to fix, since you can not simply replace the arm instructions with something that makes it always return false. Thus requiring an inline hook as replacement for the syscall so you gain full control over it.</p>

<h3 id="obj-c---class-checks">Obj-C - Class checks</h3>

<p>A lot of classes are checked from a lot of different tweaks. This is done using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SCOthmanPrefs</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOthmanSnapSaver</code></li>

  <li><code>yytp</code></li>
  <li><code>FLManager</code></li>
  <li><code>DecryptScriptAlertView</code></li>
  <li><code>DzAdsManager</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-checks">Obj-C - Method checks</h3>

<p>They also check methods. This happens using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a> and then <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418530-class_getinstancemethod">class_getInstanceMethod</a>. If any exists, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NSMutableString</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>a</code></li>
      <li><code>b</code></li>
      <li><code>c</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>SCAppDelegate</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>MZ42SGH98C:</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>SCOperaPageViewController</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>saveButtonPressed</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>UIViewController</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>dzDidTapGalleryButton</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-integrity-checks">Obj-C - Method integrity checks</h3>

<p>Next up is Snapchats own methods. For the classes listed below they first call <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418490-class_copymethodlist">class_copyMethodList</a>. Then for every <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/method?language=objc">Method</a> they check if the <code>IMP</code> pointer (address of the function) is within its own <code>__text</code> segment. This is how they detect whether a method has been hooked.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SCAppDelegate</code></li>
  <li><code>MainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatViewControllerV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCScreenshotDetector</code></li>
  <li><code>SCBaseMediaOperaPresenter</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOperaPageViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCLoginService</code></li>
  <li><code>SCAdsHoldoutExperimentContext</code></li>
  <li><code>SCExperimentManager</code></li>
  <li><code>SCCaptionDefaultTextView</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatTypingHandler</code></li>
  <li><code>Story</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMessageV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOperaViewersLayer</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to <code>dzan</code> for telling me to check the <code>__text</code> segment. :-)</p>

<h3 id="symbol-checks">Symbol checks</h3>

<p>They also check for a couple of symbols using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a>. If the result is not null, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>MSHookMessageEx</code></li>
  <li><code>MSHookFunction</code></li>
  <li><code>_Z17replaced_readlinkPKcPcm</code></li>
  <li><code>hooksArray</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_METACLASS_$__xxx</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_CLASS_$_PHSSaverV2</code></li>
  <li><code>plist</code></li>
  <li><code>flexBreakPoint</code></li>
  <li><code>convert_coordinates_from_device_to_interface</code></li>
  <li><code>OBJC_METACLASS_$_DzSnapHelper</code></li>
  <li><code>ChKey2</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="symbol-hook-checks">Symbol hook checks</h3>

<p>A few symbols are resolved using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a> to check whether they have been hooked. They first resolve <code>dlsym</code> using <code>dlsym</code>.. yeah.. That result gets used for the <code>dlsym</code> of the symbols below. For every address returned, the first 4 bytes are checked for common hook related instructions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>dlsym</code></li>
  <li><code>objc_getClass</code></li>
  <li><code>class_getInstanceMethod</code></li>
  <li><code>sel_registerName</code></li>
  <li><code>class_copyMethodList</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_image_count</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_get_image_header</code></li>
  <li><code>dladdr</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h3>

<p>I need to be honest, this is a very annoying way how they check for injection because it is annoying to fix. Instead of using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getenv.3.html">getenv</a> they use the <a href="http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=posix/environ.c">environ</a> variable. Since it is a variable, you can not “hook” it.</p>

<p>At least the following variables are detected.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/TweakInject.dylib</code></li>
  <li><code>_MSSafeMode=0</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sandbox-check">Sandbox check</h3>

<p>Probably not an issue for anyone.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_sandbox.png" alt="iOS sandbox">
</p>

<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>Not much detection done here but still relevant, using <code>sys_sysctl(202)</code> they request at least the following properties.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>kern.version</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.osversion</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.proc.pid.&lt;PID&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>hw.machine</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>The syscall <code>sys_proc_info(33)</code> is also called a couple of times, which could reveal stuff that is ptracing the process. They also use <code>sys_open(5)</code>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>, <code>sys_close(6)</code> and <code>sys_lstat64(340)</code> on the <code>Snapchat</code> binary. Probably to check for modifications or generating a checksum.</p>

<h2 id="how-all-this-stuff-was-found">How all this stuff was found</h2>

<p>A lot of the work was done using a small iOS emulator build on top of <a href="https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn">Unicorn</a>. Using an emulator you can see everything they do. Building this was also teached me a lot about the CoreFoundation library of iOS.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_emulator.png" alt="iOS emulator">
</p>

<p>Later I implemented a counter for all of my discoveries in a tweak called <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> while carefully keeping track of how my changes modified the detection flags and slowly getting rid of all of them. You can easily find fixes for checks mentioned in this blog post in the “Detections” directory.</p>

<p>You could alternatively trace the syscalls using any of the methods discussed in the WhoYouGonnaSyscall talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/hexploitable">Hexploitable</a>. Slides of the talk can be found <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/r2con2019/blob/master/talks/WhoYouGonnaSyscall/Hex-r2con2019-WhoYouGonnaSyscall.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-story-on-how-i-wasted-hours-on-fixing-syscalls">A story on how I wasted hours on fixing syscalls</h3>

<p>Let’s take <code>sys_access(33)</code> as an example. It’s implementation looks like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/access.2.html">this</a>. In short, when a file exists and permission is granted, return <code>0</code>. Otherwise return <code>-1</code>. First thing I did was force both of the results in my emulator but I saw no changes happening to the detection flags.</p>

<p>Later when implementing a fix for this in the <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> tweak, I was unable to have it fail. The arm instructions look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>MOV             X0, X27 ; path
MOV             X1, #0  ; mode
MOV             X16, #0x21
SVC             0x80    ; SYS_access
MOV             X0, #0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
CSEL            X0, X0, XZR, CS
MOV             X27, X0 ; Use result
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m not for a moment saying I’m right or wrong in the following views, and this is definitely not one of those posts about ‘how to write your CV to land your dream job’. I’m merely laying out the responses I had and more importantly what I felt these reponses told me about the person behind the CV. My ‘gut reaction’ may well be similar to others’ and if they are, it might be worth bearing them in mind when you share your CV.</p>

<h2 id="looks-count-more-than-i-thought">Looks Count More Than I Thought</h2>

<p>First, it wasn’t until I reached the ninth CV that I realised how much a CV’s appearance makes a difference. When viewing numbers one to eight I hadn’t been thinking ‘these look terrible’, but when I reached the ninth, a part of my brain said: ‘Finally! A CV that looks good.’</p>

<p>I think if the role was for a C++ programmer then I probably would have simply smiled to myself, ignored my response, and moved on. That’s not to say that appearance doesn’t matter–or that C++ programmers don’t worry about their appearance–but if I was trying to decide between two C++ programmers it wouldn’t be the look of their CV that was the deciding factor.</p>

<p>But the role for which I was reviewing this batch of CVs was a React developer and there are lots of very talented React developers out there. And when lots of people have worked with GraphQL and Docker and cloud services and D3 then it may well come down to whether or not you have made an effort to convey that you like things to ‘look nice’.</p>

<p>It’s worth saying too that the CVs that looked good didn’t go overboard; all they did was have a pleasing font, perhaps two columns instead of one for the layout, maybe a couple of icons and some colour, and probably didn’t span more than a couple of pages. But that was enough to convince me that these were people who would ensure that a bad-looking product didn’t get deployed.</p>

<h2 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</h2>

<p>Probably in the same vein, typos really jump out at you when you are looking at a lot of CVs. Again I’m not saying I’m right or wrong on whether this should be an important criteria, but the fact that my subconcscious reaction was to be turned off if I saw a spelling mistake–or a technology name that had been capitalised incorrectly–shows that somewhere in our psyches this stuff counts for something.</p>

<p>As with the previous point about looks, I’d probably see this as more relevant for front-end people.</p>

<p>And it might be worth saying that it’s usually not difficult to differentiate between those who have just not bothered to check their CV and those that have difficulty with spelling. I’ve worked with people in the latter camp, both senior managers and junior programmers, and it’s not a big deal–you can work with it and it would not stop me from hiring someone.</p>

<p>But to keep with the theme of my ‘initial reaction’, I can’t help that when I see someone write ‘Graphql’ I’m going to doubt whether the applicant really has that much experience with ‘GraphQL’; maybe it’s worth just double-checking the website of the technologies you use one last time, before sending off that CV.</p>

<h2 id="approaches-v-technologies">Approaches v. Technologies</h2>

<p>One other thing that I hadn’t expected was that I was drawn to mark people more highly if they gave some indication of the <em>approach</em> they took to their coding and development. For example, a few people mentioned having experience with TDD, which I thought was good. That doesn’t mean I’d rule out someone who didn’t have TDD experience, but it’s an approach that people need to be aware of.</p>

<p>However, more importantly than TDD, only a handful indicated that they liked to get involved in code reviews and saw them as a good way to share knowledge and build a consistent and high quality codebase. Again, I would not rule out someone who didn’t mention code reviews, mentoring, and so on, provided they were relatively inexperienced; but I probably <em>would</em> rule out someone who clearly has experience, but hasn’t thought to mention these things.</p>

<h3 id="approach-from-technologies">Approach From Technologies</h3>

<p>What I was also surprised by was how the list of technologies on a person’s CV led to me forming an impression of the kind of coder that person was. If I saw GraphQL in the mix then I found myself thinking ‘modern tech stack’. It may be unfair, especially since GraphQL wasn’t mentioned in the job description that was circulated; but after reviewing all of the CVs I found that it was a pretty accurate indicator of the types of projects someone had been involved in.</p>

<p>There were other technologies that were similarly indicative, such as mention of ‘microservices’, or use of MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, and so on. But there were very few CVs where these technologies appeared without GraphQL.</p>

<p>There is probably no general rule here, since the technologies that differentiate will be different in each cohort of CVs; if every CV included GraphQL then it may have been the presence of something like Docker and/or Kubernetes that told you something about the kind of people you were looking at.</p>

<h2 id="public-profile">Public Profile</h2>

<p>This last point may also be controversial, but I’m going to describe it so that you can do whatever you like with the information; if someone was not on LinkedIn or didn’t have a public Git account, I found myself thinking ‘well, what exactly do they do?’</p>

<p>From this batch of 22 CVs, only one had answered any questions on Stack Overflow, and only one–a different person–had done any talks at Meetups. A couple had GitHub accounts, a couple were on LinkedIn and a couple had blogs.</p>

<p>This is no doubt unfair, so again, blame my subconscious. But I can’t help think that if I’m going to work with some people day after day, I want to be with people that are sharing links to things they’ve read, people who are trying out new technologies and languages, people who have weekend projects, or who are contributing bug fixes back to open source projects.</p>

<p>And although I’m not particularly a big fan of LinkedIn, I always quite like it when I see people who are at the early stages of their career making connections with everyone they met at last night’s Meetup.</p>

<p>None of this is to ignore the current discussion about work/life balance–to demand that people do their own education in their own time, spend all waking hours coding, attend Meetups every night of the week. But it is to recognise that we are in a fast-moving industry, and if you want your CV to be picked from amongst that batch of 22, then it’s going to be important to think about how you come across.</p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

<p>One final thing has just occurred to me…I didn’t consider the qualifications of <em>anyone</em>, which I imagine is down to the role that the CVs were for. You’d certainly be interested in degrees and PhDs if you were hiring a data scientist or someone to write an operating system; in these spaces theory is a major element. But for fast-moving technologies like front-end development, you can probably tell everything about a person from their experience.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I haven’t had to look at CVs for quite a while, so it was interesting to examine my own responses to reviewing this batch. What became clear is that I quickly ‘merged’ the CV and the person in my mind. If there were mistakes in the CV I couldn’t help but imagine someone who lacked attention to detail. If there was a little bit of colour in the CV or the person had spoken at a Meetup then I couldn’t help but think that this was a person who was prepared to go the extra mile. And if the person had a public Git account then my spontaneous reaction was that this was someone who wanted to keep learning, and really enjoyed the work they do.</p>

<p>I may be wrong in my judgements or harsh in my conclusions, but if you’re about to send your CV out, at least you now have a couple more insights that might help you decide how your CV is representing you.</p>

    <p>
      Symbolic execution with SymCC: Don't interpret, compile!
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the 29th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 20),
    Boston, MA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      A major impediment to practical symbolic execution is speed, especially
      when compared to near-native speed solutions like fuzz testing. We propose
      a compilation-based approach to symbolic execution that performs better
      than state-of-the-art implementations by orders of magnitude. We present
      SymCC, an LLVM-based C and C++ compiler that builds concolic execution
      right into the binary. It can be used by software developers as a drop-in
      replacement for <tt>clang</tt> and <tt>clang++</tt>, and we show how to
      add support for other languages with little effort. In comparison with
      KLEE, SymCC is faster by up to three orders of magnitude and an average
      factor of 12. It also outperforms QSYM, a system that recently showed
      great performance improvements over other implementations, by up to two
      orders of magnitude and an average factor of 10. Using it on real-world
      software, we found that our approach consistently achieves higher
      coverage, and we discovered two vulnerabilities in the heavily tested
      OpenJPEG project, which have been confirmed by the project maintainers and
      assigned CVE identifiers.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymCC is a fast compiler-based symbolic execution engine. On this page, we
    provide SymCC's source code, the raw results of the experiments described in
    the paper, as well as instructions how you can replicate those experiments
    yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymCC is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symcc">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe two sets of experiments: we first benchmark SymCC
    on the CGC programs, then we run it on real-world software. This section
    describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides links to our
    results.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        CGC experiments (our results
        for <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_pure_time.csv">pure
        execution
        time</a>, <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_concolic_time.csv">concolic
        execution time</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_concolic_coverage.tar.gz">coverage</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We used the <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/cb-multios">Linux
          port</a> of the CGC programs by Trail of Bits. SymCC needs to be built
        with support for 32-bit compilation (see <tt>docs/32-bit.txt</tt>;
        this is not part of the Dockerfile because it would double the build
        time of the container while providing value to just a few users). Then
        you can simply export
        <tt>CC=/path/to/symcc</tt>, <tt>CXX=/path/to/sym++</tt> and <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt>, and
        build the CGC programs as usual (i.e., by invoking their build.sh script).
      </p>

      <p>
        Run the programs on the raw PoV inputs
        with <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt> to measure pure execution
        time, and unset the environment variable for symbolic execution. To
        assess coverage, we ran <tt>afl-showmap</tt> with the
        AFL-instrumented CGC programs on each generated input and accumulated
        the resulting coverage maps per program, resulting in a set of covered
        map entries for each CGC program. The sizes of those sets can then be
        fed to the scoring formula presented in the paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        For KLEE and QSYM, we used the setup
        described <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/ir_study.html">here</a> but with the regular 32-bit
        binaries built by cb-multios.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        The analysis of real-world software always follows the same procedure.
        Assuming you have exported <tt>CC=symcc</tt>, <tt>CXX=sym++</tt>
        and <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt>, first download the code,
        then build it using its own build system, finally
        unset <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT</tt> and analyze the program in
        concert with AFL (which requires building a second time for AFL,
        see <tt>docs/Fuzzing.txt</tt>). We used AFL 2.56b and built the
        targets with <tt>AFL_USE_ASAN=1</tt>. Note that the fuzzing helper
        is already installed in the Docker container.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg.git">OpenJPEG</a>
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_openjpeg.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we used revision <tt>1f1e9682</tt>, built with CMake as
          described in the project's <tt>INSTALL.md</tt>
          (adding <tt>-DBUILD_THIRDPARTY=ON</tt> to make sure that third-party
          libraries are compiled with SymCC as well), and
          analyzed <tt>bin/opj_decompress -i @@ -o /tmp/image.pgm</tt>; the
          corpus consisted of test
          files <a href="https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data/blob/master/input/conformance/file1.jp2">file1.jp2</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data/blob/master/input/conformance/file8.jp2">file8.jp2</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive.git">libarchive</a>
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_libarchive.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we used revision <tt>9ebb2484</tt>, built with CMake as
          described in the poject's <tt>INSTALL</tt> (but
          adding <tt>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release</tt>), and
          analyzed <tt>bin/bsdtar tf @@</tt>; the corpus consisted of just a
          single dummy file containing the character "A".
        </li>

        <li>
          tcpdump
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_tcpdump.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we built both tcpdump and libpcap; in order to make the
          former find the latter, just place the source directories next to each
          other in the same folder. We used revision <tt>d615abec</tt>
          of <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap.git">libpcap</a>
          and revision <tt>d57927e1</tt>
          of <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump.git">tcpdump</a>.
          We built first libpcap and then tcpdump with <tt>./configure
          &amp;&amp; make</tt>, and analyzed
          <tt>tcpdump/tcpdump -e -r @@</tt>; the corpus consisted of just a single dummy
          file containing the character "A".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All experiments used one AFL master process, one secondary AFL process,
        and one SymCC process. We let them run for 24 hours and repeated each of
        them 30 times to create the graphs in the paper; AFL map density was
        extracted from the secondary AFL process' <tt>plot_data</tt> file,
        column <tt>map_size</tt>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The QSYM experiments used an analogous setup, replacing SymCC with QSYM
        and running it with AFL according to the QSYM
        authors' <a href="https://github.com/sslab-gatech/qsym#run-hybrid-fuzzing-with-afl">instructions</a>.

				<p><em>"Work on important problems": ~40900 results.</em></p>
<p><em>"Work on unimportant problems": ~18 results.</em></p>
<p><em>– Google (at the time of writing), tempting the contrarian in me</em></p>
<p>It seems obvious that some problems are important to solve and some aren't, as in, curing cancer is more important than delivering social gaming. Often, people <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-golden-age-of-silicon-valley-is-over-and-were-dancing-on-its-grave/257401/">lament</a> the abundance of tech firms working on ultimately unimportant stuff, and <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.il/2011/07/hacker-news-fires-steve-yegge.html">advise</a> to work on important problems and not just chase the money.</p>
<p>I guess I agree that some problems are ultimately more important than others. But I don't think it follows that working on the important ones is better.</p>
<p>Working on unimportant problems can create important side-effects. A whole lot of mission-critical, world-changing and even life-saving tech is a by-product of "unimportant" things – time-wasting infotainment products, or personal pet projects started without a grand noble cause.</p>
<p>For instance, GPU hardware was developed to run first-person shooters with increasingly fancier graphics. Today, it powers some of the largest high-performance computing clusters where "important" science is done.</p>
<p>Other types of processors powering HPC clusters weren't designed for HPC, either. Hardware originally designed for scientific computing is dead – Cray is the iconic example – and replaced by cheaper and more powerful microprocessors designed to run things like office software. Office software arguably solves no important problem: as Berglas convincingly <a href="http://www.berglas.org/Articles/ImportantThatSoftwareFails/ImportantThatSoftwareFails.html">argues</a>, office automation results not in increased productivity, but in increased complexity of rules and regulations.</p>
<p>All popular programming languages and operating systems, without a single exception I can think of, began either as personal projects or commercial projects not aiming to solve any problem "important" by itself. People hacked on the stuff for pleasure (C, Unix, Linux, Python, Ruby, PHP), or to conquer the world of businessy/officy/enterprisey software (Windows, VB, Java, C#, ASP). One language more specifically designed for the implementation of important software is Ada – but most important programs are written in something else.</p>
<p>It can even seem that not much important computer hardware or software came out of institutions directly dealing with important problems. Much of the Internet protocols is one big exception, and arguably so is HTML – but probably not JavaScript.</p>
<p>And, certainly, it's the "unimportant" social companies that made publishing and coordination via Internet universally accessible. Myself, I'm not very fond of either Facebook, Twitter, etc. or the kind of political activity that's coordinated through these sites nowadays, but it's "important", without doubt – another important side-effect of unimportant time-wasting projects.</p>
<p>One might wonder how anything of importance can possibly come out of, say, FarmVille. I really don't know – however, I couldn't guess how anything of importance could come out of DOOM, and it did.</p>
<p>And then there's a reason why so much of the best tech comes out of the least "important" markets. These markets are big, and they're free. Important problems tend to imply a smallish scale, or heavy regulation, or both. So you can't finance the work, and/or can't get any work done anyway.</p>
<p>Consider the aerospace software market – there aren't many planes, but a whole lot of regulation. Philip Greenspun, a software entrepreneur, a flight instructor and an expert witness&nbsp;in both&nbsp;<a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/software/expert-witness">software-related</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/aviation-expert-witness">aviation-related</a> lawsuits, had&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2010/02/09/public-tv-figures-out-how-to-fly-regional-airliners/">this</a> to say about the Colgan 3407 disaster:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who crashed Colgan 3407? Actually the autopilot did. …&nbsp;The airplane had all of the information necessary to prevent this crash. The airspeed was available in digital form. The power setting was available in digital form. The status of the landing gear was available in digital form. …</p>
<p>How come the autopilot software on this $27 million airplane wasn’t smart enough to fly basically sensible attitudes and airspeeds? Partly because FAA certification requirements make it prohibitively expensive to develop software or electronics that go into certified aircraft. It can literally cost $1 million to make a minor change. Sometimes the government protecting us from small risks exposes us to much bigger ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same is happening in the automotive market, the healthcare market, etc. There's progress, of course, just nowhere near the progress in more frivolous areas – and much of the progress in "important" areas is a byproduct of progress in frivolous areas. As in, the best system for managing patients' records may well be Google Docs that doctors access from their iPads.</p>
<p>By the way, the importance of an issue correlates with the stupidity of rules, not just in technology, but in most things in life. The hoops you must jump through to get an "important" product out the door are not fundamentally different from airport security checks.</p>
<p>The airport security theater results in little added security. Likewise, the quality theater necessarily surrounding any life-saving technology results in little added quality. However, for much the same reasons, both are unavoidable.&nbsp;I've been working on automotive accident prevention systems for the last decade, and as time goes by, the regularly scheduled cavity searches are only getting worse.</p>
<p>So if you ask me – by all means, work on unimportant problems. They're often more fun to work on, and ultimately you never know how important they really are.</p>

            <p>I was always a fan of the steampunk style, and having also had experience building steam engines in the past, there was only one real direction this project could go. Once I had my radiation detector kit hooked up to my Raspberry Pi running InfluxDB and Grafana, I found myself woodworking, machining, and fabricobbling an enclosure out of mahogany, brass, copper, toggle switches and, because it just had to be done, nixie tubes.</p>

<p>Read the story of the almost year-long journey (<em>cough</em> some other stuff cropped up…) I went on to make my steampunk vision a reality below, and if you want to get up and running quickly, find out how to <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-simple-radiation-monitor-using-a-raspberry-pi-influxdb-and-grafana/">build your own simple version right here</a>!</p>

<h2 id="introductionspanidintrospan">Introduction <span id="intro"></span></h2>

<p>Low cost radiation monitors and Geiger counter kits have been available online for around $30-50US/£25-45 for a while, but standing alone they don’t do much other than make the recognizable “clicking” sound we all know from movies and TV. I decided to up the ante by connecting one to a Raspberry Pi, storing the data with InfluxDB, and showing the readings with a Grafana dashboard.</p>



<p>I updated the tech, gave it a web interface, added remote management, and built a custom mahogany housing with brass and copper fittings to show everything off, because it’s important to look suitably <em>hip</em> when sitting on the desk next to your <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-raspberry-pi-powered-train-station-oled-sign-for-your-desk/">train sign</a>… right?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/header.jpg" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(58)">  
</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m gonna show what I built to hopefully provide some inspiration, then show you how to get up and running with a simpler version of the project that anyone can build at home without any special tools. Let’s hit this.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="inspirationdesignspanidinspirationspan">Inspiration &amp; design <span id="inspiration"></span></h2>

<p>I’ve always found the idea of radiation fascinating; how there are invisible particles moving around at incredibly high speeds, crashing into things and flipping bits all around us. Due to my fascination, it doesn’t take a lot to capture my interest when it comes to this field.</p>

<p>One day last year I was reminiscing over the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44606771">now defunct</a> UK-based electronics retailer Maplin, and how they sold all sorts of interesting kits for the aspiring engineer. This led me to <a href="https://www.richardmudhar.com/blog/2019/09/maplin-geiger-counter/">Richard Mudhar’s blog</a> where he tells the story of the <em>Maplin Geiger Counter</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/mudhar-example.png" alt="An excerpt and image from Richard Mudhar's post"></p>

</figure>

<p>The kit that Richard has built above features both an electromechanical counter on the left, and two rings of LEDs reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekatron">dekatron tubes</a> on the right. This display has the neat design feature that as the rate of count increases, the display becomes more noticeable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/dekatron.gif" alt=""></p>

</figure>

<p>I liked the idea of combining the modern technology on the inside (Raspberry Pi, Grafana, etc.) with the timeless look of brass, copper, toggle switches, dark hardwood, and glass on the outside. The idea was now to build something that looked old and had that distinctive steampunk style, but was up to date and Internet-connected.</p>

<p>In addition to the total absolute count like the old Maplin counter, I wanted to offer a live display of the counts per minute (CPM) reading, and what better way to do this than with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">Nixie tubes</a>, to get that nice warm orange glow and keep things looking cosy.</p>

<p>I started scribbling down ideas and thoughts of materials I wanted to use alongside shopping lists for parts, and possible designs for the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/notes.jpg" alt="Original shop notes!"></p>

<figure>  
Notes don’t survive well in a machine shop, but these are what’s left of my original sketches.  
</figure>

<p>This process was very much led by an image I had in my mind about how the thing should look and feel and so I just had to make it real… somehow.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="thebuildspanidbuildspan">The build <span id="build"></span></h2>

<p>With some thoughts and ideas scribbled down it was time to get started. As this is for the most part going to be a bespoke, hand-built item, and made up as I go along, it’s not necessary to put everything in CAD. There are of course some core items that exist already and cannot change size; the Raspberry Pi and radiation detector board, for example. These are off-the-shelf parts that have to fit in the box no matter what, and start to dictate the size of the final unit.</p>

<p>Almost all other parts are completely hand made, machined and fabricated. This was necessitated by the desire to make everything authentic; I didn’t want to build things just for looks, I wanted any design choices made for aesthetic reasons to also be functional; by this I mean when I put 18 screws in something to make it look good, they are going to be 18 <em>real</em> screws that you have to take out to gain access!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Each of the build log images link to a separate gallery when clicked. You can look through the images that way if you prefer, or read on in full detail.</p>

<h3 id="thefrontpanelspanidpanelspan">The front panel <span id="panel"></span></h3>

<p>I started with the front panel of the housing, I knew I wanted two toggle switches; one for power and one for sound (to disable the clicking noise), along with 3 nixie tubes to display the CPM up to 999. Normal background radiation is in the range of about 25-75 CPM, so I figured if background radiation is above 999 CPM, we have bigger problems than worrying about enough digits on the counter.</p>



<p>The two front panel pieces are made from 6mm thick mild steel plate, cut to size with an angle grinder and then milled to dimension with the help of Bridget, the Bridgeport. Holes are then cut for the nixies and the toggle switches.</p>



<p>I manufactured labels for each by hand-punching lettering into 0.5mm thick brass sheet, polishing and fixing with M2 screws. The steel pieces are coated with a clear lacquer to prevent corrosion.</p>

<h3 id="workingwithwoodspanidwoodspan">Working with wood <span id="wood"></span></h3>

<p>Wood isn’t my favourite material to work with, I mean it just changes shape of its own accord! Who can work with that?! Anyhow, it’s very pretty, and so it was decided that the outer box should be made of hardwood. I started with a scrap piece of mahogany, cut it to halve the thickness on the bandsaw, and then set about planing and shaping the sides of the box to fit the dimensions of the Raspberry Pi (3A+) and the radiation detector.</p>



<p>The dimensions of the front panel along with the steel faceplates were planned out in Fusion 360 so that I could print a cutting and drilling template. This was taped onto the planed piece of mahogany, the holes for screws were drilled, and the openings for components cut out.</p>



<p>The pieces were cut at 45 degree angles to enable a mitre joint in each corner. The joints were reinforced with biscuits (mmm biscuits), and then the 4 sides were glued and clamped and allowed to cure overnight.</p>



<p>The top and bottom of the case are made from the same scrap mahogany, but planed a lot thinner - approximately 6mm, the same as the steel plate.</p>

<h3 id="topbrassspanidbrassspan">Top brass <span id="brass"></span></h3>

<p>I had the idea that it would look good to hold the box together with a totally unnecessary amount of screws, 36 to be exact; 18 on top and 18 on the bottom. To prevent the screws damaging the wood surface and to add some extra detail to the top of the case I decided to make a brass plate that the screws all go through to clamp the top cover down.</p>



<p>Some pieces of 2mm brass strip were cut, mitred on the corners and soldered together. Once soldered, sanded and polished, the joints are barely visible.</p>



<p>Holes for screws were then drilled, and the brass plate used to secure the oversize lid to the box whilst it was sanded to size on a drum sander. I later learned that using a drum sander for this was a mistake as it marked the sides of the box, but you live and learn!</p>

<h3 id="imitationdekatronsspaniddekatronsspan">Imitation Dekatrons <span id="dekatrons"></span></h3>

<p>My attempt at imitating the Dekatron tube effect starts with a piece of 50mm stainless steel (or aluminium) bar. The bar is turned on a lathe down to 40mm, and to have a cavity for the electronics. The work is removed from the lathe and parted off on a bandsaw before being returned to the lathe to have a hole drilled in the rear for cabling to drive the LEDs.</p>



<p>The part is then put on the milling machine to have 10 holes drilled and M2 <del>taps snapped off in the holes</del> threaded ready to fasten the faceplate.</p>



<p>The brass faceplate is made from the same 0.5mm thick brass sheet as the labels from the faceplates. Each piece is drilled with 20 holes (10 for LEDs, 10 for fasteners), and then hand stamped with the numbering for each LED.</p>

</div>

<p>The LEDs are wired with a common ground and connected using a piece of recycled floppy disk drive ribbon cable. All the work is then carried out a second time for the ‘X10’ display. The eagle-eyed readers will notice that the second display is made from a different material than the first - this is due to the fact I snapped both a drill bit and a tap off in the M2 holes - working with stainless steel with these small tools is very difficult! I ended up making the second from aluminium, which machines like butter, in comparison.</p>



<p>Throughout the development of this project I found myself continually swapping fasteners and trying different combinations to see what looks best. The end result is a mix of M2 and M3 metric machine screws in both brass and stainless steel, cheese head and countersunk head, all slotted. You may notice that in earlier photos some of the parts were assembled with Allen-head cap screws but these were later swapped out. Ebay is usually a great place to get small quantities of fasteners of all different shapes and sizes.</p>

    <p>Did you ever dream about creating your own chip?
I mean, a physical chip.
One which you can hold in your hand, and which does exactly what you’ve designed it to do?</p>

<p>Until today, there were two major road blocks: you had to get access to a process design kit (PDK) from a chip manufacturing house (a foundry), and you had to have enough money to actually pay for the manufacturing.
These times are over.
Today.</p>

<p>Today, in a FOSSi Dial-Up talk, Tim Ansell of Google announced <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">SkyWater PDK</a>, the first manufacturable, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit">process design kit</a>.
What differentiates this PDK from previous attempts is the fact that it is manufacturable: with this PDK, you can actually produce chips with the <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/">SkyWater foundry</a> in the 130nm node.</p>

<p>That leaves you as chip designer only with one road block: money.
Manufacturing chips is expensive – even for more than a decade old nodes like the 130nm node, you need to spend at least a couple thousand dollars.</p>

<p>You know what?
Don’t worry – Google and efabless have got you covered!
They are providing <strong>completely free of cost</strong> chip manufacturing runs: one in November this year, and multiple more in 2021.
All open source chip designs qualify, no further strings attached!</p>

<p>Learn more about all of that by re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EczW2IWdnOM">Tim’s Dial-Up talk</a> or click through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtwZPc8ykkkgtUkHkoJZrP9jKOo3FYdKqbg-So0ic6_kx7ha1vHnxrWmuxWkTc9GfC8xl0TfEpMLwK/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">slides</a>.</p>

<p>This is certainly a dream come true for us at the FOSSi Foundation.
We helped the Free and Open Source Silicon community, our community, grow and tackle huge challenges over the years.
An open, manufacturable PDK was the main blocker in a fully open flow between RTL and a physical chip, and we’re extremely excited to see that blocker removed.</p>

<p>As always, removing one roadblock only highlights more challenges:
RAM, ROM and flash compilers, analog blocks, optimizations to various tools, and much, much more.
Now is the perfect time to get involved in the Free and Open Source Silicon ecosystem – or learn more about the accomplishments and challenges ahead of us.
A good starting point are the next Dial-Up talks.</p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/dial-up/">Dial-Up web site</a> for a listing of the upcoming talks on OpenROAD, cell design, OpenRAM, and Magic, an old, but surprisingly up-to-date tool!

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-datetime.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>Gates was having an informal meeting with Steve Shaiman, a cheerful gnome of a man with a head of frizzy hair who was general manager of Microsoft’s hardware division, and with Raleigh Roark one of the two people who had started the division. They were talking about fonts and applications, especially Word.</p>

<p>Roark gave Gates his answer: For printers, basically. This was the era of desktop publishing and proliferating office applications, and users needed more than just the bitmapped system fonts on their computers to get their work done. Courier, Tms Rmn, and Helv were not going to be enough. </p>

<p>Bill Gates is known for asking hard questions, but also for accepting hard answers and acting on them. As soon as he got his answer, he pointed at Steve and told him: “Now you run type!”</p>

<p>That’s the way things worked at Microsoft in those days, says Shaiman: whoever knew the most about a subject tended to end up in charge of it. So he ended up starting Microsoft’s first fonts group. It was Spring, 1989.</p>

				<h2>The conquest of TrueType</h2>
			</section>
			
			<section data-blockname="body_copy">
				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-phone.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN was on a business trip to Atlanta with Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft’s celebrated head of advanced technology, when they got an unexpected phone call. Myhrvold had with him a satellite phone—an early mobile phone, “which in those days,” as Shaiman put it, “meant something you’d carry in a suitcase.” The unexpected call was from Apple.</p>

<p>At that time, Adobe Systems dominated the digital font market, with its PostScript technology built into Apple’s LaserWriter printers, and with PostScript firmly established as the preferred format for high-quality fonts. Microsoft needed to find its own format and its own fonts if it didn’t want to be dependent on Adobe.</p>

<p>Like Microsoft, Apple was trying to find ways to license the PostScript language from Adobe, or to find an alternative. The Apple call was about font technology: Apple was developing its own font format, TrueType, as an alternative to PostScript, while Microsoft acquired a program called TrueImage, a potential PostScript clone, which Apple was interested in. How about a trade?</p>

<p>Shaiman says that his and Nathan Myhrvold’s reaction was immediate: “Sure!”</p>

<p>Ironically, once Microsoft got hold of TrueType, they loved the concept but didn’t like the way it was implemented. Although they ended up only making slight modifications to the version that shipped with Windows 3.1, when it came time for the next version of Windows, they ended up “throwing out Apple’s code and rewriting it from scratch.”</p>

<p>When Microsoft and Apple publicly announced their collaboration on TrueType at the Seybold conference in September 1989, the announcement was handled in a contentious and aggressive manner that antagonized Adobe and famously brought Adobe’s John Warnock to tears of frustration. Steve Shaiman feels now that it was a poor way to do it: “We couldn’t have done worse.” Although they were demonstrating what they felt was better technology, they made the mistake of shoving it in Adobe’s face. “What we really needed,” he says, “was a good PR person who could have helped us come up with a less aggressive approach.” But the deed was done. The “font wars” were in full swing.</p>

<p>The key developer of Microsoft’s new code was Eliyezer Kohen, whom Myhrvold met at a conference in Switzerland. Eliyezer was, as Steve Shaiman put it, “really, really smart.” He had a PhD from ETH Zurich, where he studied with Hans Eduard Meyer, the designer of the font Syntax, and Niklaus Wirth, designer of the Pascal language; and he developed his own technology for creating scalable fonts. Eliyezer, according to Shaiman, was “a Turkish Jew with a German wife, who wanted to move to the United States, as one or the other of them wasn’t welcome in any country in Europe where they might find decent working conditions.” Microsoft happily brought him in.</p>

			<section data-blockname="body_copy">
				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-dosscreen.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>GREG HITCHCOCK was one of the early members of what he calls the “virtual team” that Shaiman and Dennis Adler put together in early 1990 to deal with fonts. Hitchcock is tall, blond, and slow-spoken; he doesn’t fit the image of the high-energy Microsoft employee, and he may seem unassertive, almost tentative, if you see him only in a neutral context. But when you see his attention snap to the subjects he knows and cares about, he is forceful and precise, and very, very knowledgeable. His memory is encyclopedic, and he has been at the heart of Microsoft’s typographic development for more than a quarter century. Today he manages Microsoft’s Advanced Reading Technologies (ART) team.</p>

<p>Although Microsoft had been dealing with fonts in one way or another from the very beginning (even a DOS screen needs a font to display its text), Hitchcock feels that the story of typography at Microsoft really begins here: When the first outline fonts were created for Windows 3.1, in 1990.</p>

<p>It was all brand-new technology. All fonts up until then had been bitmap fonts, crude forms made up of coarse screen pixels in a vague approximation of what real letters looked like. Although Microsoft’s new effort was driven by purely practical needs—mapping the screen fonts on a computer system to the fonts available on a printer—Hitchcock feels that it was also the beginning of thinking about screen fonts as something useful and readable in themselves.</p>

<p>The members of the virtual team came from all over Microsoft: Dennis Adler (Fonts), Jean-François Peyroux (OS/2, and later Windows), Michel Suignard (Windows International), Greg Hitchcock (OS/2), Eliyezer Kohen (Fonts), David Weise (Windows), Tim McCaffery (Windows), Raleigh Roark (Hardware), Gabe Newell (Printing), and later Ben Bauermeister, an outside consultant, whose “PANOSE system” for classifying typefaces by their visual characteristics (rather than their historical roots) might provide a roadmap between screen and print.</p>

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-shake.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN hired Dennis Adler to manage the fonts groups.&nbsp; Together, they talked with several potential sources of font libraries and font technologies, including most of the big guns in the field. Linotype, the venerable manufacturer of hot-metal typesetting equipment, which owned the rights to, among others, the very popular typeface Helvetica, was being hard-nosed. “Fonts were seen as incredibly valuable at the time,” says Shaiman, “and Linotype’s attitude was, ‘What’s Microsoft going to do for us?’” So they were asking an enormous price for licensing the fonts. And Microsoft didn’t want to license the fonts; it wanted to own the rights. (When Shaiman told me this, he laughed and proclaimed: “Microsoft doesn’t rent things!”)</p>

<p>Monotype, on the other hand, was much more receptive. Monotype was Linotype’s great rival; between them, the two companies had essentially created the business of mechanical typesetting in the late 19th century, with their competing hot-metal composition machines. But the Monotype Corporation had fallen on hard times. The typography division, the only part of the company working on digital fonts, was making money, but the larger machinery business was hemorrhaging cash, and the parent company was about to declare bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Out of that debacle rose a new type-only company, Monotype Typography Ltd, which was essentially the old typography division reconstituted as an independent business.</p>

<p>The new company, with its focus on digital fonts and information technology, was headed by a German, Rene Kerfante, who had joined Monotype in 1987 to head up the typography division, and an American, Ira Mirochnik, who had been Monotype’s chief financial officer. They were both quite ready to negotiate a deal with Microsoft.</p>

<p>So it was Monotype that began developing a set of “core fonts” for Microsoft: Scalable TrueType fonts that could be shipped with Windows and used freely by every Windows customer. The new fonts had to mimic the established core set of PostScript fonts, which included Times Roman and Helvetica. Since Monotype had originally developed the Times fonts back in the hot-metal days, that part was easy. To compete with Helvetica, though, they chose to adapt an earlier Monotype design with similar characteristics, called Arial.</p>

<p>Designing the outlines for these typefaces was the kind of task that the Monotype drawing office excelled at. The hard part was the hinting, the software instructions that control the rendering on various devices. That was what would make the fonts look good on screen.</p>

<p>Monotype had a team in the UK working on font hinting, but they were running into trouble. Although they had an auto-hinting program, called TypeMan, developed by Apple’s principal TrueType developer, Sampo Kaasila, the process was proving to be long, slow, and laborious. As Greg Hitchcock describes it, Monotype in desperation Monotype “sent out the bat signal.” In response, in September 1990, he and Eliyezer made the first of many trips to the UK to provide hands-on help and supervision. This was the start of a back-and-forth pattern for Greg—three weeks in the UK, one week in Redmond—that lasted for the next nine months. Their main job was hinting type, working in little rooms in archaic buildings at the old Monotype works. …</p></section></article></div>

Still can't bear the sticker shock of your very own Talos II, or even a itty bitty Blackbird? Why not do what we all do for the machines we can't own and emulate one instead? (And then decide you like it a lot, and save your pennies?)
</p><p>
QEMU 5.0.0 offers a machine model for the bare-metal PowerNV profile, to which the Raptor systems and other OpenPOWER POWER8 and POWER9 designs intended for Linux (i.e., not PowerVM machines) belong. Using the Talos II firmware image (mostly: one snag to be mentioned), you can boot the machine in QEMU and from there bring up an operating system in emulation. In this article we'll prove it works by bringing up <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power</a> (hi, Daniel!) in a variety of configurations. A set-up like this might be enough to test that your software or open-source package builds and runs on OpenPOWER, even if you don't own one yet. In a future article we'll talk about how you can boot your own code on the metal so you can port your favourite OS or build a unikernel.
</p><p>
(For the purposes of this article I'll assume an audience that isn't as familiar with OpenPOWER terminology as our usual readership. Kindly humour me.)
</p><p>
The emulation is imperfect, both if you're emulating it on a real Raptor family system or on an icky PC. While QEMU can emulate an AST2500 (i.e., the ARM-based Baseboard Management Controller, which acts as the service processor and provides the video framebuffer), and QEMU can also emulate a PowerNV system, it doesn't do both at the same time. That means the very lowest levels are actually being simulated here -- you can't watch Raptor's pretty Hostboot display, for example, and only the barest functions of the BMC are simulated enough to allow bring-up, not including the framebuffer. In fact, the hardware profiles we will use here do not in general match a real Raptor system either: we're just virtually plugging in PCI devices that give us necessary functionality, though of course none of the peripheral devices in a Raptor system is Raptor-proprietary. Finally, even though I have tagged this entry with KVM, KVM currently doesn't work right with the QEMU PowerNV machine model even though I'm pretty sure it should be technically possible. Sadly, I tried in vain to do so, could never get KVM-HV to be happy, and ended up kernel panicking the machine with KVM-PR. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/0b95d7bea3e9a270385a2360fbcf7f40">See if you can triumph where I have failed</a>. In the meantime, naturally you can do everything here on a T2 or Blackbird as well because that's how I did it writing this article, but there is no special acceleration for those systems right now.
</p><p>
The first order of business is the first order of business with any emulator: get the ROMs. Fortunately, no one is going to bust you for pirating a set of these because we're an open platform, remember?
</p><p>
The two pieces required are Skiboot and Petitboot, both of which live in the system's PNOR flash. <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">Skiboot</a> contains OPAL, the OpenPOWER Abstraction Layer. It comes in after the BMC has turned on main power and started the Power CPUs' self-boot engines, which then IPL ("initial program load") Hostboot for the second-stage power-on sequence. When Hostboot completes, it chains into Skiboot, which initializes the PCIe host bus controllers (PHBs) and provides all the basic hardware calls needed by a guest kernel to support the platform. You can think of it as something like an overgrown BIOS. This is the lowest firmware level of an OpenPOWER system that QEMU currently supports emulating.
</p><p>
Skiboot lives only to service a kernel, so it immediately starts one. This initial payload is the bootloader for <a href="https://github.com/open-power/petitboot">Petitboot</a>, which is also stored in firmware. Petitboot has a small Linux root (Skiroot) and acts as a boot menu, finding bootable volumes on attached devices or over the network. Having found one (or you select one), it chains into it to start the main OS, and from then on Skiboot will provide platform services via OPAL for this final guest until the system is shut down or restarted. Because it's in firmware, Petitboot is always available, which can come in really handy when you're trying to do system recovery.
</p><p>
The first, best and most dedicated way is to <a href="https://github.com/open-power/op-build">build Skiboot and Petitboot yourself</a>. They are open-source and the process is relatively well documented and automated, and you should know how to do this if you own an OpenPOWER machine anyhow. If you aren't doing this on a real OpenPOWER machine you'll need a cross-compiler, but most Linux distros offer such a package nowadays. Do keep in mind that if it looks like you're building a tiny Linux distro, well, that's because that's exactly what you're doing. The advantage here is you can fool around with the firmware at your leisure, but it requires a bit of an investment in disk space and time.
</p><p>
The second way assumes you have a more casual interest and would prefer to go with something prefab. It's possible if you (or, you know, your "friend") has a Raptor-family system to extract the necessary components right from the BMC prompt. Log into the BMC over SSH (or via <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2020/04/what-to-do-when-bmc-wont-talk-to-you.html">direct serial connection</a>) and type <tt>pflash -i</tt>. You'll see a list of all the partitions stored in the PNOR flash. The ones we want are <tt>PAYLOAD</tt> (which contains Skiboot) and <tt>BOOTKERNEL</tt> (which contains Skiroot and Petitboot). The exact addresses may vary from system to system and firmware to firmware.
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# pflash -P PAYLOAD -r /tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD" from 0x021a1000..0x022a1000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%<br>
root@bmc:~# pflash -P BOOTKERNEL -r /tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL" from 0x022a1000..0x03821000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%
</tt></p><p>
We skip the first 4K page to avoid the wrapping around each partition. <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> is actually compressed and needs to be uncompressed prior to use, so:
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# cd /tmp<br>
root@bmc:/tmp# xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Finally, <tt>scp</tt> both <tt>skiboot.lid</tt> and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> to your desired system from the BMC.
</p><p>
Admittedly we just talked at length about the two ways most of you <em>won't</em> get the firmware, so let's talk about the third method and the way most of you will, i.e., you'll just download it. Currently there is an irregularity about Raptor's present Skiboot build for this purpose: it only boots if you are emulating a single <em>POWER8</em>. That's not a typo. If you use it to boot an emulated POWER9, the guest will simply panic, and the guest will go into a bootloop if you are emulating multiple POWER8 CPUs (necessary if you need a larger number of PCIe devices). This is undoubtedly a QEMU deficiency which will be corrected in future releases. In the meantime, if you just care about playing around using a single POWER8 on a terminal, then Raptor's builds (either from BMC flash or downloaded) will suffice. However, if you intend to emulate a POWER9 or SMP POWER8 system, <a href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/pc-bios/skiboot.lid">download QEMU's own pre-built <tt>skiboot.lid</tt></a> and use that instead.
</p><p>
For Petitboot, we will extract that directly from Raptor's PNOR images. Assuming you didn't get it using the process above, <a href="https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Talos_II/Firmware">download the current Talos II PNOR image</a> and decompress it. In the <tt>shell_upgrade</tt> directory you will see the <tt>bzip2</tt>-compressed PNOR image. Uncompress that, leaving you with a filename like <tt>talos-ii-v2.00.pnor</tt>. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/4a2c907d0acec5b537cd4992a00801c3">Download my <tt>pnorex</tt> extractor tool</a> (it's in Perl, because I'm one of <em>those</em> people) and run it on the PNOR image:
</p><p>
<tt>% pnorex talos-ii-v2.00.pnor<br>
Version 1 PNOR archive with 33 entries.<br>
Extracting PAYLOAD at offset 8601.<br>
This is a xz format image.<br>
Wrote 1020K successfully.<br>
Extracting BOOTKERNEL at offset 8857.<br>
This is an ELF executable image.<br>
Wrote 22012K successfully.<br>
Extracted 2 partitions successfully.
</tt>
</p><p>
If you will be using Raptor's Skiroot, then uncompress <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> to <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> as above: <tt>xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Now, with <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> (for this first example, either Raptor's or QEMU's) and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> in the same folder, grab an ISO you want to boot. I used the prefab one Daniel offers on the <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power site</a> since I know it boots fine on OpenPOWER hardware. For our first example let's do a simple example of booting Void from a CD image on a POWER8 using the serial port. Our QEMU command line:
</p><p>
<tt>
qemu-system-ppc64 -M powernv8 -m 4G -cpu power8 \<br>
        -nographic \<br>
        -bios ./skiboot.lid \<br>
        -kernel ./pnor.BOOTKERNEL \<br>
        -device ich9-ahci,id=ahci0 \<br>
        -drive id=cd0,media=cdrom,file=void-live-ppc64le-musl-20200411.iso,if=none \<br>
        -device ide-cd,bus=ahci0.0,drive=cd0
</tt>
</p><p>
This configures a single-processor POWER8 system with 4GB of RAM, no graphics, and an Intel AHCI host controller with a single CD-ROM drive attached. The serial output should go to your terminal. It goes a little like this:
</p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3VII_RkIwcE/XvFb7tRycOI/AAAAAAAABs0/yyvLDu_1liEFaU2wpoZWtrf-au1P1YiDACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-44-48.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3VII_RkIwcE/XvFb7tRycOI/AAAAAAAABs0/yyvLDu_1liEFaU2wpoZWtrf-au1P1YiDACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-44-48.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
Here we are with Skiboot chaining into Petitboot. You can ignore the errors; there will be a lot of them since the platform is still incomplete. It will take a little bit of time to decompress the kernel (much slower than it would be on a regular system). You will notice a single device attached to the three available PCIe host bridges on the single POWER8 CPU, i.e., the host controller itself. Don't you just love that the vendor code for Intel is <tt>8086</tt>?
</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3IKOOE6kD80/XvFb7uxi8sI/AAAAAAAABss/yKU2WHvBCbgDmXPvyFdSvsCu7yLHnnGuACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-08.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3IKOOE6kD80/XvFb7uxi8sI/AAAAAAAABss/yKU2WHvBCbgDmXPvyFdSvsCu7yLHnnGuACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-08.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
This is Petitboot. When the bootable choices appear, cursor up to the starred option and press E before it autoboots, because we need to tell Void its console is the on-board serial port (otherwise it uses a VGA console: not sure whose bug that is).
</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dDE00hPAsk/XvFb7k5ug4I/AAAAAAAABsw/KD1kofJkAdIusk9rtl8WyjlknApxQRouQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-43.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dDE00hPAsk/XvFb7k5ug4I/AAAAAAAABsw/KD1kofJkAdIusk9rtl8WyjlknApxQRouQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-43.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
Add <tt>console=hvc0</tt> at the end, cursor down to <tt>OK</tt> and hit RETURN/ENTER a couple times to boot.
</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h6UHepGrXLo/XvFb8GHW5jI/AAAAAAAABs4/STBtGNaljU4-3EvsmhlstoBbIpU0aLaKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-47-38.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h6UHepGrXLo/XvFb8GHW5jI/AAAAAAAABs4/STBtGNaljU4-3EvsmhlstoBbIpU0aLaKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-47-38.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
A successful login on your emulated baby POWER8. Ta-daa! To rudely pull the plug on the QEMU session, press Ctrl-A, and then X (<tt>QEMU: Terminated</tt>).
</p><p>
Let's now load out the POWER8. We would like to add a video card, an Ethernet card and a USB controller to our existing system, but POWER8 Turismo chips only offer enough PHBs for three PCI endpoints. How do we solve this problem? Easy: we'll add another processor!
