              <p>Hi from the team who built the "mesonet" weather station networks in the state of South Australia!</p>
              <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonet">mesonet</a> is a term for a network of automated weather stations designed to monitor meteorological phenomena at high geographic density and updated frequently.</p>
              <p>We built these networks to help prevent pesticide <a href="#spraydrift">spray drift</a> - the phenomenon in which pesticide spray that is applied to a crop ends up drifting to other crops, sometimes many kilometres away.</p>
              <p>Spray drift can be a huge problem, as it can lead to damage or even destruction of highly valuable crops, and can also cause pollution to waterways and harm to native ecosystems.</p>
              <p>The biggest factor in spray drift the presence of a <a href="#thermalinversions">thermal inversion</a>, a state in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, which usually happens in the evening and overnight when the earth is cooling, but can happen at other times. However other meteorological phenomena also affect the likelihood of spray drift, and different types of spray respond differently.</p>
              <p>So we designed a <a href="#ourweatherstations">weather station</a> to measure all the relevant meteorological phenomena, and in particular to detect thermal inversions, and a custom <a href="#webapp">web app</a> to display the data in format that is very fast and simple to access and understand.</p>
              <p>We've now deployed 70 of these stations across two of the major agricultural regions of South Australia, and so far it seems to be making a difference: no damage due to spray drift has been reported in these regions since the networks were rolled out.</p>


              

              <a name="background"><h2>Background</h2></a>

              <p>A group of stakeholders in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North">Mid North region of South Australia</a> had identified spray drift as a major issue.</p>
              <p>The region, to the north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia">South Australia</a>'s capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, has a thriving agricultural sector, producing wheat, barley, wine grapes, pulses, livestock and other produce.</p>
              <p>The total annual output from the region is valued at nearly AUD $2 billion. It has been estimated that the potential loss in production from spray drift could be as high as $178M/year, and potential harm to waterways and native ecosystems is significant.</p>
              <p>The local stakeholders worked with meteorologists and researchers to develop a solution, then sought funding from the South Australia state government to fund the project.</p>
              <p>In 2018, a $1.4M grant was provided, and a pilot rollout of 40 weather stations was undertaken.  It was named the Mid North Mesonet.</p>
              <p>The pilot was deemed successful, and in 2019, another grant was provided by the state government for a network in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverland">Riverland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Mallee">Mallee</a> region to the north-east of Adelaide.</p>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was rolled out, there have been no reported instances of crop damage due spray drift.</p>

              <a name="spraydrift"><h2>The Problem of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>Farmers spray pesticides on their crops to manage pests. It is an important feature of modern farming. Herbicide may be applied to target broad-leaf plants, other times to target summer weeds.</p>
              <p>Spray drift occurs when pesticide spray 'drifts' across into non-target areas.</p>
              <p>Spray drift is a problem because:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The affected non-target area may be particularly susceptible to pesticides (i.e. broad-leaf crops such as grapevines are especially vulnerable)</li>
                    <li>Some markets are highly sensitive to the amount of pesticide residues detectable in the end products (i.e. wine exports to China; organic farms; etc)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might be a sensitive natural ecosystem (i.e. local waterways)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might include rain water tanks used for drinking water</li>
                    <li>It is a waste of pesticide product and labour time costs</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <a name="causesofspraydrift"><h2>Causes of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>A combination of conditions can lead to spray drift.</p>
              <h3>Wind Speed</h3>
              <p>Wind speed that is very low or very high.</p>
              <h3>Temperature</h3>
              <p>A temperature over about 28°C (83°F).</p>
              <h3>Humidity</h3>
              <p>The effect of humidity varies depending on the type of spray. The spray manufacturer's instructions should provide guidance.</p>
              <h3>Atmospheric Stability</h3>
              <p><i>Unstable</i> or <i>stable</i> conditions can lead to spray drift. Conditions should be <i>neutral.</i></p>
              <h3>Thermal Inversions</h3>
              <p>A thermal inversion, in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, is a major risk factor for spray drift.</p>
              <p>Inversions generally happen in the evening and overnight as the earth cools, but they can happen at other times.</p>

              <a name="thermalinversions"><h2>Thermal Inversions</h2></a>
              <p>For current farming practices, long-distance spray drift generally occurs during very stable weather conditions (i.e. little to no air turbulence).</p>
              <p>A thermal inversion occurs when a warm layer of air sits above a cooler layer of air near the ground.</p>
              <p>This reduces air turbulence and can act as a ‘lid’ for an airborne pollutant source. The lack of air turbulence means the smaller spray droplets float without settling on the target crops.</p>
              <p>A very slight breeze can then carry these floating droplets large distances before they eventually descend into a non-target area.</p>
              <p>It is illegal to spray during a thermal inversion.</p>

              <p><strong>The problem: it is very difficult for farmers to tell if a thermal inversion is underway.</strong></p>

                    <li>Measure temperature at 1.2m and 10m, in order to detect inversions</li>
                    <li>Measure all weather metrics that are relevant in determining whether it is safe to spray</li>

              <a name="webapp"><h2>The Web Application</h2></a>

              <p>We initially used an off-the-shelf web application for displaying meteorological data, but soon realised we needed something tailored to our needs. We found a company that was already in the business of building web-applications to display environmental data for farmers, and they were willing to build a customised version for us.</p>

              <p>The key requirements for the application were:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of the monitored metrics displayed on a map, with fast/simple switching between each metric</li>
                    <li>A dashboard of all the current key metrics and recent historical graphs</li>
                    <li>Long-term graphs of all the key metrics also available, and as well as the past 48 hours of data in tabular format</li>
                    <li>The site must display well and be easy to use on a mobile device, and be fast to use even in areas with low cellular signal strength, given that much of the usage will be by farmers out in the field in remote areas.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>The key technologies are:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Redis</li>
                    <li>Sidekiq for queue processing</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>Data is uploaded from the data logger via FTP (which may seem primitive, but the world of meteorological data still relies heavily on FTP).</p>

              <p>On detection of new data, the application first takes the most recent readings, and updates the data structures for the map and dashboard views.</p>

              <p>The historical data is then placed in a queue, for updating of historical graphs.</p>

              <p>All the data for the map view, dashboards and historical graphs are formatted into a JSON hash then serialized and stored in the Redis cache. That way, when the React web interface makes a request, the pre-formatted data can be retrieved and sent very quickly, as no querying, processing or formatting of data is required at request time.</p>

              <a name="results"><h2>Results so far</h2></a>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was deployed, there have been no reported cases of crop damage due to spray drift.</p>

              <p>Damage and loss had been reported in most of the previous years - though not all. So it is too early to tell if the problem has been completely solved, but indications are promising.</p>

              <p>Other government bodies and NGOs are expressing interest in establishing their own mesonets.</p>

<p><em>Update: There’s a <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/is-domain-driven-design-overrated/">slightly extended version of this post</a> over at the INNOQ company blog.</em></p>
<p>There, I said it. Now that I have your attention: Domain Driven Design (DDD) has recently gained additional popularity, as evidenced by new books, conference talks (and even complete conferences dedicated to it), and lots of trainings – including some by our very own colleagues at <a href="https://www.innoq.com/">INNOQ</a>. And in contrast to my click-bait headline, I’m actually a fan. <a href="https://www.dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">Eric Evans’s book</a>, the additional work writing and evangelizing it done by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.com/">Vaughn Vernon</a> (e.g. in <a href="https://www.case-podcast.org/15-domain-driven-design-with-vaughn-vernon">this very good podcast</a> with my colleague Joy) and many others, are all very good additions to our industry’s body of knowledge. In the best sense of pattern languages, DDD gives clear names to things that many developers and designers know how to do, but cannot reliably and compatibly communicate about.</p>
<p>But I’m annoyed by the fact that recently, it seems that any time somebody talks about how to architect system or service boundaries, or even just mentions non-technical design, everybody feels compelled to bring in the DDD experts – as if they were the only superheroes who could possibly design anything at all. This is just as bad as any other situation where you blindly apply the solution that’s currently en vogue, just because it is the thing everyone talks about, and not because it is the right solution for the job. DDD is great, but it’s just one of many tools and techniques you should be aware of.</p>
<p>I think there is a more important aspect that people miss, especially when they get into DDD as their introduction to design in general. DDD emphasizes the importance of naming, and it suggests you should strive for a common, ubiquitous language, in the context you’re designing for. But it also uses its own language – concepts like bounded context, aggregates, entities, value objects, etc. – for our domain, the domain of designing systems. And while these are all well and good, they’re only one possible language. There’s value in calling a value object a value object, if this is a term many people understand, to facilitate communication. But the existing, common DDD concepts are not the only concepts you should consider – they are just examples of a very common trait of designing and architecting systems: Coming up with and recognizing patterns, giving them good names, and using them to give the system structure and integrity. If in your architecture, there’s a common pattern that you use a Filter to route requests to a Handler, or a concept of a Document that is handled by an Agent, then these things may occur again and again, on the same level as Services or Repositories, and end up being way more important to you. This is fine! This concept, that we can and should invent our own languages, is to me way more important than many naïve DDD practitioners think. I like to believe that DDD experts know this very well, and view any DDD material as a starting point, not an end result – but if all you’re doing is applying the by-the-book definition of existing DDD terms, and trying to shoe-horn any problem into this existing structure, yours is a very sad designer’s life.</p>
<p>There is a life beyond DDD. Not every good design needs to be Domain-Driven (though I can accept it should always be driven by the domain, just not necessarily in the DDD sense). You can design good systems even if you’re not a DDD expert.</p>

<p>Do you remember your first time using a modern smartphone? A vibrant screen that responded instantly when you tapped replaced cramped keyboards. You could sign your name, drag and drop apps around the screen, and even spin the giant Price is Right wheel to set your alarm. In 2007, this felt like a the future. There's a reason it was called 'the Jesus phone.'</p>
<p>At that same time, The Motorola Razr (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_IK295sfxQ">video</a>) was the top phone on the market. It was a flip phone with the ability to take photos, play videos, browse the web, and play music. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Phones in 2007 had the same features as the iPhone. The Palm Treo (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK7FvGz4Jkc">video</a>) even had a touch screen.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/smartphones-2007.png">
<p>The difference was <em>speed</em>.</p>
<p>When you touched a Razr or a Palm phone, there was a delay. It felt sluggish and slow. Apple removed the delay between your finger tapping the screen and something happening. Your finger could finally manipulate the UI in realtime, just like in the real world. It felt magical. If there was even a slight delay, the whole experience fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Speed is a killer feature. Speed is a differentiator.</strong></p>
<p>Yet teams consistently overlook speed. Instead, they add more features (which ironically make things slower). Products bloat over time and performance goes downhill.</p>
<p>New features might help your users accomplish something extra in your product.
<strong>Latency stops your users from doing the job they already hire your product for.</strong></p>
<p>Slow ui acts like tiny papercuts. Every time we have to wait, we get impatient, frustrated, and lose our flow.</p>
<h2>Honestly assess your speed</h2>
<p>I want you to take a moment and approach your product with a fresh set of eyes: Eyes for speed  👀</p>
<p>Go through your onboarding flow and try your core product features. Take mental note of how long each step takes to appear on the page then to be interactive.</p>
<p>How slow is it?
Be honest.
It’s ok, I’ve been there too.</p>
<p>Does your checkout page take 10+ seconds to load? Did you have to wait for a loading indicator multiple times along the way? Did things look interactive but weren’t loaded yet?</p>
<p>Every one of these is an opportunity. The great thing about speed (also called ‘performance’) is that you can stack rank it and burn it down.</p>
<p>Imagine what your product would feel like if everything happened in real time.</p>
<p><img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/speed-keanu-sandra.png"></p><p>Be like Keanu and fix every slowdown in your product. Your users will thank you.</p>
<h2>Places where speed matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speed during Checkout - Every second of page load time kills conversion rates. A 1 second delay <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/">reduces conversion rate by 7%</a>.</li>
<li>Framerate in Virtual Reality - The early days of Virtual Reality caused intense nausea akin to motion sickness <a href="https://link.medium.com/QyheLe9rbeb">when framerates dropped below 60fps</a>.</li>
<li>Design Tools - Users are consistently frustrated when Sketch or Figma are slow. <a href="https://quizlet.com/blog/everything-i-know-about-design">Designers have high APM</a> (actions per minute) and a small slowdown can occur 5-10 times per minute.</li>
<li>The core interaction of your product - Your product exists to save people time or help them solve a problem. Introducing friction or delay during the most important flow of your product will drive people crazy. Notion has developed a reputation for being a sluggish product:</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/reddit-notion.png">
<h2>Perception vs. Reality</h2>
<p>If you can’t speed up a specific action, you can often fake it. Perceived speed is just as important as actual speed. Even if you can’t be fast, you should appear to be fast.</p>
<p><strong>Large content</strong> - Render the screen while content loads so the user knows what’s coming.
<strong>Long load times</strong> - Make the screen interactive, even if everything hasn’t loaded.
<strong>Waiting for an action</strong> - Allow the user to take the action and keep moving but post the action in the background.
<strong>Very long actions</strong> - If you have an action that will take 30s or more, offer to notify the user (e.g. via email) when the action is available.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of products that fake being fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook’s app pioneered loading images that look like actual content. The structure and UI of the page loads but the content does not. As a result, you can still use the product and prepare to take actions, even if the content hasn’t loaded.</li>
<li>Games have a rule to never block the input thread. You can slow down the visuals but the controls should always feel responsive so the user feels in control.</li>
<li>Robinhood has you swipe up to trade, but runs your transaction in the background and notifies you via email when your trade is complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When is it ok to be slow?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When there is a physical constraint that causes things to take a while (e.g. dispensing money from an ATM)</li>
<li>When you want to give people a chance to correct a mistake (e.g. Gmail's "undo" feature)</li>
<li>When a human has to keep up with a machine (e.g. we slow down video game framerates, otherwise the game would run at 60x speed and overwhelm you).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Fun: What would it be like to live with lag?</h2>
<p>Imagine making breakfast with a 1 second latency added to every action you take. Even something as simple as moving your hands so that an egg rests over a bowl becomes incredibly challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a real life experiment where 0.5-3s of latency was added to everyone's action via a VR headset:</strong></p>

<p>This is what we're forcing on people when we ship laggy software. We're making them spend their time waiting for us.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
      
      <div><p>We’ve launched a brand new version of Element, called <a href="https://element.io/element-home">Element Home</a>!<br></p><p>It’s the Element app, but faster, personalised and under your control - all packaged up so you don’t have to worry about how it works! You can just enjoy the fact you know you chose someone you trust (us!) with your data.<br></p><p>So that you know, here’s what’s going on behind the scenes with Element Home; in practice you’re getting your own fully managed, dedicated server alongside your Element app. It means you have a notably faster service than when using a typical free public server - you’re saved the hassle of self-hosting and it’s guaranteed to be kept updated with the very latest and greatest Matrix hosting best practices.<br></p><div><p>On top of faster messaging, Element Home comes with five user accounts. It’s the ideal way for a family, or groups of friends, to get a super-quick professionally hosted version of Element.</p><p><strong>A new type of messenger</strong></p></div><p>As you know, Element is completely different to most messaging apps. <br></p><p>Because Element is <strong>decentralised</strong>, the app itself (what you see) is separate from the Matrix hosting service behind it (what you don’t see; the movement of messages and where they are stored).<br></p><p>That’s important because it lets users decide where their messages and data are kept. In owning that choice, you also get to own your data and messages rather than having them sucked up into the likes of Facebook Messenger, Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp.<br></p><p>Some people choose to host themselves, and that’s great. As it requires some technical knowledge, many others choose to use a free public hosting service such as Matrix.org to get up and running.<br></p><p>Element Home is a third option; the ability to pay for a fully managed, dedicated server (aka a ‘homeserver’). Being a dedicated server, it devotes itself to just a handful of users; and that’s why it’s so much quicker than a typical free public server that constantly juggles thousands of users.</p><p><strong>There are many messaging apps, but surprisingly little choice.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 2108w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Element compared with centralised messaging apps.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Free vs $10 per month</strong><br></p><p>As you know, Element and Matrix is all about giving you choice. If you want to use the free version, that’s completely fine by us!<br></p><p>But here’s the extra you get in return for a few bucks a month:<br></p><ol><li>Element Home means you’re <strong>hosted by Element Matrix Services</strong> - our Matrix-based hosting platform used by big companies and public sector organisations. You have a <strong>dedicated server</strong> (so you’re sharing minimal infrastructure with anyone else), fully managed and maintained by the most Matrix-savvy team in the world.<br></li><li>Professional-hosting means the service is <strong>notably faster</strong> than when hosted by a typical free public server, and <strong>always fully updated</strong> and maintained.<br></li><li>An Element domain that you can name, so you can make <strong>memorable Matrix IDs</strong> such as @yourfirstname:yoursurname.ems.host. Use your surname as the domain, and it’s perfect for family sharing!<br></li><li><strong>Five Element accounts</strong> - so after using one yourself, you’ll have four more for family or friends - so that’s <strong>just $2 per user per month</strong> for a super-quick data sovereign messaging service (you can add more users if you wish).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Matching IDs for all the family!</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wishing you could turn back time?!</strong></p><p>If you’re an Element user and you’re self-hosting, or using a typical free public server (such as Matrix.org), you can simply copy your existing account over to Element Home. Currently, you can only do this in the Element web app (we’re working on an equally simple upgrade from within Android and iOS). Once you’ve upgraded your ‘old’ account will still be live, so feel free to keep it or delete it as you see fit.<br></p><p>For those not already up and running on Element, just <a href="https://element.io/element-home">sign up for Element Home</a> from here.</p></div>

<![CDATA[How to Read Assembly Language]]>

March 1, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location
(like the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a>
statement), or calling or returning from a function. (The x86
architecture has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">lots of not-so-small
instructions</a>
as well. Some of these are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5959890/enter-vs-push-ebp-mov-ebp-esp-sub-esp-imm-and-leave-vs-mov-esp-ebp">legacy
cruft</a>
built up over the 40-odd years of the architecture’s existence, and
others are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">newfangled
additions</a>. )</p><p>Our first toy example will get us acquainted with simple
instructions. It just calculates the square of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">norm</a>
of a 2D vector:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and here is the resulting x86_64 assembly from clang 11, <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tQVvQAZPLUwA5YwCNMxEADZSAB1QLC62nsMTQS8fNTorG3sjJxd3JRUw2gYCZmICAONTTkVlTFU/ZNSCCLtHZzdFFLSMoOyFKuLrUujy1wBKRVQDYmQOAHIpAGZrZEMsAGpxQZ1kevx6KexxAAYAQRXV%2BuIDVXGANTzJSYB2WTXxi/HrAlduAH0CcYAPKbPVy6v6W4fxgE9XjbiY4AEQBaw212%2Bj1oJCMDAAjgZUph0BADsgjgA3NonN4fYiYAjdWjjTEAOie4wAVKSKZMZLTftTGWD1iC%2Bh1WCA%2BgBWPqkUx9Zb81DcnRyOTjBRdHqYemDTj8gjc4VtDoAaxAg0GZO1ev1BvcXL63H5guFpFFfX5ChAy1IyqFHNIcFgSDQRg8eHYZAoEA9Xp9KGEok4nGW2So3oIzltEAcKv5DmsqV%2B3MVpA9Ri0BAA8rRWGmnaQsEYRMB2ImS3gCflMZhbcXME88gYY%2Bn%2BddlB2hHgHMRU3osD2CMQ8EYOx0aPQmGwODx%2BIIQ2IJTJew5bZAOqgPIlGwBaXODcb7uZTYESGRySQW%2BJ5RKabQ1LKkcwlKIxYLeXx0Z9f0J%2BO%2BZQuHUuT5HQhTVPomSCHe4FJA0QEtCBlRFH%2BdSIU0H7lJwHTSt0vRcJy3J8gKVZWk8AAcrj7rc4yjOW4xhmSyxkpw4wQLghAkPK2TjHonres4vE4uKV4yEqiZqqQmrarqBoKdqRrcqaZHFlaNp2g6UkujAiAoKggk%2BuQlABkJLgMaG4aRtGsaUAmxbJrQqY9lmOb5oWValuWlbFvgtZqPWjYWs2rbtn0GZdsaFqsH2A7EL8Q79Bao7jpOpDTowLCVguAiSEI5YoKu8ixRu8DbrufgHkeJ5noMF7FTeNpgQ%2BEDmOhr7aEhn7ZCEP7%2BNBtSeN%2BiTdThOQJAUDQdXBiSQY0kTAbB02DS%2B9RFGNIF4TKhG4UIJFmuR3JUTRdGWcATGcCxbEcVxRDELxpD8YZgbCUMkiicVklOtJsk6opin7Sah3qdymn2o6qrEX0kggxaGnaT9HT1sQPgaNwQA%3D%3D">via Compiler Explorer</a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>imulq</span>   %rdi, %rdi
        <span>imulq</span>   %rsi, %rsi
        <span>leaq</span>    (%rsi,%rdi), %rax
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
<span>    <span>void</span> <span>debugPrint</span>() <span>const</span>;
</span>};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
<span>    v.debugPrint();

some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function

smallish strings.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We might write something like

</span></code></pre></div><p>Our function prologue has gotten a lot longer, and we have some new
control flow instructions as well. Let’s take a closer look at the
prologue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>pushq</span>   %rbp
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbp
        <span>pushq</span>   %r15
        <span>pushq</span>   %r14
        <span>pushq</span>   %rbx
        <span>pushq</span>   %rax
        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Finally, we save our first argument (<code>%rdi</code>) in <code>%r14</code>.</p><p>On to the function body. We call <code>strlen(s)</code> with <code>callq strlen</code> and
store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch
to <code>.LBB0_2</code> was not taken. We have a blob of instructions to create
<code>char temp[sSize + 1]</code> on the stack:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %r15
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbx
        <span>addq</span>    <span>$15</span>, %rdi
        <span>andq</span>    <span>$-16</span>, %rdi
        <span>subq</span>    %rdi, %rbx
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rsp
</code></pre></div><p>We save <code>%rsp</code> to <code>%r15</code> and <code>%rbx</code> for later
use.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Then, we add 15 to <code>%rdi</code> (which,
remember, contains the size of our array), mask off the lower 4 bits
with <code>andq $-16, %rdi</code>, and subtract the result from <code>%rbx</code>, which we
then put back into <code>%rsp</code>. In short, this rounds the array size up to
the next multiple of 16 bytes and makes space for it on the stack.</p><p>The following block simply calls <code>copyUppercase</code> and <code>puts</code> as written in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>movq</span>    %r14, %rsi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>copyUppercase</span>(<span>char</span>*, <span>char</span> <span>const</span>*)
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>puts</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we have our function epilogue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %r15, %rsp
        <span>leaq</span>    -<span>24</span>(%rbp), %rsp
        <span>popq</span>    %rbx
        <span>popq</span>    %r14
        <span>popq</span>    %r15
        <span>popq</span>    %rbp
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We restore the stack pointer to deallocate our variable-length array
using <code>leaq</code>. Then, we <code>popq</code> the registers we saved during the
function prologue and return control to our caller, and we are done.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the path when <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code> and we branch to
<code>.LBB0_2</code>. This path is more …</p></div></div></div>

            <h2>What is Literate Programming?</h2>
            <p>Literate programming is a style of programming invented by Donald Knuth, where the main idea is
            that a program's source code is made primarily to be read and understood by other people, and
            secondarily to be executed by the computer.</p>
            
            <p>This frees the programmer from the structure of a program imposed by the computer and means that
            the programmer can develop programs in the order of the flow of their thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>A Literate program consists of explanation of the code in a natural language such as English, interspersed
            with snippets of code to be executed. This means that Literate programs are very easy to understand and share,
            as all the code is well explained.</p>
            
            <p>Literate, a tool for literate programming, will allow you to take a literate source file (<code>*.lit</code>) and
            either <em>tangle</em> the source file which will create a file with executable code, or <em>weave</em> the
            source file, which will generate an HTML document to be read as formatted documentation.</p>

            <!-- What are the features of lit -->
            <h2>Features of this tool</h2><p>
            Literate works with any programming language, generates HTML as output (<a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/">which can be converted to pdf</a>),
            and generates readable code. The code that is generated is indented properly and is automatically commented using the titles you have written
            for the code blocks.</p><p>
            Here is the full list of features:</p><ul>
                <li>Supports any language including syntax highlighting and pretty printing in HTML</li>
                <li>Generates HTML as output</li>
                <li>Generates readable code and commented in the target language</li>
                <li>Reports syntax errors back from the compiler to the right line in the literate source</li>
                <li>Runs fast -- wc.lit compiled for me in 7ms for both code and html output</li>
                <li>Markdown based -- very easy to read and write Literate source.</li>
                <li>Automatically generates hyperlinks between code sections</li>
                <li>Formatted output similar to CWEB</li>
                <li>Creates an index with identifiers used (you need to have exuberant or universal ctags installed to use this feature)</li>
                <li>Supports TeX equations with <code>$</code> notation</li>
                <li>Compatible with Vim (<a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/literate.vim" target="_blank">literate.vim</a>)</li>
                <li>Highly customizable</li>
            </ul><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. government has asked Google to fork over granular data on how its search engine works and is monetized, seeking to prove that the internet giant is a monopoly.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are seeking comparable data on U.S. search results and related ad from Feb. 2, 2015 to Feb. 8, 2015 and from Feb. 3, 2020 to Feb. 9, 2020, according to a legal filing Monday.</p>

<p>The Alphabet Inc. unit is being asked to share data on how and where users searched in those periods, the quantity of different types of ads, revenue from those ads and what the underlying bids were for them, among other details. The government told the company it wants the information within 30 days.</p>

<p>The Justice Department under former U.S. President Donald Trump and 11 Republican attorneys general originally filed the suit. Three other states have since joined, including California, the site of Googleâ€™s headquarters. The latest data request shows the government is pressing ahead under a new administration led by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The U.S. government alleges Googleâ€™s exclusive deals to distribute its search engine on browsers and phones, including Apple Inc.â€™s iPhones, violates the Sherman Actâ€™s prohibition on monopolization. Itâ€™s the most significant U.S. monopoly case since the one against Microsoft Corp. more than 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Google has said its deals donâ€™t prevent consumers from switching to other search providers. The company argues its success rests on superior technology.</p>

<p>In this post, I will focus on <strong>gradients of image signals defined on grids</strong> in computer graphics and image processing. Specifically, gradients / derivatives of images, height fields, distance fields, when they are represented as discrete, uniform grids of pixels or voxels.</p>



<p>I’ll start with the very basics – what do we typically mean by gradients (as it’s not always “standardized”), what are they used for, what are the ypical methods (forward or central differences), their cons and problems, and then proceed to discuss an interesting alternative with very nice properties – <strong>diagonal gradients</strong>.</p>



<p>My post will conclude with advice on how to use them in practice in a simple useful scheme, how to extend it with a little bit of computations to a super useful concept of a <strong>structure tensor</strong> that can characterize dominating direction of any gradient field, and finish with some signal processing fun – <strong>frequency domain analysis </strong>of forward and central differences.</p>



<h2>Image gradients</h2>



<p>What are image gradients or derivatives? How do you define gradients on a grid?</p>



<p>It’s not very well defined problem on discrete signals, but the most common and useful way to think about it is inspired by signal processing and the idea of sampling:</p>



<p><strong>Assuming there was some continuous signal that got discretized, what would be the partial derivative with regards to the spatial dimension of this continuous signal at gradient evaluation points?</strong></p>



<p>This interpretation is useful both for computer graphics (where we might have discretized descriptions of continuous surfaces; like voxel fields, heightmaps, or distance fields), as well as in image processing (where we often assume that images are “natural images” that got photographed).</p>



<p>Continuous gradients and derivatives used for things like normals of procedural SDFs are also interesting, but a different story. I will not cover those here, and instead recommend you check out <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/normalsSDF/normalsSDF.htm">this cool post</a> by Inigo Quilez with lots of practical tricks (re-reading it I learned about the tetrahedron trick) and advice. I am sure that no matter your level of familiarity with the topic, you will learn something new.</p>



<p>In my post, I will focus on computer graphics, image processing, and basic signal processing takes on the problem. There are two much deeper connections that I haven’t personally worked too much with. So I leave it as something that I wish I can expand my knowledge in the future, but also encourage my readers to explore it:</p>



<p><strong>Further reading one:</strong> The first connection is with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation">Partial Differential Equations</a> and their discretization. Solving PDEs and solving discretized PDEs is something that many specialized scientific domains deal with, and computing gradients is an inherent part of numerical discretized PDE solutions. I don’t know too much about those, but I’m sure literature covers this in much detail.</p>



<p><strong>Further reading two:</strong> The second connection is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet">wavelets</a>, filter banks, and the frequency precision / localization trade-off. This is something used in communication theory, electrical engineering, radar systems, audio systems, and many more. While I read and am familiar with <em>some </em>theory, I haven’t found too many practical uses of wavelets (other than the simplest Gabor ones or in use for image pyramids) in my work, so again I’ll just recommend you some more specialized reading.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Applications</h2>



<p>Ok, why would we want to compute gradients? Two common uses:</p>



<p><strong>Compute surface normals </strong>– when we have something like a scalar field – whether distance field describing an underlying implicit surface, or simply a height field, we might want to compute its gradients to compute normals of the surface, or of the heightfield for normal mapping, evaluating BRDFs and lighting etc. Maybe even for physical simulation, collision, or animation on terrain!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/u5cS-rFvdRrpN6iFTGYqDYyF8wMLCtB5-5ir2gQVMaQo8DmURyVdqF8Fyedcx9VW5boiVP8QuQZkL8zAEqG8_TYrkqx6b0bkWajLS-8IJykhlmhtxTH_YEXw_xivXSbd_2rPVLcX" alt=""><figcaption><strong>Left: </strong>an example heightmap image, <strong>right:</strong> partial derivatives (exaggerated for demonstration) that can be used for generating normal maps for lighting, collision, and many other uses in a 3D environment.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Find edges, discontinuities, corners, and image features</strong> – the other application that I will focus much more on is simply finding image features like edges, corners, regions of “detail” or texture; areas where signal changes and becomes more “interesting”. The human visual system is actually built from many <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1350218/">edge detectors and local differentiators</a> and can be thought of as a <strong>multi-scale spatiotemporal gradient analyzer</strong>! This is biologically motivated – when signal changes in space or time, it means it’s a potential point of interest or a threat.</p>



<p>The bonus use-case of just computing the gradients is finding the orientation and description of those features. This is bread and butter of any image processing, but also very common in computer graphics – from morphological anti-aliasing, selectively super-sampling only edges, or special effects. I will go back to it in the description of local features in the <strong>Structure Tensor</strong> section, but for now let’s use the most common application – just using the gradient vector magnitude, used for example in the <strong>Sobel operator</strong>: <img width="131" height="55" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XNZ1Arqp0sBJFnwkaJY9qxwOnn75NM57llXbo-aLmwwwPLxv93Sr8qWfaOswcKcWnvc1Hy-HGWKrsW9KHj10G-UkqOICr3SYO_Q6cXWvYBIZu5EALhRiSfp-mqrHpg6rjRFXJpAP">.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B3C3hX34jil9a3GVJJY8e051jxZV-K2v2k0UqMIi9MkajBeYnB8LhKFLMlhRph-8Oe8-R5WyPzWyA9W6X6FISmSwvJ4hPf_adGwpA1Niwpn4qCNkLKYVUTk3ZK5rdLb1guiQu5rN" alt=""><figcaption>Gradient magnitude can be used for simple edge detection in an image, but also many more (described later in the post!).</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Test signals</h3>



<p>I will be testing gradients on three test images:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Siemens star</strong> – a test pattern useful to test different “angles” and different frequencies,</li><li>A simple <strong>box</strong> – has corners that can immediately show problems,</li><li>1 0 1 0 <strong>stripe</strong> pattern – frequencies exactly at Nyquist.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/y4CZ84at7ie-Rg3S_l1OQLy0qhoBmxHJXkZukiypUwb55r4dQWIPwGwG1qsdNyKCYqlhkG1TBsaYxOFTXhOFNsCIh47xyYCF5tvX6EhCAXAqORWSOOcWuxs0dF2nSyjyk_4NQan_" alt=""><figcaption>Test patterns / images</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Siemens star was rendered at 16x resolution and downsampled with a <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/04/14/bilinear-texture-filtering-artifacts-alternatives-and-frequency-domain-analysis/">sharp antialiasing filter </a>(windowed sinc). There is some aliasing in the center, but it’s ok for our use-case (we want to see a sharp signal change there and then detect it).</p>



<h2>Forward differences</h2>



<p>The first, most intuitive approach is computing <strong>forward difference</strong>.</p>



<p>This is an approximation of <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hPi-mgITwovkqTtAMg1LBk4GVXtKJqG15oSJn0MgJqljSZYk1CiM-mHoGYsW36452xxG3f2X9-72nQ2XVrTknF9v0IanFpTiRHsoGzPk-L_uVBComQrtujBayBlq_uDvpnF5HNVF" width="22" height="39"> by computing f(x+1) – f(x).</p>



<p>What I love about this solution is that it is both intuitive, naive, as well as theoretically motivated! I don’t want to rephrase the wikipedia and most of readers of my blog don’t care so much for formal proofs, so feel free to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference">have a look there</a>, or in specialized courses (<strong>side note</strong>: 2010s+ are amazing, with so many best professors sharing their course slides openly on the internet…). It’s basically built around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor expansion</a> of the f(x+1) – f(x).</p>



<p>This difference operator is the same as <strong>convolving the image with a [-1, 1] filter</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s easy, works reasonably well, is useful. But there are two bigger problems.</p>



<h3>Problem 1 – even-shift</h3>



<p>If you have <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2021/02/15/bilinear-down-upsampling-pixel-grids-and-that-half-pixel-offset/">read my previous blog post</a> – on bilinear down/upsampling – one of challenges might be visible right away. Convolving with an <strong>even-sized filter</strong>, <strong>shifts the whole image </strong>by a half a pixel.</p>



<p>It’s easily visible as well:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Mep5NBimKpkG1wHi1JFZ64tEeZH-Bavx8qZ9abnfIG8f_-vAvZERVKQs84hUSbPSiYkjVmBzyjWbTgL2oSWWyQTwuO1z2xv98LOjHp4pHsD4C09msAmnU9Z5U5Q4VO1rdAIgI24Q" alt=""><figcaption>Images vs image gradient magnitude. Notice the shift to left/top.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Depending on the application, this can be a problem or not. “A solution” is simple – undo it with another even sized filter. Perfect solution would be resampling, but resampling by a half pixel is surprisingly challenging (see my <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/04/14/bilinear-texture-filtering-artifacts-alternatives-and-frequency-domain-analysis/">another blog post</a>), so instead we can blur it with a symmetric filter. Blurring the gradient magnitude fixes it (at the cost of blur):</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ki309swxJtWYakp2nypvE4UjcgYC0uHBduyuyWzr_pamfzXFHjSlctrfAx1XPJYjk8LIECMlbRkvumjbT1TJkM225HiIggoy3lnu508mDUyDlHfRB2tog1VY82GLMcP61LK6GOO9" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Blurring with an even sized filter fixes the even sized shift. But one other problem might have became much more visible right now.</p>



<p>Note: You might wonder, what would happen if we would <strong>blur just the partial differences</strong> instead? We will see in a second.</p>



<p>But let’s focus on another, more serious problem.</p>



<h3>Problem 2 – different gradient positions for partial differences</h3>



<p><strong>Second problem</strong> is more severe; what happens if we compute <strong>multiple partial derivatives</strong>; like df/dx and df/dy this way?</p>



<p><strong>Partial derivatives are approximated at different positions!</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/l11K2D7VeRoitc_dAIwMoC5WB4RPBdcKcdDtq4ysm9z-0LzJICmias8fhGIZQWvdEzJElkTp2xCMRxn1z5EbbYH5xb7Le2AlPFhr4ynlultytNqtm98b1n9d6f_Etu3mMTxpjUiF" alt=""><figcaption>Notice how gradient being defined between pixels means that two partial forward derivatives are defined at different points! This is a big problem.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s have a look at the same plot again, this time focusing on “symmetry”. This shows why it’s a real, not just theoretical issue. If we look at gradients of a Siemens star and the box, we can see some <strong>asymmetry</strong>:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DxZNozMlWMM6xr2c3NejQXpHB9xbiwfs1GyRBeUBQIMoksEisVz5n3jGZs5zWrPZU6xeUvnBaalc3IPTIV8LDoYevY-ZirN-Gsc-XOLwBiGSRzUCuvqIqio3AcmvU5_b1eKzj2aS" alt="" width="507" height="502"><figcaption>Notice left-top gradients being stronger for Siemens star, and producing a “hole” on the box corner. Oops.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is definitely not good and will cause problems in image processing or computing normals, but it’s even worse if we look at the gradient magnitude of a simple “square” in the center of the image – notice what happens to the image corners, <strong>one corner is cut off, and another one 2x too intense</strong>!</p>



<p>This is a big problem for any real application. We need to look at better approximations.</p>



<h2>Central differences</h2>



<p>I mentioned that “blurring” partial derivatives can “recenter” them, right? What if I told you that it is also <strong>numerically more accurate</strong>? This is the so-called <strong>central difference</strong>.</p>



<p>It is evaluated by <img data-attachment-id="4275" data-permalink="https://bartwronski.com/2021/02/28/computing-gradients-on-grids-forward-central-and-diagonal-differences/gif/" data-orig-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif" data-orig-size="155,39" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gif" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif?w=155" data-large-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif?w=155" src="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif" alt="">. The division by two is important and intuitively can be understood as dividing by the distance between the pixels, or the differential dx, where dx is 2x larger.</p>



<p>When forward difference was an approximation accurate to the O(h), this one is more accurate, to O(h^2). I won’t explain those terms here, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Relation_with_derivatives">the wikipedia has some basic intro</a>, and in numerical methods literature you can find a more detailed explanation.</p>



<p>It is also <strong>equivalent to “blurring” the forward difference with a [0.5, 0.5] filter</strong>! [0.5, 0.5] o [-1, 1] leads to [-0.5, 0, 0.5]. I was initially very surprised by this connection – of a more accurate, theoretically motivated Taylor expansion, and just “some random ad-hoc practical blur”. This is even sized blur, so this also fixes the half pixel shift problem and centers both partial derivatives correctly:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QawQ4QcbqusIHhs7S0h2kekS4VQDqHCS_WizBd7dgstoHaLu5Lwj9bx_SbJImHNZnlc_aSs7FCzdYF0RW7oYjTTF3qzfoKiNENFh4yzTiYYt_GSO6lkFe-7lP2GpDs0G9XNYS52O" alt="" width="424" height="420"><figcaption>Central difference leads to perfectly symmetric (though not isotropic) results!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Problem – missing center…</p>

	<p>From <a href="https://omarshehata.me/notebook">Omar's notebook</a>.</p>
	<hr>
	
	
	<p>
		If you pull up a tuner app on your phone and play an A note on a piano, the tuner will say ~440 hz. Do the same thing on a violin's A note and you'll also get 440 hz.  
	</p>
	<p>
		This seemed impossible based on my understanding of sound, which was: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Our ears perceive sound by picking up on the frequency of the air vibrating around us.</li>
		<li>Two sounds are different if they have different frequencies, in the same way two colors appear different if they emit light of different wavelengths.</li>
		<li>When we say a sound is 440 hz, that means a point vibrating along that sound wave makes a complete cycle 440 times per second.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		So if two sound waves have exactly the same frequency, according to my tuner app, they cannot possibly sound different. But they do! Does that mean there's something else, something <i>more</i> than frequency that can differentiate sound? 
	</p>
	<p>
		There isn't! That's all sound is - vibrations in the air of some specific frequency. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Was the tuner lying? Yes, kind of: when we say a sound is 440 hz, that's not actually a complete description of the sound. It's kind of like telling you a shape has 4 points - you might assume it's a square. But it could be a rectangle, or some completely wacky irregular polygon. 
	</p>
	<h2>Visualizing a couple notes</h2>
	<p>
		Here's an A note from a piano and a violin that I recorded from online virtual instruments. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Click "Play" to hear them. Below each is a small slice of the audio. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Drag and drop your own sound file in these diagrams to use it throughout the article.</p>
	<p>
		They look structurally similar, but they're <i>not</i> the same sound wave. They both have a pattern that repeats ~3 times in 9 milliseconds (or ~440 times per second). So that's what makes them both 440 hz.
	</p>
	<p>
		But that pattern itself that repeats is different. This is why saying "A sound is 440 hz" isn't a complete description, so assumption (3) for me was a misunderstanding.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is what the sound would look like if the speaker vibrated exactly 440 times per second in a continuous, regular, motion.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The fact that all 3 of these sound different, even though they are all made of a pattern that repeats at 440 hz, tells me I need to tweak assumption (1). Our ears don't pick up on just a single frequency in the air. If they did, these sounds would be indistinguishable (which I think actually happens for our eyes, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)">metamerism</a>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		So our ears can detect the internal structure of these patterns. To decompose this structure on a computer, we'll use the Fourier transform.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Performing the Fourier Transform
	</h3>
	<p>
		The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm allows you to extract frequencies in a signal.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our signal in this case is a list of amplitudes, how loud the sound is at every sample.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you run the signal through like <code>FFT(signal)</code> you get a list numbers that correspond to a list of frequencies. For example, if the FFT output looks like this:
	</p>
	<p><code>
		[0.001, 0.1, 0.7, 0, 12, 0, 2, 1]
	</code></p><p>
		You'll also have a corresponding list of frequencies:
	</p>
	<p><code>
		[0, 55, 110, 220, 440, 880, 1320, 1760]
	</code></p><p>
		We interpret this to mean 440 is the most significant frequency in this signal, because its FFT coefficient is 12 (the largest), and it's the 5th number. And the 5th frequency in our list is 440. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I've found it easiest to interpret the results of FFT by putting it in a table in terms of the original sound frequency and the relative weights (so I divide all of them by the largest number).
	</p>
	<p>
		Below are the FFT results running on our two 9 ms slices. <a id="compute-fft" href="#">Click to expand</a> the chosen slices. You can also scroll back up to change the slices by hand.
	</p>
	<div id="fft-table-container">
		<div id="fft-table-A-container">
			<h4>Piano A note</h4>
			<p>(<span id="piano-fft-slice-number">10</span> ms slice)</p>
			<table id="fft-table-A">
			  <thead>
			    <tr>
			      <th>Freq. (hz)</th>
			      <th>Weight (%)</th>
			    </tr>
			  </thead>
			  <tbody>
				<tr>
					<td> N/A </td>
					<td> N/A </td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
		</div>
		<div id="fft-table-B-container">
			<h4>Violin A note</h4>
			<p>(<span id="violin-fft-slice-number">10</span> ms slice)</p>
			<table id="fft-table-B">
			  <thead>
			    <tr>
			      <th>Freq. (hz)</th>
			      <th>Weight (%)</th>
			    </tr>
			  </thead>
			  <tbody>
			  	<tr>
					<td> N/A </td>
					<td> N/A </td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>Frequencies below 1% weight are omitted from this table.</p>
	<p>
		These tables tell us that both sounds do have ~440 hz as the strongest frequency, but there's other frequencies inside too! The violin one appears a lot more complex, in that it seems to contain a lot more frequencies that contribute significantly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The last step is reconstructing the sound from this table. Representing sound this way is really powerful. This is the basis for a lot of sound analysis/transformations like:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Compression?</b> Remove the highest frequencies that our ears can't hear as easily. </li>
		<li><b>Noise filtering?</b> Remove specific known frequencies, that's how you can remove the sound of car horns but keep your voice in a recording.</li>
		<li><b>Auto tune?</b> Check which musical note is closest to the list of frequencies in the sound, and alter/remove/add frequencies to make it sound closer to the note.</li>
		<li><b>Voice recognition?</b> You can think of the frequencies you can create by talking as a unique pattern a software can search for. Like how the letter "E" appears ~11% of the time in most English text. We all have a few frequencies in our voices that appear with predictable probability.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Below is a sandbox for you to explore these ideas of sound reconstruction.
	</p> 
	<p>
		The code returns a <code>outputMultipliers</code> array that scales the original frequencies. A new sound is reconstructed from those new frequencies/weights. You can try <a href="#" id="zero-out">zero-ing out all the high frequencies</a>, or isolate <a href="#" id="single-frequency">a single frequency</a>.

	<h3>
		Takeaways
	</h3>
	<p>
		So the correct version of assumption (3) is: When we say a sound is 440 hz, we mean that's the frequency with the most weight in the signal. To give a complete description of the sound you need to know (1) all the frequencies it's made of and (2) how much of each frequency to use.  
	</p>
	<p>
		I created this to learn how FFT works. This is the end-to-end demonstration I was looking for to help me understand it. It's best used to test your understanding while reading other materials. I don't have the source code up yet but if you'd like to extend this or use it as a teaching tool just let me know! 
	</p>
	<p>
	 	You can drag and drop any sound file in the very first two figures and all figures will update to use it, including the FFT tables and the code sandbox. Here's a few notes from <a href="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/sound-samples/">Philharmonia</a> you can try dragging in:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://omarshehata.me/static/whoisomar/images/notebook/sound/banjo_a4.mp3" download="">Banjo A note</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://omarshehata.me/static/whoisomar/images/notebook/sound/flute_a4.mp3" download="">Flute A note</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://omarshehata.me/static/whoisomar/images/notebook/sound/saxophone_a4.mp3" download="">Saxophone A note</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		A few key points I needed for a correct implementation:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>How to retrieve the original frequencies from the FFT output.</b> The FFT only tells you the frequency in terms of how often it repeats in the list of samples. So you need to multiple by the sample rate (like 44100 for most sound) to get frequency per second (Hz). Most FFT libraries in JS do NOT give you a list of the frequencies (just the coefficients). The formula for figuring out what frequency corresponds to what coefficient <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4364823/how-do-i-obtain-the-frequencies-of-each-value-in-an-fft/4371627#4371627" target="_blank">is described here</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>You have to take a small slice of the audio.</b> Given that the frequency of the sound changes over time, even when playing a single note, you won't get accurate/expected frequencies if you FFT the entire thing. For example, a piano note has an "attack" and a "decay", you want to take a slice from the middle. 
			<ul>
				<li>See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform">Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT)</a>. This is computing FFT for a small slice of audio as we just did, but do this for all slices of the audio. You'll get a list of frequencies over time. This is often visualized as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>You have to sample an integer number of cycles.</b> If you take an arbitrary slice of a pure A note, you likely will get a lot more than 440 in your FFT table, unless you happen to pick a start and an end that matches a multiple of the cycle length. This article automatically shortens any slice to the nearest cycle (we figure that out by finding the nearest sample where the signal crosses the Y axis). This is also important when playing the reconstructed sound on loop (otherwise you hear a popping sound).
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>The discrete fourier transform (DFT) doesn't include all possible frequencies.</b> In theory, FFT is a continuous sum (AKA an integral) of all possible frequencies in the audio. What we have implemented here is a discrete version, where we sum a finite list of frequencies. In a small slice you may not get 440 exactly as an output, only because it wasn't included as a frequency the algorithm was looking for. I <i>think</i> in principle you could have an implementation that allows you to specify what frequencies must be included (if you know what you're looking for) but I haven't seen such an implementation.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>FFT isn't magic.</b> A popular analogy is that FFT can take a smoothie and extract all the component that went into it. But this seems impossible??? The trick is the FFT comes in with an assumption of what frequencies might be in there. We go through each possible frequency and ask "How much 440 hz is in this sound?" and "How much 880 hz is in this sound?" and so on. So it's closer to having an unknown substance and figuring out what it is by checking if it reacts to known chemicals/substances.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A few insights I learned from exploring the code sandbox:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>The sum of all the frequencies &lt; 1% weight have a big effect.</b> I had these hidden in the FFT tables thinking they weren't significant, and any one of them isn't, but removing them altogether does have a very noticeable effect. Here's a <a href="#" id="remove-low-weight">code snippet</a> (scroll up) that removes all frequencies with weight less than 1%. Or try the opposite, listen to only weights less than 1%.</li>
		<li><b>The high frequencies are a big part of the violin sound.</b> Removing anything at 5000 hz and up makes it no longer really sound like a violin (or just sound really muted). This isn't true for the piano.</li>
		<li><b>A string tuned to 440 hz will never emit frequencies any lower than that</b>. This is true because of the physics of standing waves, but it was really cool to learn about this in theory, and then go back to this interface and see that this was indeed true for all the recordings of notes I had! Without having known this before I …</li></ul></div></div>

       trajectory in Europe is in decline. The U.S. car maker delivered 1,619 battery-electric vehicles to 18 key European markets in January, representing 3.5% of all battery-electric vehicles registered that month, according to a report based on public data by automotive analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/auto_schmidt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthias Schmidt</a>. In 2020, Tesla delivered 1,977 vehicles in January — more than a 5% market share.</p><div>
<p>Those 18 markets include the European Union states — minus 13 countries in Central and Eastern Europe — as well as the U.K., Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Schmidt called Tesla’s January performance “consistently low,” noting that the company’s European delivery schedule sees volumes peak at the end of each quarter. However, the analyst noted that Tesla’s 12-month rolling volumes have now fallen behind Hyundai<br>

<p>Tesla comfortably topped the European EV charts in 2019. It delivered more than 109,000 vehicles that year, making up 31% of the region’s battery-electric-vehicle market. But the tide turned in 2020, with Tesla dropping behind both the brands of Volkswagen Group<br>

<p>Last year, Tesla made up just 13% of the European market despite a smaller proportional decline in the number of vehicles it delivered — around 10% — from 109,000 in 2019 to nearly 98,000 in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Schmidt, who publishes the <a href="https://www.schmidtmatthias.de/electriccarreports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Electric Car Report</a>, it was the introduction of emissions targets, and the specter of massive fines, that accelerated the European car makers’ battle against Tesla for dominance.</p>

<p>More broadly in January, China raced past Europe to reclaim its crown as the world’s largest market for electric vehicles. There were 179,000 battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles registered in China in January, compared with 110,000 in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The boost in China comes after a standout year for Europe. There were 1.33 million electric-vehicle registrations in Europe in 2020, topping 1.25 million in China, amid a pedal-to-the-metal push to increase EV adoption from European governments and supercharged demand from consumers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Managing data is hard. Managing data pipelines is even harder. The meaning of individual tables or values in your data warehouse gets lost in translation across organizations. Another team’s refactor breaks your team’s pipeline. And, it’s normally very difficult to tell who made what change and when.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a>, data build tool, alleviates these frustrations by taking over the transformation step in your ETL pipelines. <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/what--exactly--is-dbt-/">dbt is not itself a data processor</a>, but instead sits on top of your data warehouse that contains your already extracted and loaded data. dbt allows teams to easily test, document, and version-control their data transformations.</p>
<p>While dbt is a great tool for transforming batch data, it cannot currently transform streaming data in real time. (The dbt team explicitly warns users about this in a <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/is-dbt-the-right-tool-for-my-data-transformations/">few</a> <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-to-create-near-real-time-models-with-just-dbt-sql/1457">places</a>.) Here at <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, we want to help the world stop batching and start streaming. So we* built a dbt adapter that will allow you to transform your streaming data in real time using Materialize as your data warehouse.</p>
<p>The rest of this post will explore why dbt works best with batch data and how using Materialize unlocks streaming transformations. If you’re eager to get started, the <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/misc/dbt-materialize">dbt-materialize adapter is here</a>, and our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/play/wikirecent-dbt">sample streaming project is here</a>. Note: The dbt-materialize adapter is an <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5462">active work in progress</a> and not yet suitable for production use-cases. Please file issues or submit PRs as you see fit, we love feedback!</p>
<p>*The dbt-materialize adapter was originally created by Josh Wills and actively shaped by Jeremy Cohen. Thank you for all of your work and support!</p>
<h2>dbt and batch data</h2>
<p>dbt is great at transforming batch data, but it cannot transform streaming data efficiently in real time. To understand why, let’s take a look at how dbt transforms data under the hood.</p>
<p>dbt users define their desired transformations using <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/">dbt “models”</a>. dbt models are SQL files that contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>A SELECT statement that performs the desired transformation</li>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/materializations/">“materialization”</a> parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>dbt transforms your data each time you <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/run/">“run”</a> a model. Each time a model is run, dbt queries the underlying data warehouse using that model’s SELECT statement. The result set of the query (the transformed data) is then either returned directly to the user or persisted into your data warehouse, depending on the model’s materialization parameter.</p>
<p>Currently, dbt supports four types of materializations: <em>table</em>, <em>view</em>, <em>incremental</em>, and <em>ephemeral</em>. The <em>table</em> and <em>incremental</em> materializations persist a table, the <em>view</em> materialization creates a view, and the <em>ephemeral</em> materialization, instead of persisting anything, returns results directly using a common table expression (CTE). The good news is that these database objects are totally sufficient to transform batch data. The bad news is that none of these database objects transform streaming data efficiently.</p>
<p>First, what do I mean by batch and streaming data? Batch data, as the name suggests, is any type of data that arrives in discrete batches. This can be once a minute, once an hour, or once a day. The important thing is that no new data arrives between batches. Streaming data, on the other hand, arrives continually and at no particular schedule.</p>
<p>So, why are these database objects sufficient to transform batch data, but not able to efficiently transform streaming data?</p>
<p>Views and CTEs do not physically persist data to your data warehouse. This means that each time you query a model that uses a view or CTE, your data warehouse must re-transform the underlying source data. And, each time you transform your source data, you are paying some cost. While views and CTEs always return up-to-date transformations of your batch and streaming data, they do not do so efficiently.</p>
<p>Tables, on the other hand, do physically persist data. More specifically, tables persist the result set of the last time their model “dbt run.” Unlike views and CTEs, this means that you won’t pay the price of transforming data each time your table is queried. But, this means that your transformed data can quickly become stale as new data arrives. This is not an issue with batch data because you can simply “dbt run” your table each time a new batch arrives. Unfortunately, things aren’t so simple with streaming data.</p>
<p>Because streaming data does not arrive on a schedule, there is no longer a right time to re-run your models to keep them up-to-date. Instead, you’re forced to choose between maximizing data freshness and minimizing transformation costs. You can minimize your costs by limiting how often you recreate your tables, effectively turning your streaming data into batch data. Or, you can maximize your data freshness by continually recreating your tables. But, this approach will cost you time and money, leave you vulnerable to bugs, and still won’t maintain truly up-to-date results.</p>
<p>So, what should you do if you want to transform streaming data with dbt?</p>
<h2>dbt and streaming data</h2>
<p>dbt currently has one official and one unofficial way to approximate transforming streaming data. Neither of these methods truly transforms streaming data in real-time, and both come at a cost.</p>
<p>The first method to approximate transforming streaming data is to create models with an incremental materialization. The first time you run an incremental model, dbt persists your transformation’s result set into a table in your data warehouse. For subsequent runs, dbt only transforms the subset of source data indicated by your model’s filter predicate. (For example, you might have a filter predicate that will only transform data with a timestamp greater than your last model’s run.)</p>
<p>While incremental models reduce the severity of the tradeoff that users face when persisting their transformations in tables (data freshness vs cost), they do not eliminate the tradeoff entirely. By design, you will probably be paying a lesser cost each time you “dbt run” an incremental model. (I say “probably” here because even though you’re only transforming a few rows of data with each run, unless you’re filtering cleverly, your model’s SELECT statement will still have to scan the entire underlying source table or view to discover these rows). While these lesser costs may free you up to run your incremental models more frequently, you still will not be able to run them continuously. By definition, you are still transforming your streaming data with a batch process.</p>
<p>The second way to approximate transforming streaming data is the <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-to-create-near-real-time-models-with-just-dbt-sql/1457">unofficial “lambda view” approach</a>. This method simulates transformations over “near real-time models” by querying a combined historical table and a current view. This approach incurs the cost of querying both of the underlying database objects using some filter, similar to the incremental materialization. The current view of your data returns up-to-date results, but must re-transform the recent data each time.</p>
<p>Neither of these methods can efficiently transform data in real time. (And, they come with <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/on-the-limits-of-incrementality/303">hairy problems</a> if, say, you have streaming data that might arrive late.) In order to efficiently perform worry-free, real-time transformations of streaming data, dbt would need to persist a database object that updates as new data arrives upstream. Luckily, there is a database object that can do this for us: materialized views.</p>
<h2>dbt and Materialize</h2>
<p>Materialized views in traditional databases behave a bit like dbt’s incremental materialization. When a materialized view is first created, the result set of its query is physically persisted in the database. Then, at some interval or when manually triggered, the stored result set is updated with recent data. Like the incremental materialization, maintaining these materialized views incurs a variety of costs.</p>
<p>This is the exact problem Materialize was created to solve. Unlike traditional materialized views, <a href="https://materialize.com/why-use-a-materialized-view/">our materialized views</a> continually update as new data arrives–no refreshes needed. Better yet, we provide up-to-date results with millisecond latency. (For more information about Materialize and our materialized views, check out <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/">our documentation</a>.)</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for dbt and streaming data? This means that the first time you run a dbt model on top of Materialize, dbt persists a materialized view. <strong>Then, you never have to run your model again.</strong> No matter how much or how frequently your data arrives, your model will stay up to date. No matter when you query your view, it will return a fresh answer. Just by creating your model with our materialized views, you can confidently and efficiently transform streaming data in real time.</p>
<h2>Try it out!</h2>
<p>Excited? Skeptical? Cautiously optimistic? Try it out for yourself! As mentioned before, we have a <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/misc/dbt-materialize">beta dbt-adapter</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/play/wikirecent-dbt">demo streaming project</a>. If you have any thoughts, questions, or concerns, please feel free to contact us in our community Slack or in our dbt repos. (Or, when you’re up and running, tell us what you’re transforming in real time!)</p>

<p>
I've been wanting org to keep track of my daily habits for a little while. The catalist: reading James Clear's wonderful <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> (along with plenty of lock-down inspiration).
</p>

<p>
As much as I live in Emacs and org mode, it just wasn't practical enough to rely on my laptop for tracking habits. I wanted less friction, so I've been experimenting with building a toy app for my needs. Naturally, org support was a strict requirement, so I could always poke at it from my beloved editor.
</p>

<p>
I've been using the app every day with success. The habits seem to be sticking, but equally important, it's been really fun to join the fabulous world of Emacs/Org with iOS/SwiftUI.
</p>

<p>
This is all very experimental<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> and as mentioned on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ljurwx/org_habits_ios_app_want_to_try_it/">reddit</a> (follow-up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lp62vn/org_habits_ios_app_followup_twoway_edit/">here</a>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1361034010047176705">twitter</a>, the app isn't available on the App Store. I may consider publishing if there's enough interest, but in the mean time, you can reach out and install via <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/">TestFlight</a>.
</p>

<p>
Send me an email address to <i>flathabits*at*xenodium.com</i> for a TestFlight invite.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>So here you are, you’ve built a tool for the Chrome Web Store and suddenly you’ve been bestowed with a<strong> couple of thousand users across the globe</strong>.</p><p>One question, would be how to monetise such an impressive piece of tech you’ve created.</p><p>If you’ve spent your time on an Android or iOS, the path to monetisation are far easy &amp; a lot simplier. Somehow, however, <strong>Chrome Extensions don’t carry the same weight</strong> in the mind of the user. They are much more inclined to pay for an app or an ongoing service but Chrome Extensions wind up in the realm of “should be free.”</p><p>A lot of chrome extensions are the child of a large product or a global product itself, cases such as Honey, the coupon finder &amp; Grammerly are super giants that don’t really fall into the realm of developer accidently making a tool valuable to thousands.</p><p>There seems to be a vat of extensions floating around the 20k to 50k mark, not been updated since 2015. What do to?</p><p>Rather than give you a list of things<strong> untried or untested with affiliate links attached, let’s run through stories that I know.</strong></p><p>There's a new platform called <a href="https://monetise.so/">Monetise.so</a>, they have built a Chrome Extension billing platform as a direct replacement for the upcoming sunset of the Chrome Web Store Payments.</p><p>Check them out : <a href="https://monetise.so/">https://monetise.so</a></p><p>It’s no secret that Adblock Plus with their ~100 Million global users have profited from the blockage of adverts existing on internet.</p><p>The business model is unique &amp; simple, they allowed certain whitelisted ads through, non-intrusive and Google paid them an undisclosed amount.</p><p>They are not the only ones who do what they do, but they’re very good at it.<br>They aggregate affiliate schemes across the internet and put them into a single JS file for you to plugin to your site. They also built something for Chrome Extensions, after you include in your code, they will start including logos on Google Search Results, like so:</p><figure><img src="https://tillypay.com/blog/content/images/2020/02/1-tf0Kx1jGsc5mmRHPo7VYXA.png"></figure><p>The DJI link is now monetised and everyone is happy, the user who is paying somewhat for the extension, the extension developer but not Google Chrome, understandably.</p><p>This is malvertising, it’s advertising in a malware way of including unwanted code. Even with it’s horrid name, if privacy is not your thing, then there’s very little impacting the end user. The issue comes when you are allowing a third party with that much access to your google searches, maybe not.</p><p>Actually, I do have access to the maths on this:</p><ul><li><strong>50,000 Weekly Users resulted in about €2.2k a month.</strong></li><li>That’s about <strong>4.4 cent per user,</strong> mostly from Tier 1 GEOs (US, UK, FR, DE)</li></ul><p>Google will kick you out if they find this.<br>It's happened time &amp; time again.</p><p>Revolution, is what they called it.<br>A new way to monetise the internet.</p><p>Yes, but no. Firstly, the UX for your end-user sucks balls.<br>Their brand new computer is down to it’s last leg trying to get the you (the developer), $0.0002 per minute of agony.</p><p>Also, I’ve tried this.<br>I had 10k Weekly Users, that turned into about 30 concurrent users on average at any one time.</p><p>I made $16 a month from Coinhive at 25% of his user’s CPU.</p><p>Back to the drawing board.</p><p><em>Freemium</em><br>Popular topic on the lips of SaaS models, provide something a bit more &amp; users are willing to pay for it. The problem you may have is that you product just isn’t worth a cup of coffee a month. On a popular VPN Chrome extension, they managed to get 50k users a month to pay for their premium product out of a user base of 4 million MAU. Their premium product was pretty damn great too.</p><p>Here are some great stories of Chrome Extensions being monetised in this way:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/how-sharing-helpful-knowledge-helped-me-grow-to-2-500-month-ad9b94660e">Weather App</a> - $2.5k MRR</li><li><a href="https://beebs.io/">Beebs</a> - <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/from-no-coding-skills-to-50k-downloads-in-two-years-eca7ea8587">$5K MRR</a></li><li>Nighteye, nightmode - <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/night-eye">$2.3k MRR</a></li></ul><p><em>Paid-Only</em><br>Yes, this works well if your product is good enough for the switch.<br>Might be fairly difficult to encourage users to pay for the simple RSS extension you created.</p><p><em>Paywall or not to Paywall</em><br>Paywalling your current userbase guarantees the maximum number of conversions in that time period, everything else is bad news. Chrome extensions have review mechanisms that mean you’ll paywall your userbase &amp; they turn to the review board for revenge. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/media-hint/akipcefbjlmpbcejgdaopmmidpnjlhnb" rel="noopener nofollow">See here</a>.</p><p>I decided to paywall all the new users but keep the old users free. This way I had 50,000 people who loved &amp; would recommend the extension and a steady stream of newcomers who some (5%) of them would pay a monthly subscription for it.</p><p><strong>The best way to start paywalling is to use <a href="https://monetise.so/">Monetise.so</a>, they are a direct replacement of the Chrome Web Store.</strong></p><p>This could be a possibility for you, I know of a few examples this works well:</p><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-for-a-cause/gibkoahgjfhphbmeiphbcnhehbfdlcgo?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow">Tab for a Cause</a><br>They have a new tab page with an advert on it, they donate roughly ~30% of their Gross Revenue to charities.</p><p>Total Q1 2019 Revenue: <strong>$139,395.93.</strong><br>$0.25 per user per month, not bad at all.</p><p>They have, what you probably don’t is a lot of coverage being at the new tab page of every single user.</p><p><a href="http://ecosia.org/" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Ecosi</strong></a>a is the tree planting search engine, uses its advert revenue into planting trees across the planet.

  <p>Summary: I believe that small websites are compelling aesthetically, but are also important to help us resist selling our souls to large tech companies. In this essay I present a vision for the “small web” as well as the small software and architectures that power it. Also, a bonus rant about microservices.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>About fifteen years ago, I read E. F. Schumacher’s <em>Small is Beautiful</em> and, despite not being interested in economics, I was moved by its message. Perhaps even more, I loved the terse poetry of the book’s title – it resonated with my frugal upbringing and my own aesthetic.</p>

<p>I think it’s time for a version of that book about technology, with a chapter on web development: <em>The Small Web is Beautiful: A Study of Web Development as if People Mattered.</em> Until someone writes that, this essay will have to do.</p>

<p>There are two aspects of this: first, <strong>small teams and companies</strong>. I’m not going to talk much about that here, but <a href="https://basecamp.com/books">Basecamp</a> and many others have. What I’m going to focus on in this essay is <strong>small websites and architectures</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m not the first to talk about the “small web”, but, somewhat surprisingly, only a few people have discussed it using that term. Here are the main web pages I can find that do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">Rediscovering the Small Web</a> by Parimal Satyal: a fabulous article about the joy of small, independent (and sometimes retro) websites in contrast to the “commercial web”.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">What is the Small Web?</a>, by Aral Balkan of the Small Technology Foundation: more of a manifesto against the surveillance of Big Tech than something concrete, but still interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why aim small in this era of fast computers with plenty of RAM? A number of reasons, but the ones that are most important to me are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fewer moving parts. It’s easier to create more robust systems and to fix things when they do go wrong.</li>
  <li>Small software is faster. Fewer bits to download and clog your computer’s memory.</li>
  <li>Reduced power consumption. This is important on a “save the planet” scale, but also on the very local scale of increasing the battery life of your phone and laptop.</li>
  <li>The light, frugal aesthetic. That’s personal, I know, but as you’ll see, I’m not alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s dive in. I want to cover a bunch of different angles, each with its own subheading.</p>

<h2 id="small-software">Small software</h2>

<p>If we’re going to talk about a small web, we need to start with small <em>software</em>.</p>

<p>As a teen, I learned to program using x86 assembly and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> – perhaps odd choices, but my dad was heavily into Forth, and I loved how the language was so simple I could write <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/third">my own bootstrapped compiler</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of career, I started as an embedded programmer – not as in “embedded Linux” but as in microcontrollers where 16KB of RAM was generous. My current laptop has 16GB of RAM, and that’s not a lot by today’s standards. We were building IP-networked products with <em>one millionth</em> the amount of RAM. Those kinds of micros are as cheap as chips (ahem), and still widely used for small electronic devices, sensors, internet-of-things products, and so on.</p>

<p>You have to think about every byte, compile with size optimizations enabled, and reuse buffers. It’s a very different thing from modern web development, where a JavaScript app compiles “down” to a 1MB bundle, or a single Python object header is 16 bytes before you’ve even got any data, or a Go hello-world binary is 2MB even before you’ve added any real code.</p>

<p>How do you create small programs? I think the main thing is that you have to <em>care about size</em>, and most of us don’t think we have time for that. Apart from embedded development, there’s an entire programming subculture called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a> that cares about this. They have competitions for the smallest 4KB demos: who can pack the most graphical punch into 4096 bytes of executable. That’s smaller than many favicons! (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB0vBmiTr6o">Elevated</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCh3Q08HMfs">cdak</a> are two of the highest-rated 4K demos.) Many demosceners go on to become game developers.</p>

<p>It’s not just about executable size … when you’re developing your next command line tool, if you use Go or Rust or even C, your program will be much faster, smaller, and use less memory than a Python or Java equivalent. And easier to install. If you don’t understand why, please do learn. (It’s out of scope for this essay, but to summarize: Go, Rust, and C compile to ready-to-execute machine code, don’t carry around a virtual machine, and don’t have memory overhead for objects like integers.)</p>

<p>But why not apply some of the same principles to web development? In the web world, I think the main trick is to be careful what dependencies you include, and also what dependencies <em>they</em> pull in. In short, know <code>node_modules</code> – or maybe better, <em>no</em> <code>node_modules</code>. More about this <a href="#fewer-dependencies">below</a>.</p>

<p>Niklaus Wirth of Pascal fame wrote a famous paper in 1995 called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf">A Plea for Lean Software [PDF]</a>. His take is that “a primary cause for the complexity is that software vendors uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want”, and “when a system’s power is measured by the number of its features, quantity becomes more important than quality”. He goes on to describe Oberon, a computer language (which reminds me of Go in several ways) and an operating system that he believes helps solve the complexity problem. Definitely wirth a read!</p>

<p>I’ve been mulling over this for a number of years – back in 2008 I wrote a sarcastic dig at how bloated Adobe Reader had become: <a href="https://blog.brush.co.nz/2008/07/adobe-reader-9/">Thank you, Adobe Reader 9!</a> It was a 33MB download and required 220MB of hard drive space even in 2008 (it’s now a 150MB download, and I don’t know how much hard drive space it requires, because I don’t install it these days).</p>

<p>But instead of just complaining, how do we actually solve this problem? Concretely, I think we need to start doing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Care about size: this sounds obvious, but things only change when people think they’re important.</li>
  <li>Measure: both your executable’s size, and your program’s memory usage. You may want to measure over time, and make it a blocking issue if the measurements grow more than <em>x</em>% in a release. Or you could hold a memory-reduction sprint every so often.</li>
  <li>Language: choose a backend language that has a chance, for example Rust, C or C++, or for servers, Go. These languages aren’t right for everything (like data transformation scripts), but they produce small executables, and they’re good for CLIs and desktop apps.</li>
  <li>Remove: cut down your feature set. Aim for a small number of high-quality features. My car can’t fly or float, and that’s okay – it drives well.</li>
  <li>Say no to new features: unless they really fit your philosophy, or add more than they cost over the lifetime of your project.</li>
  <li>Dependencies: understand the size and complexity of each dependency you pull in. Use only built-in libraries if you can.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="small-websites">Small websites</h2>

<p>I’m glad there’s a growing number of people interested in small websites.</p>

<p>A few months ago there was a sequence of posts to Hacker News about various “clubs” you could post your small website on: the <a href="https://1mb.club/">1MB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25151773">comments</a>), <a href="https://512kb.club/">512KB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25450451">comments</a>), <a href="https://250kb.club/">250KB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25176663">comments</a>), and even the <a href="https://10kbclub.com/">10KB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25556860">comments</a>). I think those are a fun indicator of renewed interested in minimalism, but I will say that raw size isn’t enough – a 2KB site with no real content isn’t much good, and a page with 512KB of very slow JavaScript is worse than a snappy site with 4MB of well-chosen images.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite small websites are:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a>: I personally like the minimalist, almost brutalist design, but I love its lightness even more. I just downloaded the home page, and loading all resources transfers only 21KB (61KB uncompressed). Even pages with huge comment threads only transfer about 100KB of compressed data, and load quickly. Reddit has become such a bloated mess in comparison. Hacker News, never change!</p>

<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/">Lobsters</a>: a similar news-and-voting site, with slightly more “modern” styling. It uses some JavaScript and profile icons, but it’s still clean and fast, and the total transfer size for the homepage is only 102KB. You just don’t need megabytes to make a good website.</p>

<p><a href="https://sourcehut.org/">Sourcehut</a>: I like the concept behind Drew DeVault’s business, but I love how small and anti-fluff the website is. He has set up a mini-site called the <a href="https://forgeperf.org/">Software Forge Performance Index</a> that tracks size and browser performance of the prominent source code websites – Sourcehut is far and away the lightest and fastest. Even his homepage is only 81KB, including several screenshot thumbnails.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>: not only is SQLite a small, powerful SQL database engine, the website is fantastically small and content-rich. Even their 7000-word <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html">page about testing</a> is only 70KB. How do they do this? It’s not magic: focus on high-quality textual content, minimal CSS, no JavaScript, and very few images (a small logo and some SVGs).</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/">LWN</a>: I’m a little biased, because I’ve written <a href="https://lwn.net/Archives/GuestIndex/#Hoyt_Ben">articles</a> for them, but they’re an excellent website for Linux and programming news. Extremely high-quality technical content (and a high bar for authors). They’re definitely niche, and have a “we focus on quality content, not updating our CSS every year” kind of look – they’ve been putting out great content for 23 years! Their homepage only downloads 44KB (90KB uncompressed).</p>

<p><a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu’s blog</a>: this is one of the more hardcore examples. His inline CSS is only about 200 bytes (the pages are basically unstyled), and his HTML source code doesn’t use any linefeed characters. Kind of a fun point, although then he goes on to load 20KB of Google Analytics JavaScript…</p>

<p>As a friend pointed out, those websites have something of an “anti-aesthetic aesthetic”. I confess to not minding that at all, but on the other hand, small doesn’t have to mean ugly. More and more personal blogs and websites have adopted a small web approach but are more typographically appealing:</p>

    <p>You already know that Peergos lets you store and share files securely and privately. Now, you can also host your own website on it!</p>
<p>We always thought getting a website up and running should be one of the easiest things to do on the web. There are plenty of options available for website hosting, but with Peergos there's no need to buy a domain name, arrange TLS certificates, or run a server to host the content. You also don't need any cryptocurrency to post or update your website, so you can get free instantaneous updates and peer-to-peer authenticated delivery. You can sign up to <a href="https://beta.peergos.net/?signup=true">our beta</a> today and get started right away in just two easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Upload your website files to a directory in Peergos.
</li>
<li>
Go to your profile, set that directory as your website and click publish.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Your personal website will now be available at <tt>https://&lt;your-user-name&gt;.peergos.me</tt>. It doesn't get any simpler than that. Let's see this in action!</p>
<center>
<img alt="www" id="id" src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/p2p-webhosting.gif" width="90%">
<br>
Host your decentralized website directly from Peergos.
</center>
<p>Any changes made to your website files are automatically and instantly reflected in your website. When we say instantaneous, we mean it. Check it out below!</p>
<center>
<img alt="www-update" id="id" src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/p2p-web-update.gif" width="90%">
<br>
Instantaneous and free updates to your decentralized website.
</center>
<p>When you publish a website from Peergos, you can view it through any Peergos gateway. We're running one at <tt>peergos.me</tt>, so your website will be available at <tt>https://&lt;your-user-name&gt;.peergos.me</tt>, and viewable in any browser today. Bear in mind that viewing through a public gateway like that still relies on DNS and the TLS certificate authorities, which are both single points of failure that are vulnerable to attack. However, we can actually get around both of these by viewing someone's site through a local Peergos gateway. To visit someone's site in this way, you just run a local Peergos instance and browse to <tt>http://&lt;username&gt;.peergos.localhost:9000</tt>. The gateway looks up the public key of the username provided in the localhost subdomain via the Peergos PKI, then retrieves the website and serves it. All this is done without relying on DNS or TLS certificates anywhere. We are thus able to use localhost subdomains to achieve isolation and security between different sites served from one local gateway. </p>
<p>Websites hosted on Peergos benefit from our resilient and reliable decentralized architecture. Most of the heavy lifting is done by <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> through content addressing and public key based routing. With our architecture, we add fast mutable pointers and human-readable names. Therefore, you can trust that the content of your website will be readily available without having to rely on a single-point-of-failure-server anywhere. </p>
<p>In the future, we will enable viewing such websites directly inside the Peergos web interface. At that point, Peergos will really start to look like a new web.</p>
<p>There are still a few free accounts available on <a href="https://beta.peergos.net/?signup=true">our beta</a>. Let us know what you think. We're always looking for feedback, so either <a href="mailto://peergos@peergos.org">drop us a line</a> or come say hi in our <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#peergos-chat:matrix.org">Matrix chatroom</a>.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for introductions to a few other new features and apps we're building as part of our <a href="https://peergos.org/posts/next-generation-internet">grant</a> from the Next Generation Internet program (<a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI POINTER</a>).</p>

            <!-- content --><p>SolidRun has a new development in their NXP Layerscape LX2160A based systems this week. The new SolidRun HoneyComb LX2 Server packages two of their familiar HoneyComb LX2K boards into a single chassis. This includes a power supply and accommodations for 2.5″ or 3.5″ SATA storage. While the board at the core of this system is not a new part this does mark a milestone for deploy-ability of Arm systems at a tier that does not have a lot of other attention.<span id="more-51095"></span></p>
<h2>SolidRun HoneyComb LX2 Server Background</h2>
<p>To take a step back and look at where this system lands, the Arm ecosystem currently has a lot of activity at the top and bottom of the price and performance spectrum, with not a lot of options in the middle. That is where SolidRun’s new dual-node server aims to compete.</p>

Developer kits such as these have earned a level of ubiquity in learning and DIY spaces for making it really easy to try out new concepts in programming or “physical computing.” While the Raspberry Pi Foundation has demonstrated using the Raspberry Pi 4 in production, including running Raspberry Pi 4s to serve their website for the launch of the Pi 4, that is not quite what they are designed for. In that example, the Foundation included their own hardware between more performant load balancers and database machines as a demonstration of their very capable new devices, not quite as a shot across the bow to the Xeons they may have replaced.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, several orders of magnitude away, Ampere Altra is making a case for permanently replacing some of those Xeons for certain customers. Ampere’s price-to-performance numbers are impressive, as are figures like 160 cores for a 2 socket server and 128 lanes of PCIe Gen4 per socket. This underscores that this is a platform designed for cloud providers and hyperscalers.

<p>There is enough intrigue over the top-of-line Arm servers that developers wonder if there is not a better workstation-level/ or entry/mid-range server system. A prospective Arm developer would want something between $100 for a dev board and $4000 per socket for a screaming 2U. (Apologies to the $800 32-core 1.7GHz SKU at the other end of the Ampere Altra line.)</p>
<p>SolidRun has been positioning itself in this space for several years. Its LX2 products continue in active development. HoneyComb’s maturity dovetails with the work SolidRun has been doing on two fronts. It is servicing its niche and driving specific development (for example their high bandwidth networking) but return their development work to benefit the ease of adoption from mainline Linux.</p>

<p>The HoneyComb LX2K is a COM Express Type 7 carrier for an NXP Layerscape LX2160A System-on-Chip with 16x Arm A72 cores running up to 2GHz. The COM Express Type 7 module has dual-channel DDR4 in SODIMMs for up to 64GB total. The carrier board exposes 4x SATA, one M.2 and one Micro SD slot for storage, four SFP+ (directly from the SoC) and one RJ45 at 1Gb for networking, dual USB 3.0 ports, and an open-ended PCIe x8 slot on a standard mini ITX form factor using standard ATX power. There is even the ATX standard power indicator and reset button header. The goal seems to be to create a platform that is easy to integrate into existing chassis and systems.</p>

<p>In the context of running highly deployable servers to replace Xeons, this may not be quite the same level of hardware maturity. On the other hand, having a dual-node 1U platform that one can deploy in racks and do Arm development is a big step forward. Not only do we get a bigger CPU, but we also get the ability to use a lot of standard components which will help boost the ecosystem as well. Adding a chassis with cooling and power may not seem like a big deal, but there is a large segment of the market that does not want to search for or cobble together these solutions. Instead, if the nodes are already in a 1U chassis, that lowers the friction and barriers to entry for development. This is still not a $400-500 PC or Atom server. Still, it is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>SolidRun’s HoneyComb LX2K is a platform that is accessible and capable for development on 64-bit Arm architecture as a workstation. It is also becoming more deployment-ready for appliance-type power-conscious edge applications with the 1U chassis. Developers interested in using the HoneyComb board in production have faced the challenge of trying to rack-mount an ITX board. Bamboo Systems in the UK have an answer for developers ready to deploy an 8-node 1U, but that raises the bar back up the scale of Ampere Altra. The challenge with small server nodes is that as one scales, it tends to be more efficient having larger nodes. AWS Gravition2 is an important product for the industry, but it is also tied to the AWS ecosystem. The new availability to deploy two nodes in 1U targets the intersection of accessibility and capability for those interested to kick the tires on Arm in the wild.</p>
<p>We look forward to getting our hands on the dual sled system and doing an in-depth review. We will also pair that with approaching the HoneyComb Board as a workstation for daily-driver use. Leave a comment if you would like to see specific applications explored for either system.</p>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator">Parser combinators</a> are
sets of functions for building parsers in a composable fashion. Haskell’s
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec">Parsec library</a> and OCaml’s
<a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom">Angstrom</a> are two examples.
Both of these libraries expose <em>monadic</em> interfaces for
describing context-sensitive grammars. This post looks at implementing a more
restricted parsing library, structured around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor">applicative
functors</a> rather
than monads.</p>

<p>What could justify giving up on monads? Depending on the design, one may get
a few things in return. In this exercise, the aim is for an API with the following
features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The ability to extract all valid symbols from a parser.</li>
  <li>Allow some form of pretty printing.</li>
  <li>Support multiple evaluation strategies (e.g. backtracking and non-backtracking).</li>
</ol>

<p>To see why (1) is not possible to accomplish with monads, consider a parser
constructed using the monadic <em>bind-operator</em>:</p>



<p>Here, <code>f</code> is a function of the form <code>'a -&gt; 'b parser</code>; that means we don’t
know what sort of parser it produces until it’s provided with a value. Therefore,
we cannot infer all possible symbols consumed by those parsers. The same
reasoning applies to pretty printing.</p>

<h3 id="designing-a-parser-type">Designing a parser type</h3>

<p>The essence of a parser is a function with a type analogous to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>list</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>char</span> <span>list</span><span>)</span> <span>option</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A parser takes a list of characters as input, and, when successful, returns a
parsed value along with the remaining input.</p>

<p>This representation, however, falls short of supporting symbol
extraction, pretty printing, or allowing for multiple evaluation strategies.
To accommodate for those we’d have to embellish the type with more context.
The problem is we don’t necessarily know the complete feature set upfront.
Every time a request for some new capability comes in – be it error reporting,
logging or something else – we would have to go back and change the definition
to accommodate for the new functionality.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to anticipate all use cases upfront, an alternative
approach is to choose a representation that preserves as much structure as
possible, so that alternative interpreters may be added later on. To do that,
we’re effectively going to enumerate the set of parsers, and ways of
combining them, by defining a type for representing an abstract syntax tree
(AST). To this purpose, we’ll use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type">GADT</a>, that
also expresses that different parsers are indexed by different types. The
initial constructors are split into two sets – primitive ones (the
leaf nodes of the tree), and combinators for composing parsers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>(* Primitive parsers *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Fail</span>      <span>:</span> <span>string</span>            <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Empty</span>     <span>:</span>                       <span>unit</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Return</span>    <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span>                <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Symbol</span>    <span>:</span> <span>char</span>              <span>-&gt;</span> <span>char</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>(* Composition - applicative *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Map</span>       <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Product</span>   <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>t</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>(* Composition - alternative *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Either</span>    <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The primitive parsers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Fail msg</code> - a parser that always fails.</li>
  <li><code>Empty</code> - a parser that succeeds when given empty input.</li>
  <li><code>Return x</code> - a parser that does not consume any input and always returns <code>x</code>.</li>
  <li><code>Symbol c</code> - a parser that matches input when the first character is <code>c</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The applicative interface is what provides sequential composition, as in:
first parse <code>x</code> with parser <code>p1</code>, then parse <code>y</code> with parser <code>p2</code> and combine
their results.</p>

<p>The <code>Either</code> constructor makes it possible to provide alternative execution
paths, i.e. parsers that succeed on different types of input.</p>

<p>As we don’t want to give users direct access to the type, we’ll mechanically
add some smart constructors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>Empty</span>

<span>let</span> <span>fail</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fail</span> <span>m</span>

<span>let</span> <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Return</span> <span>x</span>

<span>let</span> <span>symbol</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>c</span>

<span>let</span> <span>map</span> <span>f</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Map</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>product</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>Product</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>,</span><span>q</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>either</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>Either</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>,</span><span>q</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Having an applicative interface means that it is also possible to leverage
the new syntax extension – the <code>let+ .. and+</code> notation – which I’ve described
<a href="http://jobjo.github.io//2019/04/24/ocaml-has-some-new-shiny-syntax.html">here</a>.
Assuming OCaml 4.08 or the dune
<a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/let-syntax-backported-to-ocaml-4-02/3447">future_syntax stanza</a>
, we can add a syntax module, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Syntax</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>f</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>and</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>product</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition to these, we’ll include an <code>Ops</code> module with infix versions
and some derived combinators:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Ops</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
  <span>open</span> <span>Syntax</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>f</span> <span>p</span>   <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>f</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;|&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>   <span>=</span> <span>either</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>pf</span> <span>px</span> <span>=</span> <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>pf</span> <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>px</span> <span>in</span> <span>f</span> <span>x</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>*&gt;</span>  <span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>_</span> <span>x</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>q</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;*</span>  <span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>   <span>=</span> <span>const</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>q</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before moving on, some of the code examples also assume a few general
utility functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(* Identity *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>id</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span>

<span>(* Const *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>const</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span>

<span>(* Forward composition *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>(</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>c</span>

<span>(* Converting a char list to a string *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>string_of_list</span> <span>:</span> <span>char</span> <span>list</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>string</span>

<span>(* And back again *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>list_of_string</span> <span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>char</span> <span>list</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Their implementation, along with the complete code is available

<h3 id="building-simple-parsers">Building simple parsers</h3>

<p>How can we use the API to build actual parsers? Let’s consider a few simple
examples. First, a parser that parses a specific string, i.e. a function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>string</span> <span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>string</span> <span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To implement the <code>string</code> parser, we can use the <code>symbol</code> primitive and fold over the
given string to combine the parsers using applicative (<code>let+ .. and+)</code> syntax:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>string</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>accum</span> <span>c</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>(* Parse 'x' using the 'symbol c' parser *)</span>
    <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span>  <span>=</span> <span>symbol</span> <span>c</span>
    <span>(* Then parse 'xs' using the 'p' parser *)</span>
    <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>p</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>(* Combine 'x' and 'xs' in a string *)</span>
    <span>Printf</span><span>.</span><span>sprintf</span> <span>"%c%s"</span> <span>x</span> <span>xs</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, let’s attempt a parser for parsing digits. A version that
detects a single digit may be defined as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>digit</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>list_of_string</span> <span>"0123456789"</span>
  <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>symbol</span>
  <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>fold_left</span> <span>either</span> <span>fail</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Choosing between a list of parsers is a natural generalization of the binary <code>either</code>
combinator, and deserves its own version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>choose</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>fold_left</span> <span>either</span> <span>fail</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We may also generalize the <code>digit</code> definition to take a list of symbols as an argument:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>one_of</span> <span>cs</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span> <span>@@</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>symbol</span> <span>cs</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, <code>digit</code> is achieved by:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>digit</span> <span>=</span> <span>one_of</span> <span>"0123456789"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="hitting-the-boundaries">Hitting the boundaries</h3>

<p>Next, consider a parser that recognizes arbitrary integers? An integer
consists of at least one digit but we don’t know exactly how many. How can we
define a parser that captures this semantics? As a first try:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>digits</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>d</span>  <span>=</span> <span>digit</span>
    <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>ds</span> <span>=</span> <span>either</span> <span>(</span><span>digits</span> <span>()</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>d</span> <span>::</span> <span>ds</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>string_of_list</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>int_of_string</span><span>)</span> <span>@@</span> <span>digits</span> <span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can you spot the problem with the above definition? If not, just try running
it and you’ll find it throwing a <em>stack-overflow</em> exception. The problem is
that the recursive call is never conditional on any base case and is always
eagerly evaluated. We need a way to describe parsers that may consume
arbitrarily large inputs without constructing infinite parsing expressions!
To generalize from the <code>int</code> example, we’re aiming for a combinator with the
following signature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>many</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>list</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One solution would be to introduce a constructor, say <code>Delay</code>,
for representing lazy parsers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Delay</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>

<span>let</span> <span>delay</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>Delay</span> <span>f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is a parser with delayed construction. We may use <code>delay</code> to define
<code>many</code>, as in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span>  <span>=</span> <span>p</span>
    <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>delay</span> <span>@@</span> <span>fun</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>either</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, each step of the recursion is evaluated on demand rather than upfront.
This solution would work well if it weren’t for the more ambitious set of constraints
having to do with pretty printing and symbol extraction. The problem is that
in order to extract all possible symbols of a delayed parser, we’d need to evaluate
it; this would unroll the infinite recursion expressed in the <code>many</code> definition, and
once again kill the stack.</p>

<h3 id="fixing-the-parser-definition"><em>Fixing</em> the parser definition</h3>

<p>Is there any fix for the problem of simultaneously having a finite
traversable representation, and providing sufficient expressive power for
describing infinite parsers? The clue is in the question. A way of expressing
recursive structures without recursion is exactly what is offered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator">fixed-point
combinator</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s extend the parser type with a fixed-point constructor (and also get rid of <code>Delay</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Fix</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>

<span>let</span> <span>fix</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fix</span> <span>f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then use <code>fix</code> as a remedy for the recursiveness of the definition of <code>many</code>,
from above:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>fix</span> <span>@@</span> <span>fun</span> <span>many</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span>  <span>=</span> <span>p</span>
      <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>many</span> <span>in</span>
      <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span>
    <span>in</span>
    <span>either</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that there is <em>no</em> <code>rec</code> keyword in sight. The function <code>fix</code> is just a
handy tool for allowing us to mimic recursive functions. You may be left
wondering how exactly this solves the problem of symbol extraction, given
that we still end up with <code>Fix</code> nodes – functions of type <code>('a t -&gt; 'a t)</code>
– that need to be evaluated. Hopefully, the next sections on interpreting
parsers will bring some clarity on that matter.</p>

<p>Coming back to the example of integer-parsing, here’s how <code>int</code> may be defined
in terms of <code>many</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>d</span>  <span>=</span> <span>digit</span>
  <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>ds</span> <span>=</span> <span>many</span> <span>digit</span> <span>in</span>
  <span>int_of_string</span> <span>@@</span> <span>string_of_list</span> <span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>::</span> <span>ds</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, we may extract the common pattern of parsing one or more times using the same
parser (one or more digits in the example above) by adding a new combinator, as in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given a parser <code>p</code>, the parser <code>many p</code> succeeds if it can apply <code>p</code> <em>at least</em> one
time on its input.</p>

<p>As a side note, the code generously makes use of the new applicative syntax to
demonstrate how it may be used to write declarative code that also avoids
infix operators. As an alternative, we can define the same functions
without relying on the syntax extension; for instance:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(* Requires Ops module to be open *)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>fix</span> <span>@@</span> <span>fun</span> <span>many</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>either</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span><span>.</span><span>cons</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>many</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>cons</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>many</span>…</code></pre></div></div></section></div>

      <p>Someone was silly enough to upload a
<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6461d0988c835e91eb534757a9fa3ab35afe010bec7d5406d4dfb30ea767a62c">working spectre (CVE-2017-5753) exploit</a>
for Linux (there is also a
<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ecc0f2aa29b102bf8d67b7d7173e8698c0341ddfdf9757be17595460fbf1791a">Windows one</a> with symbols that I didn't look at.)
on VirusTotal last month, so here is my quick Sunday afternoon lazy analysis.</p>
<p>The binary has its <code>-h</code> option stripped, likely behind a <code>#define</code> to avoid
detection, but some of its parameters are obvious, like specifying
what file to leak, or the kernel base address. The authors didn't check (or care)
that the logging function hasn't been entirely optimized out, leaving a bunch
of strings helping in the reversing process.</p>
<p>The exploit works in four stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the <a href="https://www.halolinux.us/kernel-reference/inode-objects.html">superblock</a>,</li>
<li>Find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode">inode</a> of the file to dump</li>
<li>Find the corresponding page address</li>
<li>Dumps the content of the file.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of <code>/etc/shadow</code>, the default option, the content of the
file is shoved in memory by running the following command in the
background: <code>return system("echo \"whatever\n\" | su - 2&gt; /dev/null")</code>.
In my lab, on a vulnerable Fedora, the exploit is successfully dumping <code>/etc/shadow</code> in a couple of minutes.
Interestingly, there are checks to detect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor_Mode_Access_Prevention">SMAP</a>
and abort if it's present. I didn't manage to understand why the exploit was
failing in its presence.</p>
<p>The crux of the exploit is at <code>0x4092f0</code>, using <code>cpuid</code> as a serializing
instruction, <code>rdtsc</code> for timing, and <code>mfence</code>/<code>lfence</code> as barrier, as
documented in the paper. It's also using some tricks to minimize the amount of
readings, like type-specific functions, for example a kernel address has a
specific <em>format</em>.
Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec">spender</a> for confirming that the gadget used is likely <code>get_user()</code> in the <code>FIOASYNC ioctl</code>,
which was <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/kernel-hardening/patch/20180209133935.811950747@linuxfoundation.org/">fixed in 2018</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KASLR">KASLR</a> is bypassed when present either by
looking at <code>/proc/kallsyms</code> when available to unprivileged users like it used
to be the case on Fedora until ~recently, or by using the generic
bypass from the <a href="https://gruss.cc/files/prefetch.pdf">prefetch side-channel</a> by Gruss and al.
originating from a library called <code>libkaslr</code>. Amusingly, this method is still
working on an up to date Linux, proving again that <a href="https://grsecurity.net/kaslr_an_exercise_in_cargo_cult_security">KASLR is useless at
best</a>.
For systems that don't have the <code>/proc/kallsym</code> file accessible, the exploit
relies on hardcoded offsets, and while only Fedora, ArchLinux and Ubuntu are currently
supported, there are functions to check for Debian and CentOS. It's a bit
surprising to see hardcoded offsets in an exploit with arbitrary read in
2021.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it had a

rate before I published this blogpost.</p>
<p>Attribution is trivial and left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

    <p>If you’re reading this, I’m pretty sure you’ve seen the following pattern over and over again:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creative nonfiction pioneer John McPhee distilled decades of experience and first-hand learnings in a series of essays. (The best of them are now available in a book called “Draft No. 4”.)</li>
  <li>A savvy entrepreneur repackages the advice in a $1000+ cohort-based course.</li>
  <li>Someone takes the course and summarizes what he learned.</li>
  <li>People on Twitter start creating threads summarizing the student’s summaries.</li>
  <li>At some point, the guy who summarized the student’s summaries will get invited to a podcast to summarize his summary of the student’s summary.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish I was kidding.</p>

<p>This is a picture-perfect example of what Sean Blanda calls the <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55974/the-creative-worlds-bullshit-industrial-complex">Creative World’s Bullshit Industrial Complex</a>. But my goal here is not to dunk on anyone. Instead I want to focus on something far more important.</p>

<p>The Bullshit Complex is just a symptom. What’s the underlying cause?</p>

<p>First, let me clarify one thing. While I’m convinced that remixed content is largely a waste of time for writers and readers, it’s a free world out there. Do whatever makes you happy. If you focus on remixed or “curated” content I’ll probably not follow you on Twitter or read your blog, but there’s no reason why you should care about that. Ultimately, it’s your own responsibility to decide how you spend your time and what kind of content you consume.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s talk about entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>In recent years one of the most common pieces of advice for aspiring entrepreneurs has become that you should focus on building an audience. Everyone is screaming it from the rooftops.</p>

<p>So when I started to get into entrepreneurship a few months ago, that’s exactly what I did. I spent a lot of time researching what kind of tweets get attention and set the goal for myself to post at least two tweets per week and two blog posts per month. After all, churning out content regularly is key if you want to build an audience, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=67&amp;v=cubPiuD7_dA&amp;feature=youtu.be">right</a>?</p>

<p>If you need any evidence how serious I was about the whole building an audience thing, here it is: I created a <a href="https://whattotweet.com/">What to Tweet</a> tool because I was struggling to stick to my Twitter schedule.</p>

<p>Looking back at it now I think I largely wasted my time. And more importantly I see so many people falling into the exact same trap.</p>

<p>Their goal is to become entrepreneurs. But instead of building products, they create content. Or even worse, they do research and take courses on how to create content.</p>

<p>But this doesn’t bring them one inch closer to their goal. It’s just a form of procrastination.</p>

<p>While charging money for something you created is <a href="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/free">scary</a>, there is almost zero risk in putting out free content. And if you’re just remixing other people’s content, the intellectual risk is effectively zero. After all, you can always reply “hey, don’t shoot the messenger”.</p>

<p>This trap is particularly dangerous because it feels like you’re making progress while really you don’t.</p>

<p>Aspiring entrepreneurs are not just wasting a lot of time but also lots of money this way. They spend thousands of dollars on courses that teach them how to remix other people’s content more effectively. They buy the latest hyped-up courses that teach them how to craft more effective tweets, blog posts and Youtube videos.</p>

<p>But don’t get me wrong. <em>Having</em> an audience is awesome and I love great content.</p>

<p>What I’m saying is that too many beginners have their priorities backwards and fall into the “build an audience!” trap.</p>

<p>An exemplary plan looks as follows: “I don’t know what product I should create. So I’m planning to create articles or carousels on Linkedin to find my voice and build an audience.” That’s almost verbatim a paragraph from an email I received two days ago.</p>

<p>You can certainly get a lot of followers by churning out remixed content and feel-good platitudes. But everyone seems to forget that not all audiences are alike.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have 2000 followers that you got by posting feel-good platitudes, whereas I only have two followers called Elon Musk and Paul Graham. Would you swap accounts?</p>

<p>With feel-good platitudes and remixed content you’ll only attract fellow beginners. Everyone else recognizes the content immediately for what it is. Hence, the primary value of your much larger audience is that you’re able to sell them a “How to grow your Twitter following” Gumroad course for $47.</p>

<p>A high-quality audience is an endless source of opportunities. A low quality one is at most a Ponzi scheme.</p>

<p>Many people <a href="https://twitter.com/m_ashcroft/status/1364334719970721793">learn</a> this the hard way. They get lured by the promise that they’ll be able to create content effortlessly and build an audience this way. This is exactly what beginners want to hear and hence what gurus are preaching. “Everything is a remix”. So just progressively summarize a bunch of books and then start sharing pieces you remixed from your summaries.</p>

<p>Students of these courses spent months recording videos and writing thousands of words only to discover that they never said anything meaningful.</p>

<p>Valuable content that truly advances the conversation and gets the attention of people you really want to connect with is never effortless. It’s painful. And I’m not talking about some kind of sophisticated editing process, but the writing itself.</p>

<p>In fact, this is how you know that you’re creating valuable content. You should at least be a little scared before you hit the publish button.</p>

<p>Publishing content online is the best way to become visible so that opportunities can find you. But please don’t try to improve your ability to come up with interesting things by reading and connecting ideas just so that you have something to write about.</p>

<p>If you ever notice that you’re trying to “say something interesting”, stop. You’re just going to feed the Creative World’s Bullshit Industrial Complex.</p>

<p>Your main priority always should be to <em>do</em> meaningful things, to solve real-world problems, to be the man in the arena. And if you share what you learn along the way, people will start to listen. Write when you have something meaningful to say, and not to stick to some self-imposed writing schedule.</p>

<p>A hidden benefit of this strategy is that your writing skills become largely irrelevant. It’s certainly true that great writers like John McPhee can make a topic as boring as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54983.Oranges">Oranges</a> exciting. But if you have a great story to tell or learned something important, people will pay attention no matter how bad your writing is. Not convinced? Just look at the essay you’re reading right now.</p>

<p>Save yourself thousands of dollars. Here’s all the writing advice you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share meaningful first-hand experiences.</li>
  <li>Write as if you were emailing a friend, not to impress an imaginary teacher.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I’m definitely scared to publish this essay. This is exactly why I’ll do it.</p>

		<p>Some books are like mirrors. By that I mean that reading them involves a great deal of looking at oneself, both for praise and loathing. Taking a look back in time, reflecting on all those times we thought we were right and we were wrong, bringing back memories of times long gone, some of them painful, most hopefully fun and joyful.</p>
<p>“The Psychology of Computer Programming” is one of those. In every one of its chapters, Dr. Weinberg reflects on the human aspects of programming. It is, most probably, the first book ever written on the subject of the personality, the interactions and the characteristics of software developers. Let me be clear: this book has been written in 1971, and it has been continuously in print until at least the end of the twentieth century, for almost 30 years. This is the stuff of classics.</p>
<p>There has even been a reviewed “anniversary” edition published in 1999, but I bought a copy of the first edition of the book, and besides the delightful look and feel of the pages, representatives of the typography and design of the seventies, the structure, the flow and the discussion of this book make it stand in a class of its own, and represent a hallmark in our field.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Weinberg analyzes programming from both individual and collective points of view, including the issues of education, human resources management, and even programming language design. The author actually devotes a section of his book to explain how the design of a programming language impacts the readability and the subsequent maintainability (or lack thereof) of the programs written in it.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>Regarding team interactions, the author highlights the issues brought from scaling up programming teams: do small teams face the same issues as larger ones? How do communication patterns emerge and evolve? The author takes pleasure in debunking common myths and misconceptions, some of them still held today by managers all over the world: what are the factors that can cause a project to break down in pieces? The answers will surprise you, and you will wonder why nobody had ever told you to read this book first.</p>
<p>Dr. Weinberg also pays close attention to the individual characteristics of programmers. What defines a good programmer? Why do they take pride in their jobs? What kind of incentives should a company offer to their developers? Nice offices or challenging problems? (I think you can guess the answer to that last question.)</p>
<p>In the humble opinion of the author of these lines, software is primarily a social process, and only later a technical feat. Software is no more a technical product than a book is just a printed object. Software is the result of interactions among people, and as such it will reflect all the contradictions, the failures, the wonders and the joy of the people involved in it. Every single piece of software ever written by humans reflects the underlying moods, psyche and interactions of a group of people. As such, studying the psychology of a programmer yields naturally in a process in which, invariably, the software will be better at the end.</p>
<p>I once saw a joke on Twitter, saying that managing programmers was subject to Heisenberg’s Principle, in that observing programmers changes their behavior. I do not think it is a joke, for I believe that all social systems are, actually, quantum-like systems subject to this principle; the actions of the observer will invariably alter the behavior of the observed. And that is OK, as far as I am concerned. If managers are conscious of this fact, and if they can use this to their advantage, they will be able to build sustainable teams.</p>
<p>Maybe Dr. Weinberg took some inspiration from Melvin Conway, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 1967 stated</a> that “organizations design systems mirroring their own communication structures”. Now you start to understand why your microservice architecture is a mess, and no, neither Istio nor Prometheus is going to help you with that.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding recruiting: we all know how hard it is to find and recruit software developers, yet I am appalled to see how many companies do as much as they can to destroy the teams they spent so much time and money to build. Why is this? I can only recommend all human resources managers, all project managers, and all developers as well, to get a copy of this book and, as I said at the beginning of this chapter, to take a good look at ourselves in the mirror. We all need a little bit of introspection, and Dr. Weinberg can help.</p>
<p>Legacy buzzword warning: this book is mostly accessible to general audiences, but there are a few sections where the author assumes a certain experience with programming languages, compilers, hardware design or even project management; and in some cases, with the 1971 versions of those.</p>

      <p><img src="https://justanman.org/images/aol-instant-messenger-shuts-down.png" alt="AOL Instant Messenger ‘Running Man’ waving goodbye"></p>
<p>In the early 2000s social media sites like Facebook and Twitter weren’t commonplace yet. Even text messages, at ten cents each, were something to be rationed. For many teenagers the primary means of communication outside school was AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). So when it was announced in October that they were shutting down AIM after 20 years, I felt a wave of nostalgia for the messaging app of my youth.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear when they would be pulling the plug for good, but a high school friend and I planned to be online for the occasion. Their website indicated that AIM would continue to work until the morning of December 15, 2017. Assuming this meant UTC time, that put it going offline sometime after 7:00 PM EST on the 14th.</p>
<p>I wondered: Could I be the last person to sign off? The last person to send a message? Would I have anything profound to say?</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>I decided to research famous last words. First stop: the Book of Revelation. Final chapter, final verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Last words are for fools who haven’t said enough!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too cantankerous. And as a somewhat libertarian leaning person, I wasn’t going to let Karl Marx have the last word.</p>
<p>I’d figure out what to say later and in the meantime started reading about the technology behind AIM. I learned about OSCAR, the proprietary protocol used by AIM and ICQ. Parts of the protocol were documented by AOL in an official SDK. This is what made third-party AIM clients possible. I had used Gaim (now Pidgin) on Linux machines before and indeed, there was even BSFlite, an AIM client for the command line.</p>
<p>AOL’s desktop client no longer worked for me. They had already pulled the iOS app from the App Store. Ditto for Android. Fortunately browser sign on still worked. I was greeted by a familiar interface that supported new features like embedded media and SMS.</p>
<p>I sent a couple test messages from the browser to my phone. Monitoring outbound activity in the Chrome network panel revealed the structure of a request: a simple HTTP POST to a url, with what appeared to be a session ID in the query string and a message body. I tried to send a message using <code>curl</code> and it worked. As long as I was signed on in the browser the request was accepted.</p>
<p>There were several paths to automating this but given the time constraint, something quick and easy would probably suffice. All I had to do was keep sending messages until the server stopped responding.</p>
<p><strong>December 14, 2017: The final countdown</strong></p>
<p>It was almost midnight UTC time. It would be the 15th soon and I didn’t want to miss the shutdown, so I set up a Bash script to run the <code>curl</code> command at one second intervals. Every now and then I had to manually reauthenticate in the browser. It wasn’t elegant but it worked. Now I had to wait…</p>
<p>To pass time I searched Twitter for mentions of AIM’s last day. Plenty of people were reminiscing about their old screen names, but only a handful were actually signing on one last time. I added them to my buddy list and we talked for a bit. One lived in DC, one in Toledo. Another somewhere in Maryland. Two were engineers, one was a wrestling announcer! I made dinner and watched <em>The Office</em> while occasionally checking on the script.</p>
<p>It ran for another six hours until 1:21 AM EST. I witnessed the drama play out in HTTP status codes:</p>
<pre><code>200 OK
200 OK
200 OK
408 Request Timeout
408 Request Timeout
401 Unauthorized
</code></pre><p>And like that, AIM was gone. Requests to aim.com returned an Invalid URL status page. <code>curl</code> returned nothing but 401s.</p>
<p><strong>Epitaph</strong></p>
<p>I examined the script logs and found it – the last message sent on AIM. [1] It was timestamped Fri Dec 15 01:21:42 EST 2017. From me, to me. (I didn’t want to spam anyone.)</p>
<p>I had borrowed the words from Leonard Nimoy’s final tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🖖</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>[1] At least in my server region.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few days ago I realized something. I don’t like writing.</p><p>I realized it because I found creative energy to work on programming projects again, and I experience writing programs differently from how I experience having to write. Even the turn of phrase “having to write” betrays my disposition toward the craft.</p><p>When I’m very excited to build products or just program computers for the joy of programming, I dread going to sleep and every part of me <em>cannot wait</em> to wake up and write code again. I’ve never felt that about writing. Writing has always been a chore. I think I’ve known this all along, but have never been able to admit this to myself until now.</p><p>When you read anything about anything anywhere, it tells you what great [INSERT CALLING HERE] do. Great startup founders and engineers write well and write a lot because without clear writing there is no clear thinking. I think I bought into that too much for my own good. So it feels liberating to say: <strong>I hate writing.</strong> It’s painful and laborious and every good piece of writing I make feels like delivering a baby. A rewarding experience for sure, but I think even the most loving of mothers would stop being so loving if she had to deliver a new baby every week.</p><p>One thing that duped me is a lot of positive reenforcement. My best pieces of writing get tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of readers, and that gives me an addicting sense of elation. I certainly never expected to make money doing it, but enough of you find my writing sufficiently interesting to offer the ultimate seal of approval— you transfer money from your wallet into mine. I deeply appreciate it, and deeply appreciate you spending time on reading my essays, but unfortunately this isn’t sufficient impetus for me to produce good work. When I’m forced to write on a schedule, my writing sucks and my life is miserable.</p><p>Which is a good reminder why some of my writing is good. It’s good when I have something important to say. Important things are hard to say by definition— if they were easy people would have already talked them out and they probably would have lost their importance. At least they’re hard to say for me. So when I do it it’s always very slow and painful, and it turns out good because I say something that matters to me in a way that nobody else bothered or managed to say. With my particular idiosyncrasies the intersection of that and the business of running a newsletter is an empty set.</p><p>So please stop paying me. For the folks that have prepaid, I’m not exactly sure how Substack tooling handles this situation, but shoot me an email and I’ll figure out how to return a prorated amount.</p><p>I will continue writing. When I have something important to say, I’ll go through the pain necessary for me to say it. I’ll also write about my observations as I pursue my product and programming work— technical, anthropological, and simply keeping you up to do date on what I’m up to. I don’t expect you’ll be hearing from me less often. In fact, I’m hoping this will allow me to write more. But owing people weekly essays as a matter of business isn’t my tao. For all the reasons above, and primarily because it makes the essays suck, and I don’t like producing bad work.</p><p>Until next week, hopefully. Slava.</p></div></div>]]>
