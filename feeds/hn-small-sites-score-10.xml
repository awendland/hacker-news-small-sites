    <p>Recent events have made me reflect on a few things in my life I was already thinking about for a while. Also, responses on social media have made me realize that people have <em>strange</em> expectations from me, and what my role in the Bitcoin Core project is.</p>

<h2 id="growth">growth</h2>

<p>Bitcoin has grown a lot since I started contributing to it in 2011. Some arrangements that were acceptable for a small scale FOSS project are no longer so for one runing a 600 billion dollar system. Market cap is famously deceptive, but my point is not about specific numbers here.</p>

<p>One thing is clear: this is a serious project now, and we need to start taking decentralization seriously.</p>

<h2 id="moving-on">moving on</h2>

<p>I realize I am myself somewhat of a centralized bottleneck. And although I find Bitcoin an extremely interesting project and believe it’s one of the most important things happening at the moment, I also have many other interests. It’s also particularly stressful and I don’t want it, nor the bizarre spats in the social media around it, to start defining me as a person.</p>

<h2 id="spreading-out">spreading out</h2>

<p>I will start by delegating my own tasks, and decreasing my involvement. I do not intend to stop contributing to Bitcoin, or even to the Bitcoin Core project, but I would like to remove myself from the critical path and take (even more) of a background role.</p>

<p>Note that we had a nice growth in development activity, and that maintenance of the code itself has already been spread over multiple people for a while. I’m not the most active maintainer. Looking at the number of git merges</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoin<span>$ </span>git log <span>--pretty</span><span>=</span><span>"format:%cn"</span> <span>--merges</span> <span>--since</span><span>=</span>2020-01-01 | <span>sort</span>| <span>uniq</span> <span>-c</span>

    727 MarcoFalke
      7 Pieter Wuille
     65 Samuel Dobson
    363 Wladimir J. van der Laan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Only about 24% of the merges were done by me, last year.</p>

<h2 id="plans">plans</h2>

<p>But there’s plenty of things left to figure out, from the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize distribution.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In the short run, transfer bitcoincore.org to an organization instead of private ownership. Reduce the “bus factor”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I think it would be good if some other organizations set up mirrors, so there is less incentive to try to take bitcoincore.org down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the long run, move away from a website for code distribution completely. No matter who owns it, a website on the clearnet can be shut down with the press of a button, and it seems that the global internet is gearing up to make censorship increasingly easy. We need a decentralized web. For us, one option would be IPFS, which is starting to catch on. For the binaries themselves there’s already the option of downloading through torrents.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the release process, and release signing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Delegate more parts of the release process. Other maintainers should be able to do a release without my involvement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rename the GPG key used to sign <code>SHA256SUMS.asc</code> to “Bitcoin Core release signing key”, instead of having it in my personal title. Make some construct so that N of M (minimally) trusted gitian signers doing a succesful build automatically results in a signed distribution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Same for the native code signing for Windows and MacOS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even better in the long run would be to split up the keys, e.g. though RSA threshold signing, so that the whole process is geographically distributed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the development hub.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It’s not clear whether github can be trusted to act in our interest in the long run. Although issues and PRs are backed up through the API, having to move somewhere else could give significant interruption in development. And hopping from provider to provider would be awful—ideally the whole thing would not rely on a central server <em>at all</em>. For this I’ve been watching the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">radicle</a> project, a P2P distributed code collaboration platform. It’s not quite there yet, but seems promising.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin is quite different in some of the requirements here from other FOSS projects, so we’ll have to develop some tools as we go. We could also, definitely, use some help here.</p>

<p>Some smaller things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find someone else who wants to do the IRC meeting chair instead of me. Or maybe rotate it between multiple people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Release (and release candidate) mails to the <code>bitcoin-dev</code> and <code>bitcoin-core-dev</code> lists will no longer be necessarily signed and sent by me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s some development specific tooling hosted by me (e.g. the PR notification bots on IRC and mastodon). As they are non-critical and only little time goes into maintaining them, I’m fine with this for now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As for decentralizing Bitcoin’s node software itself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carl Dong’s <code>libbitcoin_kernel</code> work. Bitcoin Core is a large monolithic project which includes the consensus code, which is much more critical than the other parts. The kernel would be an isolated part with well-defined interface, and at some point, its own review flow for changes. The difference with previous <code>libbitcoin_consensus</code> plans is that the kernel is stateful: it includes UTXO management and validation. It however does not include P2P, mempool policy, wallet, GUI, and RPC code. It could be re-used in different clients, to have more diversity in clients, but without the risks of a deviating consensus implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of 2021 this will be my focus with regard to Bitcoin Core.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      SymQEMU: Compilation-based symbolic execution for binaries
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the Network and Distributed System Symposium (NDSS 2021),
    San Diego, CA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software analysis and bug
      detection. Compilation-based symbolic execution is a recently proposed
      flavor that has been shown to improve the performance of symbolic
      execution significantly when source code is available. We demonstrate a
      novel technique to enable compilation-based symbolic execution of binaries
      (i.e., without the need for source code). Our system, SymQEMU, builds on
      top of QEMU, modifying the intermediate representation of the target
      program before translating it to the host architecture. This enables
      SymQEMU to compile symbolic-execution capabilities into binaries and reap
      the associated performance benefits while maintaining architecture
      independence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We present our approach and implementation, and we show that it
      outperforms the state-of-the-art binary symbolic executors S2E and QSYM
      with statistical significance; on some benchmarks, it even achieves better
      performance than the source-based SymCC. Moreover, our tool has found a
      previously unknown vulnerability in the well-tested libarchive library,
      demonstrating its utility in testing real-world software.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is a fast symbolic execution engine for binaries. On this page, we
    provide its source code, the raw results of the experiments described in the
    paper, and instructions how you can replicate those experiments yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symqemu">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe three sets of experiments: we first benchmark
    SymQEMU with Google FuzzBench, then we run it on real-world software, and
    finally we perform a benchmark comparison during concolic execution of fixed
    paths. This section describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides
    links to our results.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        FuzzBench (see the <a href="http://s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/2020-05-24-symqemu.zip">report</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We will share our integration scripts shortly; they're being cleaned up
        to obtain SymQEMU and its dependencies from the new public repository.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        For the analysis of real-world software we used the same setup as in the
        <a href="http://s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/symcc.html">evaluation of SymCC</a>. The binaries for SymQEMU,
        QSYM and S2E were plain builds without any instrumentation. SymQEMU was
        run via SymCC's fuzzing helper by prefixing the target command
        with <tt>/path/to/symqemu-x86_64</tt>. For the S2E analysis, we created
        a default project, then enabled the <tt>FunctionModels</tt> plugin and
        activated the option <tt>generateOnStateFork</tt> in
        the <tt>TestCaseGenerator</tt> plugin; coverage was evaluated
        with <tt>afl-showmap</tt> at the end of the analysis, using the same
        AFL-instrumented binaries as with the hybrid fuzzers.

      </p>

      <p>
        After the analysis of real-world software described above, we randomly
        collected 1,000 generated test cases per open-source target. We ran
        SymQEMU, QSYM and SymCC on each of those inputs, recording the time
        spent in execution and SMT solving, respectively, as per the logging
        output from the QSYM backend.

<p><span title="G">G</span>lance at <em>Prime Minister</em>’s game board and player mats, and the first thing you’ll notice are all the numbers. The most important one is 330: the number of seats you need for a majority in the House of Commons. In this article, we’ll take a look at <em>Prime Minister</em>’s numerical side, with a focus on its measurement of public opinion.</p>



<p>At the heart of the game is an analog computer simulating the Victorian-era British political system. It tracks and links about 30 different political factors, including Parliament’s confidence in each player, each party’s popular support in eight key sectors of the electorate, current election projections, the number of government MPs and their “moderate” or “partisan” inclinations, projected votes on the government’s bills, the “uncertainty” factor in elections and Parliamentary votes, and Queen Victoria’s support for different players. By reducing these factors to numerical values and structuring their relationships, this analog computer decides who gets to lead each party, which party controls the government, and what bills the government can pass. Whoever does the best job of manipulating the factors controls the system and gets an edge in the game.</p>



<div><figure><a href="http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="977" height="550" src="http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1.png 977w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-300x169.png 300w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-768x432.png 768w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-760x428.png 760w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-518x292.png 518w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-82x46.png 82w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Here you can see a partial snapshot of <em>Prime Minister</em>’s game board, showing the most detailed part of its analog computer: the eight key sectors of the electorate. They include a mix of geographic, social, and ideological groups: Conservatives, Farmers, the Gentry, Ireland, Liberals, the Middle Class, Scotland, and Workers. You’ll track support for each party in each sector, moving wooden markers up and down the numerical tracks. The side with the blue rosette tracks support for the Conservative Party, and the side with the orange rosette does the same for the Liberal Party. The green circles indicate each party’s starting position in the game’s standard setup. During the game, you’ll encounter icons from bills, events, and actions that tell you when to move the markers up and down a track. By moving a marker up one step, you earn one to three popularity points, depending on the sector and your current position. The popularity points that each party earns in the different sectors are added up, and the total relative point difference between the parties determines projections for the next election.</p>



<p>The eight sectors overlap so that one voter might belong to several different sectors at once. For example, a landowner in Scotland might belong to the Conservatives, Gentry, Farmer, and Scotland sectors. The Conservative Party might win his vote by appealing to his ideological identity as a Conservative, or the Liberal Party might win his vote by appealing to his geographic Scots identity. A sector’s significance in each election varies depending on the parties’ respective strategies. If both parties neglect Farmers, then Farmers will have no significance. But if the Conservative Party maxes out its popularity among Farmers while the Liberal Party earns nothing there, the Farmers sector will weigh heavily in the next election–not only because Farmers prefer the Conservative Party, but because they have been motivated to vote according to their economic interests.</p>



<p>Different sectors have different point spreads, reflecting their importance in the Victorian-era electorate. In this era, most British subjects didn’t have the right to vote, so the point spreads aren’t simply based on population distribution. They’re based on the number of voters and each sector’s overall impact on the election results, factoring in the value of campaign contributions, endorsements, and other means of influence. This is why the Gentry sector has more points than Workers, despite being a much smaller slice of the population.</p>



<p>As the game progresses, parties will reach maximum or minimum values in some sectors. These maximums and minimums affect the game’s strategy and evoke real-life political effects. No matter how strongly Scotland prefers one party over another, Scotland’s impact is limited by the number of voters in Scotland. Once the Conservative Party has maxed out its popularity in Scotland, it can gain nothing more there; it must look for additional points in other sectors while being careful not to rock the boat in Scotland. Conversely, once the Conservative Party has bottomed out in Ireland, it has nothing more to lose there and incurs no further penalty for continuing to neglect the Irish–a circumstance which may become useful. As in real life, the parties and politicians in <em>Prime Minister </em>can’t please everyone all the time. When faced with hard choices, they favor their political patrons and write off sectors that are unimportant to them. If there’s a rail disaster in Scotland, a Conservative Prime Minister (PM) will be forced to deal with it if he wants to retain his party’s support there. But if a problem surfaces in Ireland, the same PM might choose to ignore it and focus on something else, knowing that his party can’t do any worse in Ireland.</p>



<p>In addition to tracking popular support, the sectors also track the public’s mood for partisanship, which in turn can result in “partisan” MPs who support more radical bills. The game board measures public partisanship through “red points” that are printed side-by-side next to the total points for some sectors. Not every sector produces red points. For example, the Middle Class–not known for favoring radicalism–doesn’t generate any red points. At the other end of the spectrum, the ideological sectors (Conservatives and Liberals) produce only red points. Red points are always party-specific. If a sector offers red points, it offers them to one party only. By appealing to Workers, the Liberal Party can earn up to 7 red points, reflecting the support of radical Workers who favor partisan Liberal MPs. The Conservative Party can also earn popularity points in the Workers sector, but can’t earn any red points there because Workers who support the Conservative Party prefer moderate MPs.</p>



<p>Each sector has its own flavor and strategic impact. Both parties are free to pursue popularity in any sector–the Conservative Party may pursue a limited number of points in the Liberals sector, for example–but some sectors have a natural affinity or resistance to a particular party. In pursuing popular support in the different sectors, players have to think not only about the raw number of points they earn, but also the difficulty of holding particular sectors. Scotland has the fewest points, but it’s the most stable sector. Scotland’s interests aren’t directly implicated in the hot-button political issues of the day, so there are no bills that upset the Scots. The Middle Class is equally open to both parties and offers more points than Scotland, but is somewhat harder to hold owing to its more sensitive economic and moral preferences. Players also need to think about maintaining a coherent moderate or partisan strategy. The sectors for Conservatives and Liberals are the richest in points, making them tempting targets early in the game. But appealing to voters’ partisanship results in partisan MPs who favor divisive bills that could come back to haunt you. And if your government is equally split between moderate and partisan MPs, you may have a hard time getting them to agree on legislation.</p>



<p>In standard games, <em>Prime Minister</em>’s framework supports an open-ended format in which players strive to control government, win elections, and pass bills. Different politician abilities and about 200 unique cards ensure that no two games are the same. The same framework also supports specific scenarios that simulate historical problems, like home rule for Ireland or the repeal of the Corn Laws. Automated “Clockwork” politicians can readily function within the game’s system, opening the door to solitaire play.</p>



<p>Players have a wide variety of ways to interact with the game, starting with an action point system that allows you to perform a variable number of actions per turn. Depending on your current player mat and your politician’s fixed abilities, you can campaign to increase your party’s popularity in particular sectors, debate for or against bills, flatter Her Majesty to gain her favor, or influence MPs to make them more moderate or partisan. You can also draw “supporter” cards featuring influential Victorians who perform actions on your behalf. You’ll always have many things to do and not enough action cubes to spend, forcing you to prioritize your actions while anticipating future events. The PM’s response to random events and Parliament’s enactment of important bills have consequences that ripple through the system. The players and parties are in a constant tug of war. Collecting the right supporters, unleashing them at the right moment, and coordinating your actions with other players can help you achieve a breakthrough. But the game is not all about numbers. Relationships between players also factor heavily in the game, particularly in its 3- or 4-player mode. We’ll take a look at the players’ roles and relationships in the next <em>InsideGMT</em> article for <em>Prime Minister</em>.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Professor Drosten, the pandemic has entered a decisive phase. The beginning of the vaccination campaign has meant light at the end of the tunnel, but now, more contagious virus variants have appeared. How dangerous is the situation in Germany at the moment?</p>


<p><strong>Drosten:</strong> I am, of course, closely monitoring the situation. Politicians are also acutely aware that we have to be careful. Early on, I admit that I had my doubts as to whether B.1.1.7, the new variant from Britain, was as much more contagious as people were claiming. But now, there is a new study from Oxford, really solid data, showing that this mutation is up to 35 percent more contagious than the wild-type virus. It is rather astonishing that the virus has boosted its infectiousness to that degree. That is, unfortunately, more dangerous than if it had become more deadly – because every new case will infect more people, and each of them will infect more people, such that the number of cases will grow exponentially.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> On Monday evening, you were part of the group of experts advising Chancellor Angela Merkel and the governors of Germany's 16 states. What recommendations did you make?</p>
<p><strong>Drosten:</strong> Right now, I am most concerned about the British variant, primarily because of our geographical proximity to the UK. According to the facts we currently have, B.1.1.7 has just started spreading in Germany. I think we have the singular opportunity to prevent, or at least significantly slow, the advance of this variant. With B.1.1.7, there could be a kind of threshold effect. If we are able to keep the new variant below a critical benchmark, we would at least have hope that it wouldn't spread as quickly here.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Are the measures decreed on Tuesday sufficient?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> In the negotiations, I think there was an effort made to find the gaps, the places where not enough has thus far been undertaken to stop the spread. It's clear that it was a struggle and that the results are a compromise. Some areas appear particularly important to me. Schools and daycare centers, for one, particularly the classes in secondary schools. England has closed such schools, with the exception of children of critical workers, and I think that is also where the most reliable data is to be found. For me, this is unequivocal, and Germany should use it as an orientation.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What about the measures pertaining to working from home?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> More could certainly have been done on that issue. It would have been good to take inspiration from the Irish experience in the autumn. Ireland introduced strict measures regarding working from home, and it was apparently quite effective. Doing so automatically reduces public transport occupancy. There is also a third aspect where improvements are necessary, something the British are doing: Targeted contact and support for the socially disadvantaged and groups that are difficult to reach in the pandemic. Here, the virus frequently spreads explosively, because many people live in close quarters and have jobs that don't allow them to work from home. Many perhaps don't fully understand the problem presented by confined spaces. I think there is still a lot to do here.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> You've come up with an image to illustrate our current situation in the pandemic: We are in a rickety truck that is driving down a steep mountainside ...</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> ... and we don't know what curves are coming up and whether the road is suddenly about to get steeper. We also don't know how far we still have to go, but we do know that we absolutely have to avoid missing a corner. In a situation like this, closing our eyes doesn't help. We have to keep going and do one thing in particular: Hit the brakes, even if they might be rusty.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What do you mean by that?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> That means, we have to lower the reproduction number R.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The value that tells us the average number of people an infected person passes the virus to.</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> Precisely. Currently, that number is at 0.9. It is great that we have finally managed to push it back down below 1, so that the number of cases can begin to drop. But 0.9 isn't enough if we want to quickly loosen the brakes. With an R of 0.9, it takes about a month to reduce the number of infections by half. That is too long. We should try, through an intensification of the shutdown, to get the number down to 0.7. Then, the case numbers will drop by half in just a week, and we can get to a point where we can stop the spread of B.1.1.7 or at least give ourselves a head start.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Do you think that the so-called Zero-COVID strategy, the goal of sinking the number of new infections to zero, is the right way forward?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> I do think it would be possible with a significant effort. The virus, of course, would continue to flare up, just as we have seen in China and Australia. But it would absolutely be worthwhile to at least identify zero new infections as a target. Primarily because I am quite apprehensive about what might otherwise happen in the spring and summer.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> Once the elderly and maybe part of the risk groups have been vaccinated, there will be immense economic, social, political and perhaps also legal pressure to end the corona measures. And then, huge numbers of people will become infected within just a short amount of time, more than we can even imagine at the moment. We won't have 20,000 or 30,000 new cases a day, but up to 100,000 in a worst-case scenario. It will, of course, be primarily younger people who are less likely than older people to have severe symptoms, but when a huge number of younger people get infected, then the intensive care units will fill up anyway and a lot of people will die. Just that it will be younger people. We can cushion this terrible scenario somewhat by pushing the numbers way down now.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Can we be confident that case numbers will begin to drop in spring as temperatures rise?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> I don't think so. The fact that we had such a relaxed summer in 2020 likely had to do with the fact that our case numbers remained below a critical threshold in the spring. But that's not the case any longer. I am afraid that it will be more like in Spain, where case numbers climbed rapidly again after the lockdown was lifted, even though it was quite hot. In South Africa, too, where it is currently summer, case numbers are at a high level. (<em>Sinks into thought, saying nothing</em>) I'm sorry, unfortunately I'm extremely tired.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Because you were advising politicians deep into the night?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Drosten:</strong> (<em>laughs</em>) No. Because I worked until 1 a.m. and then woke up this morning at 5:30.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How well are you able to juggle your work with family life?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> I don't really want to talk about my private life. But I do think that it's a problem many families are facing at the moment. The pandemic has found a sore spot. In countries like Germany, where people generally aren't living together with grandma and grandpa, many families find themselves in an extremely difficult situation. I hope that we can learn from this and find new solutions.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Do you still have time for your real work, as a virologist?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> Yes, of course. We are currently taking a closer look at the British variant. We hope to have initial results in a few weeks.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Which of the new mutants do you believe is the most dangerous?</p>

<p><strong>Drosten:</strong> In a population that still isn't immune, like here in Germany, the variant from Britain will likely find success, because it is better at spreading, it is more contagious. The South African and Brazilian variants may be able to infect people who have already had the disease, but that likely doesn't give them an advantage in a population where immunity isn't yet widespread. Which means that the virus will be distributed here and there over the course of the next year, and new variants will surely appear.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What does that mean for the vaccines?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> One of the mutations in the Brazilian and South African variants has already demonstrated a serious immune escape ...</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> ... which helps the virus evade our immune defenses. Does that mean that the vaccines will be ineffective?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> Antibodies are just one component of immune protection, another is T-cell immunity. That protects much more strongly against a serious progression of the illness. If the virus mutates, it doesn't have an effect on T-cell immunity. As such, I don't think that we have to fear that our vaccines will be ineffective.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> When you formulate such assessments, people across Germany are listening, and it often determines public opinion. How well are you able to live with that responsibility?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> It doesn't rob me of sleep. From the very beginning, I hoped that this public role would be shared among several people. And luckily, that is happening.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Last year, experts who have argued time and again against scientifically proven measures – e.g. Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit and Hendrik Streeck – likely did more damage than corona-truthers. Protecting high-risk groups must have priority, you frequently heard from their group. Yet it has long-since been clear that doing so is impossible when case numbers are high. At what point do you lose your patience?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> Are you trying to get me to criticize colleagues by name? I don't think much of personal attacks.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> We are more interested in a fundamental point. Many such experts awaken the impression that only opinions are important in science, and not evidence. That undermines the credibility of researchers who take a more serious approach. How do you deal with that?</p><p><strong>Drosten:</strong> Like most scientists, …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p><span>May 12, 2014</span>
</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>There was an argument on Tumblr which, like so many arguments on Tumblr, was terrible. I will rephrase it just a little to make a point.
</p>
<p>Alice said something along the lines of “I hate people who frivolously diagnose themselves with autism without knowing anything about the disorder. They should stop thinking they’re ‘so speshul’ and go see a competent doctor.”
</p>
<p>Beth answered something along the lines of “I diagnosed myself with autism, but only after a lot of careful research. I don’t have the opportunity to go see a doctor. I think what you’re saying is overly strict and hurtful to many people with autism.”
</p>
<p>Alice then proceeded to tell Beth she disagreed, in that special way only Tumblr users can. I believe the word “cunt” was used.
</p>
<p>I notice two things about the exchange.
</p>
<p>First, why did Beth take the bait? Alice said she hated people who <em>frivolously</em> self-diagnosed <em>without knowing anything about the disorder</em>. Beth clearly was not such a person. Why didn’t she just say “Yes, please continue hating these hypothetical bad people who are not me”?
</p>
<p>Second, why did <em>Alice</em> take the bait? Why didn’t she just say “I think you’ll find I wasn’t talking about you?”
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>One of the cutting-edge advances in fallacy-ology has been the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-duped/" rel="nofollow">weak man</a>, a terribly-named cousin of the straw man. The straw man is a terrible argument nobody really holds, which was only invented so your side had something easy to defeat. The weak man is a terrible argument that only a few unrepresentative people hold, which was only <em>brought to prominence</em> so your side had something easy to defeat.
</p>
<p>For example, “I am a proud atheist and I don’t like religion. Think of the terrible things done by religion, like the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church. They try to disturb the funerals of heroes because they think God hates everybody. But this is horrible. Religious people can’t justify why they do things like this. That’s why I’m proud to be an atheist.”
</p>
<p>It’s not a straw man. There really is a Westboro Baptist Church, for some reason. But one still feels like the atheist is making things just a little too easy on himself.
</p>
<p>Maybe the problem is that the atheist is indirectly suggesting that Westboro Baptist Church is typical of religion? An implied falsehood?
</p>
<p>Then suppose the atheist posts on Tumblr: “I hate religious people who are rabidly certain that the world was created in seven days or that all their enemies will burn in Hell, and try to justify it through ‘faith’. You know, the sort of people who think that the Bible has all the answers and who hate anyone who tries to think for themselves.”
</p>
<p>Now there’s practically no implication that these people are typical. So that’s fine, right?
</p>
<p>On the other side of the world, a religious person is writing “I hate atheists who think morality is relative, and that this gives them the right to murder however many people stand between them and a world where no one is allowed to believe in God”.
</p>
<p>Again, not a straw man. The Soviet Union contained several million of these people. But if you’re an atheist, would you just let this pass?
</p>
<p>How about “I hate black thugs who rob people”?
</p>
<p>What are the chances a black guy reads that and says “Well, good thing I’m not a thug who robs people, he’ll probably <em>love</em> me”?
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>What is the problem with statements like this?
</p>
<p>First, they are meant to re-center a category. Remember, people think in terms of categories with central and noncentral members – a sparrow is a central bird, an ostrich a noncentral one. But if you live on the Ostrich World, which is inhabited only by ostriches, emus, and cassowaries, then probably an ostrich seems like a pretty central example of ‘bird’ and the first sparrow you see will be fantastically strange.
</p>
<p>Right now most people’s central examples of religion are probably things like your local neighborhood church. If you’re American, it’s probably a bland Protestant denomination like the Episcopalians or something.
</p>
<p>The guy whose central examples of religion are Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama is probably going to have a different perception of religion than the guy whose central examples are Torquemada and Fred Phelps. If you convert someone from the first kind of person to the second kind of person, you’ve gone most of the way to making them an atheist.
</p>
<p>More important, if you convert a culture from thinking in the first type of way to thinking in the second type of way, then religious people will be unpopular and anyone trying to make a religious argument will have to spend the first five minutes of their speech explaining how they’re not Fred Phelps, honest, and no, they don’t picket any funerals. After all that time spent apologizing and defending themselves and distancing themselves from other religious people, they’re not likely to be able to make a very rousing argument for religion.
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/" rel="nofollow">Cowpox of Doubt</a>, I mention the inoculation effect. When people see a terrible argument for an idea get defeated, they are more likely to doubt the idea later on, even if much better arguments show up.
</p>
<p>Put this in the context of people attacking the Westboro Baptist Church. You see the attacker win a big victory over “religion”, broadly defined. Now you are less likely to believe in religion when a much more convincing one comes along.
</p>
<p>I see the same thing in atheists’ odd fascination with creationism. Most of the religious people one encounters are not young-earth creationists. But these people have a dramatic hold on the atheist imagination.
</p>
<p>And I think: well, maybe if people see atheists defeating a terrible argument for religion enough, atheists don’t <em>have to</em> defeat any of the others. People have already been inoculated against religion. “Oh, yeah, that was the thing with the creationism. Doesn’t seem very smart.”
</p>
<p>If this is true, it means that all religious people, like it or not, are in the same boat. An atheist attacking creationism becomes a deadly threat for the average Christian, even if that Christian does not herself believe in creationism.
</p>
<p>Likewise, when a religious person attacks atheists who are moral relativists, or communists, or murderers, then all atheists have to band together to stop it somehow or they will have successfully poisoned people against atheism.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>This is starting to sound a lot like <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/329171.html" rel="nofollow">something I wrote on my old blog about superweapons</a>.
</p>
<p>I suggested imagining yourself in the shoes of a Jew in czarist Russia. The big news story is about a Jewish man who killed a Christian child. As far as you can tell the story is true. It’s just disappointing that everyone who tells it is describing it as “A Jew killed a Christian kid today”. You don’t want to make a big deal over this, because no one is saying anything objectionable like “And so all Jews are evil”. Besides you’d hate to inject identity politics into this obvious tragedy. It just sort of makes you uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>The next day you hear that the local priest is giving a sermon on how the Jews killed Christ. This statement seems historically plausible, and it’s part of the Christian religion, and no one is implying it says anything about the Jews today. You’d hate to be the guy who barges in and tries to tell the Christians what Biblical facts they can and can’t include in their sermons just because they offend you. It would make you an annoying busybody. So again you just get uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>The next day you hear people complain about the greedy Jewish bankers who are ruining the world economy. And really a disproportionate number of bankers are Jewish, and bankers really do seem to be the source of a lot of economic problems. It seems kind of pedantic to interrupt every conversation with “But also some bankers are Christian, or Muslim, and even though a disproportionate number of bankers are Jewish that doesn’t mean the Jewish bankers are disproportionately active in ruining the world economy compared to their numbers.” So again you stay uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>Then the next day you hear people complain about Israeli atrocities in Palestine (what, you thought this was past czarist Russia? This is future czarist Russia, after Putin finally gets the guts to crown himself). You understand that the Israelis really do commit some terrible acts. On the other hand, when people start talking about “Jewish atrocities” and “the need to protect Gentiles from Jewish rapacity” and “laws to stop all this horrible stuff the Jews are doing”, you just feel worried, even though you personally are not doing any horrible stuff and maybe they even have good reasons for phrasing it that way.
</p>
<p>Then the next day you get in a business dispute with your neighbor. Maybe you loaned him some money and he doesn’t feel like paying you back. He tells you you’d better just give up, admit he is in the right, and apologize to him – because if the conflict escalated everyone would take his side because he is a Christian and you are a Jew. And everyone knows that Jews victimize Christians and are basically child-murdering Christ-killing economy-ruining atrocity-committing scum.
</p>
<p>You have been boxed in by a serious of individually harmless but collectively dangerous statements. None of them individually referred to you – you weren’t murdering children or killing Christ or owning a bank. But they ended up getting you in the end anyway.
</p>
<p>Depending on how likely you think this is, this kind of forces Jews together, makes them become strange bedfellows. You might not like what the Jews in Israel are doing in Palestine. But if you think someone’s trying to build a superweapon against you, and you don’t think you can differentiate yourself from the Israelis reliably, it’s in your best interest to defend them anyway.
</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>I wrote the superweapon post to address some of my worries about feminism, so it would not be surprising at all if we found this dynamic there.
</p>
<p>Feminists tend to talk about things like “Men tend to silence women and not respect their opinions” or “Men treat women like objects …</p></div></div>

				<p>I’ve decided to make a series of at least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpUkQYy-K8Y-wYcDgDXKhfs6OT8fFQtVm" target="_blank">8 free weekly-based webinars</a> about<strong> in-depth implementation details of the .NET GC</strong> and… I’m super happy with it! Why the idea? Many <strong>my other activities are about more practical “.NET memory management”</strong>, like <a href="https://prodotnetmemory.com/" target="_blank">my book</a> or <a href="https://workshop.prodotnetmemory.com/" target="_blank">workshops/trainings/consultancy</a> I gave. But during all this practical-oriented events t<strong>here is always not enough time</strong> to explain in details how .NET GC is implemented. Obviously, I always explain some concepts and algorithms, to the level that helps in understanding the whole concept. But not with the level of details that I am satisfied.</p>
<p>Hence the idea – make a separate <strong>content that will be just as deep as I like</strong> 🙂 So, I will cover details on the level of bits, bytes and source code, not only on the level of the overall algorithm description.</p>
<p>The first episode was yesterday, feel invited to watch:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i1Nv7wGsjk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<p>The topics I’ve covered in the first module:</p>
<ul>
<li>the whole series roadmap</li>
<li>some fundamentals like reference counting (including more modern algorithms) and tracing GC</li>
<li>.NET GC types and its history</li>
<li>first dive into the .NET 5 runtime source code, including the first breakpoints in the famous 40 kLOC gc.cpp</li>
</ul>
<p>And the whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpUkQYy-K8Y-wYcDgDXKhfs6OT8fFQtVm" target="_blank">playlist is also available on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The topics I will cover during the whole series are as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02.png"><img src="https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02-1024x535.png" alt="gcwebinar02" width="720" height="376" srcset="https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02-1024x535.png 1024w, https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02-300x157.png 300w, https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02-768x401.png 768w, https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02.png 1402w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>
<p>And we will see whethere it ends after eight episodes, or maybe a new interesting topics will emerge (including, from your questions).</p>
<p>Have a nice watch!</p>

On the one hand I really want to push myself. I’m ambitious, I want to leave it all out on the field—some of my peak work moments have come from times when I’ve pushed myself to a place where I didn’t think I could go. We all have more ability to adapt to stress and pressure than we think we do.</p><p>On the other hand, I want to be kind to myself. I wonder how much the drive to push myself is really just a drive to make up for something that I feel is missing or inadequate—and whether pushing myself will actually fill the hole. I also sometimes wonder whether letting myself off the hook is just laziness masquerading as self-care. It’s hard to tell.</p><p>But importantly, I wonder whether pushing myself might, in fact, kill me. Constant pressure creates chronic stress, and there’s all sorts of scientific studies that show that chronic stress is really bad for you. It makes you more susceptible to heart disease, it makes it harder to recover from illnesses, it can affect your sleep, and it can even affect your working memory.</p><p>There’s also all sorts of literature (and conversations on Twitter) that says that stress is actually good for you.&nbsp;</p><p>What gives? How much stress is good, and how much is bad?&nbsp;</p><p>I think that in order to understand the question we posed at the top—how much we should be pushing ourselves—we have to better understand stress. We need to understand what the stress of pushing ourselves does to our bodies, how much we can take of it, and how we can, hopefully, learn to cope with it better.</p><p>That’s what <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805073690">Why Zebra's Don't Get Ulcers</a> by Robert M. Sapolsky is about. Robert's a stress researcher, and as far as I can tell he's one of the good ones. He's the kind of intellectual who's smart, but also smart enough to know what he doesn't know. He's written a book, but he doesn't come across as trying to sell it to you—he's kind of like your zany self-aware smart-as-hell uncle who happens to study the stress responses of baboons for a living.</p><p>In the book Dr. Sapolsky harnesses his own research, as well as a wide array of animal and human studies to figure out the answer to a fairly simple question: how does stress work, and why do humans get stress-related diseases?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an interesting question—you can understand why a human body might react poorly to not being fed enough. But why would psychological stress have dangerous consequences? The basic gist is this:&nbsp;</p><p>The stress response is built to get us out of danger. If you're an animal in the Serengeti and you're being chased by a lion you really, really want to have a stress response. Being stressed means you’re preparing your muscles to move—a lot. Your heart rate rises and pushes blood to your extremities. Glucose is released into your bloodstream to help run your muscles as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The stress response pushes certain parts of your body into high gear—but it also turns certain parts of your body off. For example, when you’re stressed digestion is inhibited. What’s the point of wasting energy on digesting food for later when you might not even survive for 10 more minutes? Reproduction is also inhibited. Same reason.&nbsp;</p><p>This is all well and good in the wild—you don't need to reproduce if a lion is eating your face off. But humans, and some more intelligent animals, have evolved the stress response from an unqualified Good Thing into...well, something that might kill you.</p><p>What’s different about our stress response? Well, we have the ability to <em>anticipate</em> danger. Other animals have this ability too: it’s a good thing to get stressed seeing the lion all the way across the savannah, instead of only when it mauls your intestines out. But humans have evolved this anticipation ability to extend far beyond other animals. We anticipate bad things months, years, or even decades out. And when we do this, the very same stress response gets turned on—even though there is no immediate danger, and there is no immediate way to avoid it.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, you aren’t just activating the stress response for a few minutes when you’re running for your life. Instead, it’s activated all the time—chronically. And this is where the problems start.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember we mentioned earlier that the stress response amps some parts of your body into high gear, and turns off others? If you’re doing that chronically, you start to have problems. Suddenly, your digestive system isn’t just inhibited for a few minutes while you’re escaping danger. It’s chronically inhibited. The same thing happens with your immune system—chronic stress tamps it down, and makes it harder for you to fight off diseases. Stress is bad for your heart too—if you’re pumping blood as if you need to run from something all the time, you’re going to get high blood pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>In these cases, according to Sapolsky, “the stress response can become more dangerous than the stressor itself, especially when the stress is purely psychological.”</p><p>To be clear, stress doesn’t actually make you sick. But it does leave you more vulnerable to disease and illnesses than you otherwise would be—and those <em>can</em> make you very sick.</p><h3><strong>So is stress bad?</strong></h3><p>Stress isn’t good or bad. It’s a tool. In small doses it’s good, but too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing pretty quickly.</p><p>When your stress response is working properly it makes you run faster, your memory gets better, you’re able to focus better. But when your stress response is over-activated, or chronically activated—you get ulcers and heart disease. It’s bad!&nbsp;</p><p>A good analogy is exercise. Too little exercise and you open yourself up to a whole host of diseases, both physical and psychological. Too much, and you can actually kill yourself.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What do we do about it?</strong></h3><p>The answer to the question we posed at the top, then, is that it’s great to push yourself—but you should be paying attention to the signs that tell you that you need a break. And it’s to give yourself plenty of ways to manage stress while you’re going through it, so that it doesn’t affect you as badly as it could.</p><p>This is the really interesting nugget: stress isn’t mathematical. Expose the same person to the same stressor and they will have different stress responses based on their coping strategies. Which means if you want to live a life where you’re pushing yourself, it’s best to develop a variety of coping strategies to help you manage it.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what Sapolsky recommends:</p><h4><strong>Increase your sense of control</strong>.&nbsp;</h4><p>If you put a human in a room where loud noises are going off, you’ll activate their stress response. If you give the human a button to reduce the volume of the loud noises they’ll be less stressed—regardless of whether they even use the button.&nbsp;</p><p>What that means is, just knowing you have the <em>option</em> to reduce stress is enough to make something less stressful—even if you’re not actually controlling the stressors at all.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s why the first few sessions of therapy are often so powerful for patients. You’ve finally found a way to manage how you’re feeling, even though you probably haven’t changed too much about your life.</p><p>When you’re facing mild to moderate stressors, ask yourself, <em>How can I increase my sense of control in this situation?</em> You might find there are simple answers that will make you feel a lot better.</p><h4><strong>Increase your sense of predictability.</strong></h4><p>Rats that are exposed to repeated electric shocks are more likely to get ulcers. But if you ring a bell before you administer the shock—making the shock more predictable—the rats are less likely to get ulcers. If you make the stressor predictable, you only have to get stressed right before it happens. That means you’re not stressed the rest of the time, and therefore the stress response doesn’t wreak as much havoc on your body.</p><p>Making the stressors in your life more predictable can have a similar effect. When you see CEOs that keep their calendars clear and never do phone calls—you’re seeing the benefit of predictability in action.</p><p>Of course, we can’t make our lives totally predictable (and in fact that wouldn’t be desirable.) But the more you can expose yourself to stressors in a predictable way the better off you’ll be. For example, maybe only doomscroll on Twitter once a week. Or only check email a couple of times a day.</p><h4><strong>Create outlets for frustration.</strong></h4><p>When rats that are exposed to repeated stressors are given a piece of wood to gnaw on, they are far less likely to develop ulcers. Outlets for frustration are another important coping mechanism for stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are many unproductive outlets—for example, taking things out on your partner or a co-worker. But there are also many productive ones, like exercise or journaling. Making a list of outlets and making sure to return to them again and again can reduce the havoc that chronic stress can wreak on your body.</p><h4><strong>Increase social support.</strong></h4><p>Social support is the last coping strategy on the list, and it’s perhaps my favorite one.</p><p>If you give a primate a stressor in the lab, you’ll find elevated markers of stress in its behavior and in its blood. But give the primate a stressor when it’s surrounded by friends—its stress markers will be lower, even for the same level of stressor.</p><p>The same thing happens in humans. For example, in one study parents of children who have been killed in war were no more likely to get disease or die—except if they were already widowed or divorced.</p><p>Creating a vibrant sense of social support can put an unmanageable stressor into perspective and help keep it under control. Without social support, even small things can set us off in ways that are unproductive and unhealthy.</p><h2><strong>What did you think of this article?</strong></h2><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMqlgyA7pSRFgxvzNkEFFqsPIvmkxtZ81IiGD0LQzYFL5-AA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1276325438=Amazing">Amazing</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMqlgyA7pSRFgxvzNkEFFqsPIvmkxtZ81IiGD0LQzYFL5-AA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1276325438=Good">Good</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMqlgyA7pSRFgxvzNkEFFqsPIvmkxtZ81IiGD0LQzYFL5-AA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1276325438=Meh">Meh</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMqlgyA7pSRFgxvzNkEFFqsPIvmkxtZ81IiGD0LQzYFL5-AA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1276325438=Bad">Bad</a></p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Dissecting the Apple M1 GPU, Part II]]>

January 22, 2021 | https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-2.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-2.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<header><p>22 Jan 2021</p></header><p>Less than a month ago, I began <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-1.html">investigating the Apple M1 GPU</a> in hopes of developing a free and open-source driver. This week, I’ve reached a second milestone: drawing a triangle with my own open-source code. The vertex and fragment shaders are handwritten in machine code, and I interface with the hardware via the IOKit kernel driver in an identical fashion to the system’s Metal userspace driver.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://rosenzweig.io/M1HelloTriangle.png" alt=""><figcaption>A triangle rendered on the M1 with open-source code</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The bulk of the new code is responsible for constructing the various command buffers and descriptors resident in shared memory, used to control the GPU’s behaviour. Any state accessible from Metal corresponds to bits in these buffers, so understanding them will be the next major task. So far, I have focused less on the content and more on the connections between them. In particular, the structures contain pointers to one another, sometimes nested multiple layers deep. The bring-up process for the project’s triangle provides a bird’s eye view of how all these disparate pieces in memory fit together.</p>
<p>As an example, the application-provided vertex data are in their own buffers. An internal table in yet another buffer points each of these vertex buffers. That internal table is passed directly as input to the vertex shader, specified in another buffer. That description of the vertex shader, including the address of the code in executable memory, is pointed to by another buffer, itself referenced from the main command buffer, which is referenced by a handle in the IOKit call to submit a command buffer. Whew!</p>
<p>In other words, the demo code is not yet intended to demonstrate an understanding of the fine-grained details of the command buffers, but rather to demonstrate there is “nothing missing”. Since GPU virtual addresses change from run to run, the demo validates that all of the pointers required are identified and can be relocated freely in memory using our own (trivial) allocator. As there is a bit of “magic” around memory and command buffer allocation on macOS, having this code working at an early stage gives peace of mind going forward.</p>
<p>I employed a piecemeal bring-up process. Since my IOKit wrapper exists in the same address space as the Metal application, the wrapper may modify command buffers just before submission to the GPU. As an early “hello world”, I identified the encoding of the render target’s clear colour in memory, and demonstrated that I could modify the colour as I pleased. Similarly, while learning about the instruction set to bring up the disassembler, I replaced shaders with handwritten equivalents and confirmed I could execute code on the GPU, provided I wrote out the machine code. But it’s not necessary to stop at these “leaf nodes” of the system; after modifying the shader code, I tried uploading shader code to a different part of the executable buffer while modifying the command buffer’s pointer to the code to compensate. After that, I could try uploading the commands for the shader myself. Iterating in this fashion, I could build up every structure needed while testing each in isolation.</p>
<p>Despite curveballs, this procedure worked out far better than the alternative of jumping straight to constructing buffers, perhaps via a “replay”. I had used that alternate technique to bring-up Mali a few years back, but it comes with the substantial drawback of fiendishly difficult debugging. If there is a single typo in five hundred lines of magic numbers, there would be no feedback, except an error from the GPU. However, by working one bit at a time, errors could be pinpointed and fixed immediately, providing a faster turn around time and a more pleasant bring-up experience.</p>
<p>But curveballs there were! My momentary elation at modifying the clear colours disappeared when I attempted to allocate a buffer for the colours. Despite encoding the same bits as before, the GPU would fail to clear correctly. Wondering if there was something wrong with the way I modified the pointer, I tried placing the colour in an unused part of memory that was already created by the Metal driver – that worked. The contents were the same, the way I modified the pointers was the same, but somehow the GPU didn’t like my memory allocation. I wondered if there was something wrong with the way I allocated memory, but the arguments I used to invoke the memory allocation IOKit call were bit-identical to those used by Metal, as confirmed by <code>wrap</code>. My last-ditch effort was checking if GPU memory had to be mapped explicitly via some side channel, like the <code>mmap</code> system call. IOKit does feature a device-independent memory map call, but no amount of fortified tracing found any evidence of side-channel system call mappings.</p>
<p>Trouble was brewing. Feeling delirious after so much time chasing an “impossible” bug, I wondered if there wasn’t something “magic” in the system call… but rather in the GPU memory itself. It was a silly theory since it produces a serious chicken-and-egg problem if true: if a GPU allocation has to be blessed by another GPU allocation, who blesses the first allocation?</p>
<p>But feeling silly and perhaps desperate, I pressed forward to test the theory by inserting a memory allocation call <em>in the middle</em> of the application flow, such that every subsequent allocation would be at a different address. Dumping GPU memory before and after this change and checking for differences revealed my first horror: an auxiliary buffer in GPU memory tracked all of the required allocations. In particular, I noticed values in this buffer increasing by one at a predictable offset (every <code>0x40</code> bytes), suggesting that the buffer contained an array of handles to allocations. Indeed, these values corresponded exactly to handles returned from the kernel on GPU memory allocation calls.</p>
<p>Putting aside the obvious problems with this theory, I tested it anyway, modifying this table to include an extra entry at the end with the handle of my new allocation, and modifying the header data structure to bump the number of entries by one. Still no dice. Discouraging as it was, that did not sink the theory entirely. In fact, I noticed something peculiar about the entries: contrary to what I thought, not <em>all</em> of them corresponded to valid handles. No, all but the <em>last</em> entry were valid. The handles from the kernel are 1-indexed, yet in each memory dump, the final handle was always <code>0</code>, nonexistent. Perhaps this acts as a sentinel value, analogous to NULL-terminated strings in C. That explanation begs the question of why? If the header already contains a count of entries, a sentinel value is redundant.</p>
<p>I pressed on. Instead of adding on an extra entry with my handle, I copied the last entry <code>n</code> to the extra entry <code>n + 1</code> and overwrote the (now second to last) entry <code>n</code> with the new handle.</p>
<p>Suddenly my clear colour showed up.</p>
<p>Is the mystery solved? I got the code working, so in some sense, the answer must be yes. But this is hardly a satisfying explanation; at every step, the unlikely solution only raises more questions. The chicken-and-egg problem is the easiest to resolve: this mapping table, along with the root command buffer, is allocated via a special IOKit selector independent from the general buffer allocation, and the handle to the mapping table is passed along with the submit command buffer selector. Further, the idea of passing required handles with command buffer submission is not unheard of; a similar mechanism is used on mainline Linux drivers. Nevertheless, the rationale for using 64-byte table entries in shared memory, as opposed to a simple CPU-side array, remains totally elusive.</p>
<p>Putting memory allocation woes behind me, the road ahead was not without bumps (and potholes), but with patience, I iterated until I had constructed the entirety of GPU memory myself in parallel to Metal, relying on the proprietary userspace only to initialize the device. Finally, all that remained was a leap of faith to kick off the IOKit handshake myself, and I had my first triangle.</p>
<p>These changes amount to around 1700 lines of code since the last blog post, available on <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/gpu">GitHub</a>. I’ve pieced together a simple demo animating a triangle with the GPU on-screen. The window system integration is effectively nonexistent at this point: XQuartz is required and detiling the (64x64 Morton-order interleaved) framebuffer occurs in software with naive scalar code. Nevertheless, the M1’s CPU is more than fast enough to cope.</p>
<p>Now that each part of the userspace driver is bootstrapped, going forward we can iterate on the instruction set and the command buffers in isolation. We can tease apart the little details and bit-by-bit transform the code from hundreds of inexplicable magic constants to a real driver. Onwards!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	

	<p>Open source licenses are in the news again. Elastic recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed the licensing for ElasticSearch and Kibana</a> from Apache 2.0 to a choice of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL) or the non-open source Elastic license. Like most open source licensing changes, this one prompted a lot of discussion. Examples <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25776657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> include some of the more printable comments.&nbsp;</p><p>But we’re not here to discuss Elastic’s business model or their choice of license(s).&nbsp; We’re here to discuss ClickHouse licensing and Altinity’s view of it. Here’s the executive summary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ClickHouse is Apache 2.0.&nbsp; Altinity is committed to ensuring it stays that way.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our contributions to ClickHouse are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apache 2.0</a>. Our ecosystem projects like the ClickHouse Kubernetes operator are likewise Apache 2.0. We believe the Apache 2.0 license is best for our users. It’s also the best way to make ClickHouse the most popular SQL data warehouse on the planet. There are several reasons for our outlook.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important feature of Apache 2.0 is that it allows use for any purpose, which is the first of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four essential freedoms</a> of open source software. Such freedom is important for all applications, regardless of whether they run on-prem or as cloud services. Apache 2.0 opens the door to imaginative new services as well as creative paths to develop them. Installed&nbsp;applications morph into online services. Services that hide data behind APIs morph into open data. This freedom is key to enabling innovative new ways to incorporate analytics into applications, which in turn unlocks new business opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 is also a great license for contributors.&nbsp; It has been around since 2004, which is a long time in open source. Corporate legal departments understand it and can easily approve contributions from employees. Individual contributors understand the freedom Apache 2.0 confers to publish their work and use it freely in future. It’s a win-win: companies are motivated to make investment decisions in open source projects, and contributors are motivated to implement them.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 licensing opens a path to increasing ClickHouse capabilities and worldwide use. More important, it is enabling a flood of innovation in analytic applications. In a crowded market with many database products besides ClickHouse, that’s a critical competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-apache-2-0-creates-a-level-playing-field">Apache 2.0 creates a level playing field</h2>
</p><p>Since the ClickHouse Apache 2.0 license places no restriction on business use, we can expect many competing services that leverage ClickHouse in one way or another.&nbsp; This includes hosted ClickHouse and value-added analytic services built on top of ClickHouse capabilities. It also extends to add-ons for countless existing services ranging from web analytics to network flow log management to financial asset valuation and everything in between.</p><p>The competition will be distressing for unprepared vendors, but it’s great for users. Competing services mean that users have alternatives. It also means that innovation is not random but focused on things that users care about: SQL features, performance, security, cost-efficiency, and time to market.&nbsp;</p><p>The same vendors that offer ClickHouse managed services have contributed popular features to ClickHouse like <a href="https://altinity.com/blog/clickhouse-and-s3-compatible-object-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S3 storage integration</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/access-rights/#role-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Role-based Access Control</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Common Table Expressions</a>, and many more. ClickHouse is experiencing the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-opetition</a> feedback effect that helped fuel the success of Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and other open source projects.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-restrictive-licenses-like-sspl-are-antithetical-to-user-interests">Restrictive licenses like SSPL are antithetical to user interests</h2>
</p><p>The Server Side Public License is an attempt to set back the clock on open source software development. It rules out new SaaS offerings based on projects whose value&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p>…entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.&nbsp; (SSPL Section 13).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p>The goal of the SSPL and similar licenses is nothing short of setting up monopoly providers of SaaS offerings. It has ambiguous terms–creating uncertainty for potential competitors–and onerous viral requirements. Services that fall under Section 13 must release all source code required to run the entire SaaS offering. That includes everything from the service management plane down to deployment and backup scripts. SSPL is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copyleft</a> with fangs.&nbsp;</p><p>This obviously affects vendors trying to set up competing services to the copyright holders of SSPL projects. But the effect on the market is far wider.&nbsp; Analytics are pervasive in modern applications and SaaS is the primary way that software is now distributed. The SSPL potentially harms any user building an application who just wants a managed offering to take care of running it. We believe that’s an unacceptable limitation.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-but-wait-what-about-amazon">But wait, what about Amazon?</h2>
</p><p>Many vendors have justified <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open source relicensing as a necessary defense</a> against “strip mining” from public clouds. Aren’t we afraid of this ourselves? If so, it’s a bit late. There are already multiple cloud services for ClickHouse, including our own offering, <a href="https://altinity.com/cloud-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altinity.Cloud</a>. There’s also <a href="https://cloud.yandex.com/services/managed-clickhouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yandex.Cloud</a> and at least three services in China. New entrants need to compete by adding additional value, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/07/08/suse-acquires-rancher-labs-reported-600m-chases-1b-revenue-goal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just as Rancher did</a> in the Apache 2.0-licensed Kubernetes market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal at Altinity is to help customers bring high-value analytic applications to market quickly and operate them cost-effectively. We focus on development efficiency, data privacy, world-class support, and operations. We do so on all platforms, both public cloud and on-prem. Anybody who has worked on such services knows there’s opportunity here to build many valuable companies, not just one.&nbsp;</p><p>Other paths are possible. Vendors may fork ClickHouse and try to add licenses that create a proprietary fortress. If so, we would point to some friendly advice from a famous competitive analyst of the Italian Renaissance:&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p><em>So the best fortress that exists is to avoid being hated by the people. If you have fortresses and the people hate you, they will not save you</em>.</p>
<p><cite><em>Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince</em></cite></p></blockquote>
</div><p>We don’t want to build new fortresses to protect ourselves against our users. We want to tear them down. Apache 2.0 is the key to enabling a new generation of analytic applications based on ClickHouse. Altinity is all in.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S., If you are worried about ElasticSearch and Kibana switching licenses, this might be a nice time to look at alternatives. ClickHouse can store log data remarkably well. More on that in future articles.&nbsp;</p>

			The EU has lost credibility on human rights by sealing an investment deal with China, a resolution in the European Parliament warned on Thursday.</p><p>

MEPs meeting by videolink in Brussels overwhelmingly passed the resolution which broadly condemned the crackdown on Hong Kong activists by the central government in China.</p><p>

The resolution also called for "targeted sanctions" against Chinese and Hong Kong officials held responsible for the police action.</p><p>

The opinion of EU lawmakers is important as they will need to approve the German-backed investment deal that was agreed in principle last month after years of talks.</p><p>

Given the Hong Kong crackdown, doubts about the accord have quickly emerged, with ratification by MEPs very much uncertain, though the vote is not expected until the end of the year at the earliest.</p><p>

The resolution said that MEPs "regret" that the EU-China investment talks were not seized "as a leverage tool aimed at preserving Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, as well as its basic rights and freedoms".</p><p>

"By rushing to reach this agreement while not taking concrete action against ongoing, grave human right violations, for example in Hong Kong, Xinjiang province and Tibet, the EU risks undermining its credibility as a global human rights actor," it said.</p><p>

China is accused of grave human rights abuses against the Uighur minority in Xinjiang.</p><p>

The resolution said parliament will "carefully scrutinise" the deal and will take the human rights situation in China into account when it votes on the deal.</p><p>

The EU commission, which began negotiating the deal in 2014, said it helps rectify the long-standing imbalance in the way Brussels and Beijing treat investors and the access they allow them.</p><p>

It also says that China agreed through the deal - known as the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) - to work harder towards approving International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions on forced labour. (AFP)		</p></div></div>]]>

<p>So every so often the strange economics of open-source software hits me.</p>
<p><span id="more-2749"></span><br>
Today it is almost taken for granted that the source code for most software is freely available. This is a profound and remarkable change, given how different it was only 15 years ago. From a certain point of view our industry is “giving away” its product, and yet the industry <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/is-big-tech-too-powerful-ask-google.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is richer and more powerful than ever</a>.&nbsp; So where is the value? What are the implications?</p>
<h2>Where has all the closed-source software gone?</h2>
<p>Of course, it’s not <strong>gone</strong>. It’s there at the banks, within embedded devices, and companies such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle</a> remain among the most powerful companies in the world, but almost all the innovation — and most importantly most of the excitement —&nbsp; is happening within open-source.</p>
<p>Within our industry it is becoming apparent that services — <a href="http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Software-as-a-Service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS</a>&nbsp; and companies such as <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb </a>— are the future.&nbsp; And in fact, it sometimes seems to be that the only way to write really valuable closed-source software nowadays is within the context of a service. Behind all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST</a> endpoints, the&nbsp; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS ELBs</a>, and the<a href="http://www.haproxy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> HAProxy systems</a>, sits some of most closely-guarded software in the world.</p>
<h2>The ever-increasing dominance of open-source</h2>
<p>The increasing dominance of open-source software seems particularly true with respect to infrastructure software.&nbsp; While security software has often been open-source through necessity — no-one would trust it otherwise — infrastructure is becoming the dominant category of open-source. Look at databases — <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/guided-tour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.rethinkdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RethinkDB</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apache/couchdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CouchDB</a>, <a href="https://influxdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfluxDB</a> (of which I am part of the <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">development team</a>), or <a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cockroachdb</a>. Is there anyone today that would even consider developing a new closed-source database? Or take search technology — <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elasticsearch</a>, <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solr</a>, and <a href="http://www.blevesearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bleve</a> — all open-source. And <a href="https://www.linux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux</a> is so obvious, it is almost pointless to mention it.<br>
If you want to create a closed-source infrastructure solution, you better have an enormously compelling story, or be delivering it as part of a bigger package such as a software appliance.</p>
<h2>So where is the value?</h2>
<p>Compared to when I first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started programming,</a> that some of the most valuable companies in software now give away their product is astounding, when you actually think about it. So where is the real value within a such a company, when its product is free? It’s where it’s always been — just more so.</p>
<p>The real value is within the development team and its ideas, that the team behind the software are, and remain, innovative, execute well, and produce quality software. And that they remain so is key — so that it does not matter that what they produce is freely available.&nbsp; It is of little benefit to a competitor that the source is freely available, when the team behind the project is probably six months ahead — and often more — conceptually in terms of design, development and process.</p>
<h2>The economics of recruitment</h2>
<p>And the implications go far beyond how software is developed.<br>
It is generally accepted these days within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">The Valley</a> that large, older, firms find it particularly hard to hire. The excitement, and latitude for creativity, within a start-up has always appealed, and even more so now with the outstanding <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-28/facebook-s-22-billion-whatsapp-deal-buys-10-million-in-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commercial success of some</a>.</p>
<p>But a second-order effect is also prevalent — many developers baulk at the idea that their work may never be seen by their peers in the open-source community, and therefore may never help them progress in their careers. And it is at larger, older firms, that the least amount of open-source software is written — what <a href="http://paulgraham.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Graham</a> calls <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downwind jobs</a>.</p>
<p>But Services remain part of the future — because while the code that Service software developers write may not be visible, the functionality is visible to the world and with the advent of cloud-computing, the power accruing to these developers is significant and growing. Services can hire, unlike the traditional firms.</p>
<h2>Possibilities for our grandchildren</h2>
<p>The rise of open-source has been a remarkable development in the history of economics and production. I often wonder what <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keynes</a>, Marx, and even Ricardo, would think of it all.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>PostHog has pivoted <em>a lot</em>.</p>
<p>After 5 pivots in 6 months, we got into <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a> last year, pivoted again whilst we were there and have now gone from the first commit to thousands of deployments, a team across 10 countries and $12M raised, in well under a year. We've a long way to go, but we're delighted at how it has gone so far.</p>
<p>This is that story and what we learned from it.</p>
<h2 id="youll-feel-silly"><a href="#youll-feel-silly" aria-label="youll feel silly permalink"></a>You'll feel silly</h2>
<p>It goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convince yourself then your family, friends and colleagues you have some great idea.</li>
<li>Quit your job.</li>
<li>Build it. Listen to the soundtrack from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">The Social Network</a> way too much.</li>
<li>Everyone thinks your thing is terrible. Hopefully you realize.</li>
</ol>
<p>The nature of a startup is that you have to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6g-how-to-talk-to-users">talk to users</a>. Or so we've heard.</p>
<p>My sole focus for weeks on end was just to get meetings with people that we felt may have the same problem we were trying to solve.</p>
<h2 id="it-got-good-eventually-right"><a href="#it-got-good-eventually-right" aria-label="it got good eventually right permalink"></a>It got good eventually, right?</h2>
<p>In 9 months, we built 6 products and did more than 100 meetings with potential users.</p>
<p>The range of ideas we tried to solve looks broad, but the thing that connected all of them was that we tackled problems we'd experienced in our previous professional lives.</p>
<p>So, what did we build?</p>
<h3 id="1-sales-territory-management-tool"><a href="#1-sales-territory-management-tool" aria-label="1 sales territory management tool permalink"></a>1. Sales Territory Management Tool</h3>
<p>At one stage in my life, I was the VP of Sales at an enterprise software company. On paper, it looked like a glamorous job - I used to fly around the world with the sales team, and met with huge enterprise clients in fancy skyscrapers, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commerce_Centre">ICC in Hong Kong</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://posthog.com/static/international-commerce-centre-44dfcde59997db42043f10c44a88f782.jpg">
                    <img src="https://posthog.com/static/international-commerce-centre-44dfcde59997db42043f10c44a88f782.jpg" srcset="https://posthog.imgix.net/static/international-commerce-centre-44dfcde59997db42043f10c44a88f782.jpg?w=175 175w, https://posthog.imgix.net/static/international-commerce-centre-44dfcde59997db42043f10c44a88f782.jpg?w=350 350w, https://posthog.imgix.net/static/international-commerce-centre-44dfcde59997db42043f10c44a88f782.jpg?w=700 700w, https://posthog.imgix.net/static/international-commerce-centre-44dfcde59997db42043f10c44a88f782.jpg?w=1000 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="International Commerce Center - a big skyscraper in Hong Kong" alt="International Commerce Center - a big skyscraper in Hong Kong" loading="lazy">
                </a></p>
<p>Despite this, the <em>majority</em> of your time in sales is spent getting nowhere. All those hotels, flights, calls, fastidiously wearing a suit in inappropriately warm weather - very few of those things result in anything.</p>
<p>Sidenote: this is why <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/strategy">product led growth</a> is so much better.</p>
<p>If you're not getting anywhere with a potential customer after a few weeks or months of trying, your time is better spent elsewhere. Yet systems that are the core products of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce">$17.1Bn revenue companies</a> come with a manually selected arbitrary number for the percentage probability that doesn't vary with time.</p>
<p>We pulled pipeline data from Hubspot or Salesforce, then used predictive analytics to work out how this curve looked based on historic data, then applied it to the current pipeline. Once a deal dropped below a certain threshold, we'd recommend you swap out that target company and pull a new one into the pipeline.</p>
<p>We confused a lot of people with this idea, because we were confused with whom we were targeting.</p>
<p>We got 15 sales leaders to agree to trying this out, sent them a link, then waited...</p>
<p>and waited...</p>
<p>just <em>one</em> person even clicked the sign up link. The rest didn't even try it.</p>
<p>With hindsight, it was way overpowered for tiny teams and we'd only have had a great fit for huge ones with a lot of data.</p>
<p>The only people interested in smaller teams were enthusiasts, but there wasn't an easy jump from that to a bigger market. We could have just worked on selling the product to big companies, but that would be <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/3O-why-big-deals-are-bad-for-startups">tough</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-crm-with-predictive-analytics"><a href="#2-crm-with-predictive-analytics" aria-label="2 crm with predictive analytics permalink"></a>2. CRM with Predictive Analytics</h3>
<p>One of our friends who ran a small sales team was a clear outliter. He had been using our first product a lot. We asked ourselves - why?</p>
<p>He had used it to <em>replace</em> his CRM. </p>
<p>Could we just do the whole lot in one place, and reimagine the CRM - would that make things feel simpler?</p>
<p>We positioned the product as a CRM for small companies, with predictive analytics for an even simpler experience managing everything. We tweaked the functionality to have more control over deals and contacts.</p>
<p>It suddenly got really hard to get anyone to talk to us.</p>
<p>There are many lightweight CRMs out there, and predictive analytics make more sense for those with more data, not startups with hardly any.</p>
<p>This was around the time that <a href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a> was getting pretty popular; we got overexcited, and kept using words like "blazing", "gorgeous", "brilliant". I blame too much time wasted reading <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/vc-brags-twitter/">VC Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>We didn't think through who we were building for. The market we were working on was very busy, so if I went back in time, I would have focused more on our differentiation - a product could make more sense than a platform. Tim and I also just weren't strong enough at design to differentiate on that alone.</p>
<p>After hundreds of messages to potential users, we eventually got a single customer for $20/month, who then didn't actually pay the invoice. If you're pushing this hard and getting nowhere, you don't have the magic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-vfn97QTr0">product market fit</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3-11-tool-with-predictive-analytics"><a href="#3-11-tool-with-predictive-analytics" aria-label="3 11 tool with predictive analytics permalink"></a>3. 1:1 Tool with Predictive Analytics</h3>
<p>Back to basics - what was the actual problem we were solving?</p>
<p>It was the prioritization of where to focus your sales efforts. If 90% of your deals deals won't close, you need to get good at not spending time on those that aren't going to close.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove">Andrew Grove</a> has an excellent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=high+output+management&amp;qid=1610712757&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">High Output Management</a>. The premise is that your 1:1 meetings with your direct reports are your most leveraged time.</p>
<p>Yet, many managers in practise don't prepare, at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://posthog.com/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg">
                    <img src="https://posthog.com/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg" srcset="https://posthog.imgix.net/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg?w=175 175w, https://posthog.imgix.net/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg?w=350 350w, https://posthog.imgix.net/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg?w=700 700w, https://posthog.imgix.net/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg?w=1000 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="A team that look a little bit like their happiness is staged" alt="A team that look a little bit like their happiness is staged" loading="lazy">
                </a></p>
<p>We changed the UX completely, and made an app that looked a bit like google docs, where you and your reports could each create an agenda in advance and take notes. The twist? The product would interpret your sales pipeline and would use predictive analytics to suggest specific deals to discuss that could be worth replacing or that had changed dramatically since the previous week.</p>
<p>We managed to get lots of meetings easily with this idea, and everyone reported not preparing to the standard they wanted. Did we have a silver bullet?</p>
<p>Despite giving out logins, only one team out of around 10 started using the tool. </p>
<p>We were flumoxed. This tool was simple, people were excited, but no one used it.</p>
<p>For those that haven't read it, <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a>, which I wish I'd read sooner, explains our downfall here perfectly:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If they haven't solved the problem, ask why not. Have they tried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care enough to have Googled for it?

Rule of thumb: Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie.</code></pre></div>
<p>If we'd have asked this question, we'd have saved a couple more weeks.</p>
<p>By this stage, we were thinking we just wanted to work with people that would at least try our stuff. These pesky heads of sales were just too capricious and we needed a break.</p>
<p>Software engineers, surely they'd be more willing to try something that we built. We moved on to a different idea we'd had. Voilà:</p>
<h3 id="4-technical-debt-monitoring-tool-using-surveys-after-each-pull-request"><a href="#4-technical-debt-monitoring-tool-using-surveys-after-each-pull-request" aria-label="4 technical debt monitoring tool using surveys after each pull request permalink"></a>4. Technical Debt Monitoring Tool using Surveys after each Pull Request</h3>
<p>We'd seen the impact of technical debt not being paid off at the right rate in our past, and had the perspective that automation isn't key to solving it. We believed that engineers knew when it was worth tackling.</p>
<p>I spoke with every developer or engineering leader I'd ever worked with, and many I hadn't. They all said this problem was a huge pain point.</p>
<p>So we built a survey tool that integrated with git repositories. After each pull request, it would ask the developer to answer a few quick questions - did anything slow them down, what type of problem was it, and roughly how much time was wasted. The tool would then visualize the code base against time lost to help surface where to start.</p>
<p>We got quite a lot of users, and we got into YCombinator with this idea. Three weeks into the batch, we had reached 600 users, with a 50% response rate to the surveys.</p>
<p>We had started trying to charge people for the product. But we kept getting feedback that although it was a nice way to log issues, it just wasn't helping solve the problem. A few teams converted at very low order values with a lot of pushing, but it was clear we had a problem.</p>
<p>It turns out everyone has problems with technical debt, but solving it involves changing how teams prioritize. Product teams weren't using the tool, and they were often dictating what people built.</p>
<p>After a meetup with our YC friends at a cool <a href="http://sparksocialsf.com/">food truck spot</a>, we took a long walk back to our house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castro_District,_San_Francisco">Castro</a>. We were thinking about how to solve our product woes. Could it turn into a piece of roadmapping software? Would it need to integrate with the roadmap software already in use? We just didn't feel excited about building these things out.</p>
<p><a href="https://posthog.com/static/about-to-run-out-of-product-ideas-31f3a4983d29ab835ee25c87a04dcb56.jpeg">
            <img src="https://posthog.com/static/about-to-run-out-of-product-ideas-31f3a4983d29ab835ee25c87a04dcb56.jpeg" title="James and Tim at a group ycombinator meetup about to walk home" alt="James and Tim at a group ycombinator meetup about to walk home" loading="lazy">
        </a></p>
<p>A couple of days later, driving between Mountain View and San Francisco, we realized that we just weren't the right people to run this business.</p>
<p>Although Tim had struggled with technical debt first hand, neither of us had solved it. If one of us had managed an engineering team before, we'd have perhaps been better placed to understand things. Our basic skills were good enough to get quite far with the idea, but we didn't have the belief to take it further.</p>
<p>Along the way, we learned a lot about how developers and product managers work together. We'd also created a big list of future ideas we'd had whilst building all the above things out. If you can't stop thinking of other ideas, you probably are building something you don't like. This all came into play for idea 6 later on (the good one).</p>
<p>So what did we do next?</p>
<h3 id="5-engineering-retention-tool-using-surveys-after-each-pull-request"><a href="#5-engineering-retention-tool-using-surveys-after-each-pull-request" aria-label="5 engineering retention tool using surveys after each pull request permalink"></a>5. Engineering Retention Tool using Surveys after each Pull Request</h3>
<p>Those fickle engineers joining companies and leaving them whenever they want to ;)</p>
<p>This idea didn't come from us, which doomed it before it even really started.</p>
<p>This lasted all of 5 days. We had a bunch of meetings left over from (4) to validate it. Amusingly we had to do a YCombinator demo day dry run for this in front of 500 people who made up the YC batch.</p>
<p>We had a wildly unenthusiastic response from prospective users. The lowlight was during one of the meetings that we resorted to asking the CTO of an 80 person start up what his biggest problem was, "I've not really got any". Noice, noice.</p>

<p>Things got meta.</p>
<p>Along our journey (/series of failed ideas), we got frustrated having to send all our user data to 3rd parties to understand our product usage. It felt wrong and it meant we'd …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

                    <h3><a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a>*</h3><p>Shopify is an e-commerce platform and has one of the most mature app marketplaces. The marketplace listings include user reviews, payments, videos, and more. App makers can even use paid ads within the marketplace to get in front of more potential customers. This is a marketplace with plenty of opportunity and plenty of competition.</p><p><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>*</h3><p>Wordpress powers a huge percentage of all websites. It's the most popular website builder (or content management system). Their plugin marketplace has user reviews, download numbers, and more. Most plugins are free, and most of the paid ones charge one time fees. This is another marketplace with plenty of opportunity and plenty of competition.</p><p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a></h3><p>Squarespace is another popular website builder. If you listen to podcasts, you'll likely have heard one of their ads. Their marketplace is quite tiny and less advanced then a lot of the above. It doesn't have user reviews, but does have pricing information.</p><p><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/extensions/home" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a></h3><p>Webflow is a website builder targeting no-code makers and designers. It seems to be growing rapidly, but their marketplace is still super basic.</p><p><a href="https://university.webflow.com/integrations" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a>*</h3><p>Wix is another website builder which is mostly used by small businesses.

A lot of them fit into some sort of "productivity" or "collaboration" category.</p><h3><a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a></h3><p>Zoom is a wildly popular video call/conferencing service. They recently launched "Zapps" which are apps that enhance the zoom experience. As their marketplace is brand new, and isn't fully launched yet. I have no clue how popular Zapps will become, but I'd bet there are some great opportunities here.</p><p><a href="https://zoom.us/docs/en-us/zoom-apps.html" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a></h3><p>Slack is a live chat app for teams. Their app marketplace doesn't include user reviews, but it is fairly mature. Most Slack teams use a few apps and there are features built into the Slack service that helps people discover apps. As with Shopify, this is a marketplace with plenty of opportunity and plenty of competition.</p><p><a href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams</a>*</h3><p>Microsoft Teams is the live chat product from Microsoft.

Personally, I wouldn't put too much trust into any of the Google marketplaces as they have a history of being less friendly to their app developers when compared to other B2B app marketplaces.</p><p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a></p><h3><a href="https://airtable.com/" target="_blank">Airtable</a></h3><p>Airtable is a powerful spreadsheet type tool with a newer marketplace. The marketplace is fairly basic at the moment, but it's very new and I imagine it will become more advanced in the future.</p><p><a href="https://airtable.com/marketplace" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a></h3><p>Zapier is an automation tool that lets you connect various products so they can work better together.

<p>Whether you're a software developer or a sysadmin, I bet you're using SSH keys.
Pushing your commits to Github or managing your Unix systems, it's best practice to do this over SSH with public key authentication rather than passwords.
However, as time flies, many of you are using older keys and not aware of the need to generate fresh ones to protect your privates much better.
In this post I'll demonstrate how to transition to an Ed25519 key smoothly, why you would want this and show some tips and tricks on the way there.</p>
<div>
<p>Tl;dr:</p>
<p>Generate your new key with <code>ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519</code>, specify a strong passphrase and read further if you need a smooth transition.</p>
</div>
<p>I'm planning to publish some more posts on SSH tips &amp; tricks, so keep an eye on my blog for more.
This post will focus on about SSH keys as user public key authentication.</p>
<h2 id="dsa-and-rsa-1024-bit-are-deprecated-now">DSA and RSA 1024 bit are deprecated now<a href="#dsa-and-rsa-1024-bit-are-deprecated-now" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>If you've created your key more than about four years ago with the default options it's probably insecure (RSA &lt; 2048 bits).
Even worse, I've seen tweeps, colleagues and friends still using DSA keys (<code>ssh-dss</code> in OpenSSH format) recently.
That's a key type similar to RSA, but limited to 1024 bits size and therefore <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/5100/12948">recommended against</a> for a long time.
It's plainly insecure and refused for valid reasons in recent OpenSSH versions (see also the <a href="http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.0">changelog for 7.0</a>).</p>
<p>The sad thing about it is that I see posts on how to re-enable DSA key support rather than moving to a more secure type of key.
Really, it's unwise to follow instructions to change the configuration for <code>PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes</code> or <code>HostKeyAlgorithms</code> (host keys are for a later post).
Instead, upgrade your keys!</p>
<p><img alt="Picture of an ancient key" src="https://blog.g3rt.nl/images/20160923_old_key_picture.jpg"></p>
<p>Compare DSA with the technology of locks using keys like this one.
You wouldn't want this type of key to unlock your front door, right?</p>

<h2 id="determine-your-current-situation">Determine your current situation<a href="#determine-your-current-situation" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>

<li>ECDSA: depends. Recommended to change</li>
<li>Ed25519: wow cool, but are you brute-force safe?</li>
</ul>

<p>You're probably thinking… "I'm using my key for a long time, I don't want to change them everywhere now."
Valid point, but you don't have to! It's good to know you can have multiple keys on your system and your SSH client will pick the right one for the right system automatically.</p>
<p>It's part of the SSH protocol that it can offer multiple keys and the server picks the one your client will have to prove it has possession of the private key by a challenge.
See it in action adding some verbosity to the SSH connect command (<code>-vvv</code>).
Also if you're using an SSH agent you can load multiple keys and it will discover them all.
Easy as that.</p>
<h2 id="youll-like-the-twisted-edwards-curve">You'll like the Twisted Edwards curve<a href="#youll-like-the-twisted-edwards-curve" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Most common is the RSA type of key, also known as <code>ssh-rsa</code> with SSH.
It's very compatible, but also slow and potentially insecure if created with a small amount of bits (&lt; 2048).
We just learned that your SSH client can handle multiple keys, so enable yourself with the newest faster elliptic curve cryptography and enjoy the very compact key format it provides!</p>
<p>Ed25519 keys are short. Very short. If you're used to copy multiple lines of characters from system to system you'll be happily surprised with the size. The public key is just about 68 characters. It's also much faster in authentication compared to secure RSA (3072+ bits).</p>
<p>Generating an Ed25519 key is done using the <code>-t ed25519</code> option to the ssh-keygen command.</p>
<p>Ed25519 is a reference implementation for EdDSA using Twisted Edward curves (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Edwards_curve">Wikipedia link</a>).</p>
<h2 id="increase-resistance-to-brute-force-password-cracking">Increase resistance to brute-force password cracking<a href="#increase-resistance-to-brute-force-password-cracking" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>When generating the keypair, you're asked for a passphrase to encrypt the private key with.
If you will ever lose your private key it should protect others from impersonating you because it will be encrypted with the passphrase.
To actually prevent this, one should make sure to prevent easy brute-forcing of the passphrase.</p>
<p>OpenSSH key generator offers two options to resistance to brute-force password cracking: using the new OpenSSH key format and increasing the amount of key derivation function rounds.
It slows down the process of unlocking the key, but this is what prevents efficient brute-forcing by a malicious user too.
I'd say experiment with the amount of rounds on your system.
Start at about 100 rounds.
On my system it takes about one second to decrypt and load the key once per day using an agent.
Very much acceptable, imo.</p>
<p>With <code>ssh-keygen</code> use the <code>-o</code> option for the new RFC4716 key format and the use of a modern key derivation function powered by bcrypt.
Use the <code>-a &lt;num&gt;</code> option for <code>&lt;num&gt;</code> amount of rounds.</p>
<p>Actually, it appears that when creating a Ed25519 key the <code>-o</code> option is implied.</p>
<p>The OpenSSH manpages are not really explanatory about the 'new' format.
I found this article pretty useful: <a href="http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/new-openssh-key-format-and-bcrypt-pbkdf">"new openssh key format and bcrypt pbkdf" on www.tedunangst.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="generate-your-new-sexy-ed25519-key">Generate your new sexy Ed25519 key<a href="#generate-your-new-sexy-ed25519-key" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span><span>$</span> ssh-keygen -o -a <span>100</span> -t ed25519
</span><span>Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.</span>
<span>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):</span>
<span>Enter same passphrase again:</span>
<span>Your identification has been saved in /home/gert/.ssh/id_ed25519.</span>
<span>Your public key has been saved in /home/gert/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.</span>
<span>The key fingerprint is:</span>
<span>SHA256: [...] gert@hostname</span>
<span>The key's randomart image is: [...]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note the line 'Your identification has been saved in /home/gert/.ssh/id_ed25519'.
Your current RSA/DSA keys are next to it in the same <code>~/.ssh</code> folder.
As with any other key you can copy the public key in <code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code> to target hosts for authentication.</p>
<h2 id="multi-key-aware-ssh-client">Multi-key aware SSH client<a href="#multi-key-aware-ssh-client" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>All keys available on default paths will be autodetected by SSH client applications, including the SSH agent via ssh-add.
So, if you were using an application like ssh/scp/rsync before like...</p>

<p>it will now offer multiple public keys to the server and the server will request proof of possession for a matching entry for authentication.
And your daily use of the <code>ssh-add</code> command will not change and autodiscover the Ed25519 key:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span><span>$</span> ssh-add
</span><span>Enter passphrase for /home/gert/.ssh/id_rsa:</span>
<span>Identity added: /home/gert/.ssh/id_rsa (gert@hostname)</span>
<span>Identity added: /home/gert/.ssh/id_ed25519 (gert@hostname)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It not only discovered both keys, it also loaded them by entering a single passphrase (because it's the same)!</p>
<p>We've reached a very important goal now.
Without any change to your daily routine we can slowly change the existing configuration on remote hosts to accept the Ed25519 key.
In the meantime the RSA key will still work.
Great, right!?</p>
<h2 id="change-or-set-a-passphrase">Change or set a passphrase<a href="#change-or-set-a-passphrase" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>If you're afraid this will change your key, don't worry.
The private part of your keypair is encrypted with a passphrase which only exists locally on your machine.
Change it as often as you like.
This is recommended to prevent abuse in case the key file gets into the wrong hands.
Repeat for all your key files to ensure a new key format with 100 bcrypt KDF rounds:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p -o -a <span>100</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="upgrade-your-current-rsa-key">Upgrade your current RSA key<a href="#upgrade-your-current-rsa-key" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Using Ed25519 will (and should) work in most situations by now, but legacy systems may not support them as of yet.
The best fallback is a strong RSA keypair for this.</p>
<p>While the OpenSSH client supports multiple RSA keys, it requires configuration/command line options to specify the path so it's rather error-prone.
Instead, I'd recommend upgrading your existing key in-place to keep things simple once this is done.
Depending on the strength (key size) of your current RSA key you can migrate urgently or comfortably.</p>
<p>In case you have a weak RSA key still, move it out of the way from the standard path and generate a new one of 4096 bits size:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_legacy
<span>$</span> mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa_legacy.pub
<span>$</span> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b <span>4096</span> -o -a <span>100</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are using an agent, manually point it to all your keys:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_legacy ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once you are finished the transition on all remote targets you can go back to convenience and let it autodiscover your new RSA and Ed25519 keys; simply omit the keyfile arguments.</p>
<h2 id="software-support-for-ed25519">Software support for Ed25519<a href="#software-support-for-ed25519" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Support is available since OpenSSH 6.5 and well adopted in the Unix world OSs for workstations.
Ubuntu 14.04+, Debian 8+, CentOS/RedHat 7+ etc. all support it already.
(If you have details about Mac OS X please drop a line, couldn't find it with a quick search).
Some software like custom desktop key agents may not like the new keys for several reasons (see below <a href="#my-gnome-keyring-doesnt-work-anymore">about the Gnome-keyring</a> for example).</p>
<p>Github works pretty well too, by the way.
Launchpad and Gerrit code review however, seem to require RSA keys unfortunately.
PuTTY on Windows? See below.</p>
<h2 id="my-gnome-keyring-doesnt-work-anymore">My Gnome-keyring doesn't work anymore<a href="#my-gnome-keyring-doesnt-work-anymore" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>The Gnome-keyring, as used in Ubuntu Unity at least, fails to read the new RFC4716 format keys but reports success.
It's bugged.
More details here in <a href="https://askubuntu.com/q/564821/88802">my AskUbuntu Q&amp;A post</a>.
I'd recommend disabling the Gnome keyring for SSH agent use and use the plain OpenSSH agent instead.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm not using PuTTY, but make sure to upgrade first.
This page suggests Ed25519 support since a late-2015 version according to a <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/ed25519.html">wishlist item</a>.
Generally speaking, I'm not too excited with the speed of implementation of security features in it.</p>

<p>We've taken some steps, important ones, but it's far from ultimate security.
When dealing with high assurance environments I would strongly discourage key usage like described in this post as this holds the unencrypted private key in memory.
Instead, use hardware security (smart cards) to avoid leaking keys even from memory dumps.
It's not covered in this post, mainly because it requires a hardware device you need to buy and secondly because the limitations are device dependent.
A nice cute solution would be to make use of your TPM already …</p></div></div>

      <p>Im stillen KÃ¤mmerlein arbeitet ownCloud seit Ã¼ber einem Jahr an der neuen Version seiner Software und zeigt nun zum ersten Mal sein neues Projekt Infinite Scale â€“ allerdings sind die Entwickler nicht langsam, sondern haben sich viel vorgenommen. Bis einschlieÃŸlich ownCloud X ist die Software eine klassische LAMP-Applikation: Im Hintergrund werkelt MySQL, Apache serviert PHP-Seiten und das gesamte Konstrukt lÃ¤uft Ã¼blicherweise auf einer Linux-Installation.</p>

<p>Im Laufe der Jahre sind die ownCloud-Entwickler allerdings an immer mehr Performance- und Skalierbarkeitsgrenzen gestoÃŸen, deren Ursache zumeist in entsprechenden Limitierungen in PHP liegt. Wer groÃŸe ownCloud-Installationen betreibt, kennt das: Je mehr Nutzer und Dateien die Instanz verwaltet, desto trÃ¤ger wird sie mit der Zeit. RegelmÃ¤ÃŸig sehen Admins sich zudem mit Speicherplatzmangel konfrontiert, denn bisher speichert ownCloud die Dateien seiner Nutzer lokal auf einem normalen Dateisystem ab. Wird der Platz dort knapp, ist das Problem gar nicht so leicht zu umschiffen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_goodbye_php_0">Goodbye, PHP</h3>
<p>Alle <a href="https://www.heise.de/thema/OwnCloud">diese alten ZÃ¶pfe</a> planen die Entwickler in ownCloud Infinite Scale endgÃ¼ltig abzuschneiden. Dabei handelt es sich mehr Revolution denn Evolution: Ihren alten Code treten die Entwickler fast vollstÃ¤ndig in die Tonne und ersetzen ihn durch einen kompletten Rewrite in Go. oCIS folgt einem Modell aus drei Schichten: Die unterste Schicht kÃ¼mmert sich um das Speichern von Dateien, die mittlere Schicht umfasst alle Kern-Dienste und die dritte Schicht ist das ebenfalls vollstÃ¤ndig neu geschriebene Webinterface.</p>

<p>Der Kern von ownCloud besteht kÃ¼nftig aus verschiedenen Microservices, die einander per gRPC Befehle und Anweisungen zusenden. Die Entwickler bÃ¼ndeln die MESH-Software Traefik fest mit oCIS, um sich um Themen wie Loadbalancing und sichere Kommunikation innerhalb des Service-Netzwerks keine Gedanken machen zu mÃ¼ssen. Was im Umkehrschluss bedeutet: Reichen die laufenden Instanzen eines bestimmten ownCloud-Dienstes nicht mehr aus, lassen sich zusÃ¤tzliche Instanzen desselben Dienstes ad hoc starten.</p>
<p>Architektonisch nutzt oCIS diverse Vorteile von Go zur Beschleunigung. Fordert der Nutzer kÃ¼nftig eine spezielle Aktion per API oder Webinterface an, kÃ¼mmern die einzelnen oCIS-Microservices sich im Hintergrund darum. Der Anwender muss nicht warten, bis die jeweilige Aktion erfolgreich ausgefÃ¼hrt ist, bevor er den nÃ¤chsten Befehl absenden kann. Der Effekt findet sich auch auf der Code-Ebene wieder, wo Go anders als PHP echte NebenlÃ¤ufigkeit beherrscht und damit mehrere Operationen zur selben Zeit ausfÃ¼hren kann.</p>
<p>Obendrein reduziert der Umstieg auf Microservices den administrativen Aufwand von ownCloud. Eine externe Datenbank wie MySQL benÃ¶tigt die Software kÃ¼nftig nicht mehr â€“ um ihre Datenhaltung kÃ¼mmern sich eigene Microservices.</p>

				<h4>Abstract</h4><p>
				New SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike glycoprotein have arisen independently at multiple locations and may have functional significance. The combination of mutations in the 501Y.V2 variant first detected in South Africa include the N501Y, K417N, and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we address whether the 501Y.V2 variant could escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by natural infection with earlier variants. We were the first to outgrow two variants of 501Y.V2 from South Africa, designated 501Y.V2.HV001dF and 501Y.V2.HV002. We examined the neutralizing effect of convalescent plasma collected from six adults hospitalized with COVID-19 using a microneutralization assay with live (authentic) virus. Whole genome sequencing of the infecting virus of the plasma donors confirmed the absence of the spike mutations which characterize 501Y.V2. We infected with 501Y.V2.HV001dF and 501Y.V2.HV002 and compared plasma neutralization to first wave virus which contained the D614G mutation but no RBD or NTD mutations. We observed that neutralization of the 501Y.V2 variants was strongly attenuated, with IC50 6 to 200-fold higher relative to first wave virus. The degree of attenuation varied between participants and included a knockout of neutralization activity. This observation indicates that 501Y.V2 may escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by prior natural infection. It raises a concern of potential reduced protection against re-infection and by vaccines designed to target the spike protein of earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><center> <a href="https://www.krisp.org.za/manuscripts/MEDRXIV-2021-250224v1-Sigal.pdf"> <img alt="" src="https://www.krisp.org.za/imagesBIO/pdf2.png"></a></center><h4>Download: <a href="https://www.krisp.org.za/manuscripts/MEDRXIV-2021-250224v1-Sigal.pdf"> Full text paper</a></h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">Differential dataflow</a> is a library that lets you write simple dataflow programs and a) then runs them in parallel and b) efficiently updates the outputs when new inputs arrive. Compared to competition like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">spark</a> and <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/">kafka streams</a>, it can handle more complex computations and provides dramatically better throughput and latency while using much less memory.</p>
<p>But I'm only aware of a few companies that use it in production, even though it's been around for 5 years. </p>
<p>Possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's missing some important feature, like persistence? </li>
<li>It's had very little advertising?</li>
<li>The api is too hard to use?</li>
<li>The docs / tutorials are not good enough?</li>
<li>Rust is intimidating?</li>
<li>No company to provide paid support?</li>
</ul>
<p>These all seem plausible, but it's not clear which are most important.</p>
<p>Even more surprising is that noone has copied the ideas into some enterprise friendly java monstrosity - despite the fact that differential dataflow is open source and is explained in depth in many papers and blog posts.</p>
<p>I'm interested because <a href="https://materialize.com/">materialize</a> is expending a huge amount of effort adding a SQL layer on top of differential dataflow. That's all very well for people who like SQL, but I'm curious whether there are also potential users who would have been perfectly happy with javascript/python/R bindings and a good tutorial? There are probably multiple niches to be served here.</p>
<p>If you considered using differential dataflow and decided against, please <a href="mailto:jamie@scattered-thoughts.net">let me know</a> why.</p>
<hr>
<p>I got feedback in the form of ~20 emails and ~100 comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25867693">hn</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7zeb3x/why_isn_t_differential_dataflow_more">lobsters</a>. Thanks to everyone who took the time to reach out - it was very helpful.</p>
<p>(To clarify for many fine but confused commenters - I did not make differential dataflow. I'm just trying to find out what more needs to be done to be useful in that niche.)</p>
<p>Reasons given fell in a few buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never heard of differential dataflow </li>
<li>Want a complete drop-in solution (builtin integrations for various other tools, orchestration, monitoring, support, hosting etc) rather than a choose-your-own-adventure library</li>
<li>Api too difficult / docs not good enough</li>
<li>Want to handle late arriving data</li>
</ol>
<p>Materialize is doing a good job with 1-3 already. </p>
<p>I think differential dataflow actually can handle 4, since it can handle bitemporal timestamps, but this isn't something that has been well tested or advertised. That might be worth experimenting with. UPDATE: Frank McSherry posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WijjN0LiZ4">video demo</a>.</p>
<p>All of the people in group 2 talked about typical data processing tasks, but people in group 3 had a much wider range of tasks including large-scale code analysis and monitoring systems with strong latency/consistency requirements. </p>
<p>Group 3 includes many people who seriously evaluated DD but couldn't get past the hello world stage, but also several people who <em>are</em> using DD because nothing else can handle their requirements, but still complain that the api is difficult to use.</p>
<p>Api complaints included:</p>
<ul>
<li>where is all the state? where do all these map/reduce calls actually end up living?</li>
<li>which operators are internally stateful? how much memory will this use? how can I monitor how much memory each operator is using?</li>
<li>too many single-letter type variables with unhelpfully-named bounds</li>
<li>hard to figure out why various traits (eg Data) are not being satisfied</li>
<li>hard to know what methods are available on a collection because they're all in trait impls with complicated bounds</li>
<li>losing track of column names when everything is a tuple</li>
<li>how to feed live data in - examples all show loading static data from a file</li>
<li>how to get data out, especially how to pull results instead of pushing them</li>
<li>hard to integrate threaded workers with tokio executors</li>
<li>hard to integrate with existing tools in javascript/python/r</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like there is some demand for a DD-like tool that:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a simplified, opinionated api</li>
<li>is easy to call from other languages</li>
<li>is easy to target as a compiler backend</li>
<li>is easy to integrate into other event loops</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a very distinct niche from the kafka/spark/flink niche that materialize is targeting - somewhere along a similar dimension to sqlite vs snowflake.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
    <div>
<p>This is a list of C++ anti-patterns that I have seen in various codes.</p>
<!-- END_TEASER -->

<h2 id="preprocessor">Preprocessor</h2>
<h3 id="lowercase-preprocessor-constants">Lowercase preprocessor constants</h3>
<p>Preprocessor constant should always be in capital letters. Otherwise you will
get the weirdest of bugs that take hours to days to track down. Say there is
some feature that you want to switch on/off during compile time. One way to do
it would be using <code>#ifdef</code> like this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>int</span> <span>make_query</span><span>(</span><span>Query</span> <span>const</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>q</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Do some query stuff here.</span>

<span>#ifdef VERIFY_RESULT</span>
    <span>// Perform some verification.</span>
<span>#endif</span>

    <span>// Some other tasks and return statement.</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>When compiling, you can give the option <code>-DVERIFY_RESULT</code> and the preprocessor
will put in the verification code. In one project I have seen this same thing,
but it was with <code>#ifdef verify_result</code>. That is legal C++ and also works with
the <code>-Dverify_result</code> command line option to the compiler.</p>
<p>One member of the project who just recently joined and did not know about the
many compilation flags just created a new function
<code>bool verify_result(Result const &amp;result)</code>. The compiler did not say that the
name was not in use. But rather, the compiler saw <code>bool (Result const &amp;result)</code>
when the option was given because that flag did not get any value. GCC
complained that it did not expect the <code>(</code> there.</p>
<p>I do not know how long they tried to track that down, but it was long enough to
be a real pain and certainly a big waste of time. This would not have happened
if the preprocessor constants had been uppercase all the time.</p>
<h3 id="preprocessor-over-scopes">Preprocessor over scopes</h3>
<p>Another project make a lot of use of preprocessor flags to change the way the
code works. This in itself is not a problem. However, there are pieces of code
like this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#ifdef FLAG</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>With multiple such flags, I do not see how you can sensible reason about this
code.</p>
<h3 id="including-source-files">Including source files</h3>
<p>This was in one of the header files:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#include</span> <span>"other.cpp"</span><span></span>
</code></pre>


<p>Including source files in header files usually is just wrong. One edge case are
unity builds or template specializations. Said project just did it for no
apparent reason.</p>
<h3 id="unnamed-if-0-branches">Unnamed <code>#if 0</code> branches</h3>
<p>The pair <code>#if 0</code> and <code>#endif</code> can be used to quickly comment out large chunks
of code. Contrary to <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>, they have the advantage that they can be
nested and also serve as a sort of super-comment.</p>
<p>When there are multiple of those blocks around, it becomes a bit hard to
understand why some are enabled and others are not enabled:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#if 0</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#if 1</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#if 0</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Is the middle one the negation of the first one? Is the first and third one
actually the same; do they have to be enabled at the same time?</p>
<p>Here I like it better to introduce some named constant for that. The above
could look like the following:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#ifdef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#ifndef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#ifdef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Then it would be easy to understand what is going on. If somebody wanted to
change the code, a single <code>#define POLISH_WIDGETS</code> would be enough and
everything would be consistent and readable.</p>

<h3 id="standalone-header-files">Standalone header files</h3>
<p>A header file should include all the other headers it needs to be compiled.
Something I have seen a couple times is this here:</p>
<p><code>f.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#pragma once</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Notice that the type <code>MyClass</code> is not defined here. It is defined in this
header, but that is not included in <code>f.hpp</code> at all.</p>
<p>It is defined in <code>myclass.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#pragma once</span>

<span>class</span> <span>MyClass</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span><span>:</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>member</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The implementation of the function <code>f</code> is in <code>f.cpp</code>. <em>There</em> the header for
<code>MyClass</code> is included:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#include</span> <span>"myclass.hpp"</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>"f.hpp"</span><span></span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>member</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>And that actually compiles because the compiler only works on the <code>.cpp</code> files.
And given the ordering of the <code>#include</code> statements, the C++ compiler sees
this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>MyClass</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span><span>:</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>member</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>member</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This will work as long as that header <code>f.hpp</code> is always included after
<code>myclass.hpp</code>. It will start to fail when you use <code>f.hpp</code> somewhere else. There
should be an <code>#include "myclass.hpp"</code> in <code>f.hpp</code>.</p>

<p>The order of the header files in <code>f.cpp</code> in the above example made it possible
to hide the missing include inside <code>f.hpp</code> such that it still compiles. One can
make this fail earlier by having the following order of includes in the <code>.cpp</code>
files:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Own" header file, for <code>X.cpp</code> that would be <code>X.hpp</code>
</li>
<li>Project header files</li>
<li>Third-party library headers</li>
<li>Standard library Headers</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, missing include statements in the header will become directly
apparent. You might find a bug in a third-party library this way.</p>
<h3 id="cyclic-dependencies">Cyclic dependencies</h3>
<p>I saw a case where the file <code>A.hpp</code> provides the classes <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>. The
file <code>B.hpp</code> provided <code>B1</code>. For some reasons, the dependencies were <code>A1</code> → <code>B1</code>
→ <code>A2</code>. That is not directly a cyclic dependency of the types but of the header
files. This was "solved" in the project like this in file <code>A.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>A1</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>

<span>#include</span> <span>"B.hpp"</span><span></span>

<span>class</span> <span>A2</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Sure, that compiled just fine. But again, header <code>B.hpp</code> is not a standalone
header and can only be used in this sandwich. I have resolved this by creating
the files <code>A1.hpp</code> and <code>A2.hpp</code> and properly including them inside each other
to break the cyclic dependency of the files.</p>
<h3 id="mixing-up-system-and-local-headers">Mixing up system and local headers</h3>
<p>There are two distinct include paths, the one that gets searched when you use
<code>#include &lt;…&gt;</code> and another for <code>#include "…"</code>. The former is for system and
third-party library headers that are installed globally. You can add to that
path using <code>-I</code>. The latter is for your project and can be amended with <code>-i</code>.
One should not mix the two and use <code>-I.</code> in order to include the local headers
with <code>#include &lt;…&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>One can argue about the usage of <code>using namespace</code>. In most cases I will not
use it to keep the global namespace somewhat clean. Using
<code>using namespace std;</code> in a <code>.cpp</code> file is okay because the namespace <code>std</code> is
just dumped out in a single compilation unit. I do not have to worry about it
in other files.</p>
<p>It becomes a totally different story once you put that <code>using namespace std;</code>
into a header file. Then every other header or source file that includes it
will have that namespace dumped out. Even other projects using that library
will suffer from the attempt to save some typing of the library programming.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-files-with-same-include-guard">Multiple files with same include guard</h3>
<p>I do not like the <code>#ifndef X</code>, <code>#define X</code>, <code>#endif</code> style include guards
because they are so error prone. They are hard to read but even worse, one can
choose the same include guard twice in a project. One could even have the same
include guard that some other library already has used.</p>
<p>If that is the case, the errors will be painfully subtle. Depending on the
order if inclusion, the last header file will just not be included. Then you
get errors about undefined types and undefined functions and might pull out
your hair before you realize what is going on.</p>
<p><code>#pragma once</code> is a good alternative except if you are working with IBM XL 12.
But that compiler cannot do C++11, so it is not that interesting for me anyway.</p>
<h3 id="include-guards-do-not-match-the-filename">Include guards do not match the filename</h3>
<p>If you have <code>#ifndef FOO_H</code> in <code>bar.h</code>, bad things will happen when you create
another <code>foo.h</code>. Therefore the include guard should always be derived from the
path, or use <code>#pragma once</code>.</p>

<p>Using C functions in C++ might be a reasonable thing to do. If you do that, do
not include <code>X.h</code> but rather <code>cX</code>. So instead of <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> use <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>.
This way the C functions will be properly in the <code>std</code> namespace.</p>
<p>Functions like <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>atoi</code>, <code>fopen</code>, <code>malloc</code>, and a bunch of
others should not be used in C++. There are so much better ways.</p>
<h3 id="include-inside-namespaces">
<code>include</code> inside namespaces</h3>
<p>For reason unknown to me, there are a few includes of standard library headers
inside of namespaces. The only reason I can think of is that writing <code>::std::</code>
instead of <code>std::</code> seemed too much work.</p>
<p>GCC 6.0 has changed the standard headers such that they do not work when you
include them inside a namespace. This way one can catch this anti-pattern.</p>
<h2 id="correctness">Correctness</h2>
<h3 id="null-0-and-nullptr">
<code>NULL</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>nullptr</code>
</h3>
<p>In C++ (and C) there are 64-bit unsigned integer number (<code>uint64_t</code> or
<em>perhaps</em> <code>unsigned long</code>) and pointers (<code>void *</code>). In the machine, they are
exactly the same thing, 64-bit unsigned integer numbers. For the type system,
it still makes a great difference.</p>
<p>Although they are both just numbers to the computer, one should help the
programmers read the source code and write</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint64_t</span> <span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This way, it is clear that one is number-zero and the other is pointer-null.
The preprocessor constant <code>NULL</code> is just <code>0</code> or <code>0u</code>, so the compiler always
sees a plain 0 there. Still it is helpful for the programmer to read. In C++11
there even is <code>nullptr</code> which has the correct type, <code>nullptr_t</code>.</p>
<p>In some code you see horrible things like these:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint64_t</span> <span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<h3 id="casting-pointers-to-integers">Casting pointers to integers</h3>
<p>For some reason in one project, pointers are casted to integers. And they are
converted to a special type of integer that you have to choose as a flag to
<code>configure</code> such that the length of that integer is the exact same as the
pointer length, otherwise the compiler would give you an error.</p>
<p>I still do not understand why one would do this sort of brittle code.</p>
<h3 id="subtle-dependence-on-operator-precedence">Subtle dependence on operator precedence</h3>
<p>What is the value of <code>x</code>?</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint32_t</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>3</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<p>I would read it as $2^3 - 1$ and that is seven. The value actually is four.
When compiling with Clang, it conveniently says this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>precedence.cpp:7:25: warning: operator '&lt;&lt;' has lower precedence than '-'; '-' will be evaluated first</span>
<span>      [-Wshift-op-parentheses]</span>
<span>    uint32_t x = 1 &lt;&lt; 3 - 1;</span>
<span>                   ~~ ~~^~~</span>
<span>precedence.cpp:7:25: note: place parentheses around the '-' expression to silence this warning</span>
<span>    uint32_t x = 1 &lt;&lt; 3 - 1;</span>
<span>                        ^</span>
<span>                      (    )</span>
</code></pre>


<p>What did the original author of that line really mean? Was he aware that the
<code>-</code> operation binds stronger than <code>&lt;&lt;</code>? Can I trust that code without
completely understand where all those magic numbers come from?</p>

<p>There are many reasons to look back at 2020 with a whole range of emotions but I would rather look forward.</p>
<h2 id="graphics"><a aria-label="Permalink to Graphics" title="Permalink to 'Graphics'" href="#graphics">Graphics</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>GIMP</strong> team is now focusing on completing version 3.0. It’s too early to say if it will be out in 2021. But unless everything changes dramatically, we’ll see several more 2.99.x releases at the very least.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, not much new is planned, although there’s a new <em>Paint Select</em> tool being worked on by Thomas Manni. And before you ask: no, it’s not AI-based. It’s also designed to do quick binary selection for now, so not very good for selecting strands of hair and suchlike.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Admittedly, I avoid talking about <strong>Glimpse</strong> and <strong>Glimpse-NX</strong> much. I have two major reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, every public conversation about the fork of GIMP ends up in someone attacking either the Glimpse or the GIMP team, and that’s unproductive and tiresome. And then the progress isn’t all that interesting so far.</p>
<p>The fork is just rebranding and no new features or UX fixes (unless removing the bell pepper brush is your idea of finally making it right for everyone), and then Glimpse-NX — at least for the public eye — exists only as <a href="https://github.com/glimpse-editor/glimpse-nx-design/issues">UI mockups</a>. They did get Bilal Elmoussaoui (GNOME team) to create <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/bilelmoussaoui/gegl-rs">Rust bindings to GEGL</a> for them last autumn, but that’s all as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>So the current pace of the project is not very impressive (again, as a GIMP contributor, I’m biased) and I’m not sure how much we are going to see in 2021.</p>
<p>That said, I think having a whole new image editor based on GEGL would be lovely. I don’t see why Glimpse-NX couldn’t be that project. A proof-of-concept application that would load an image, apply a filter, and export it back sounds feasible. It’s something one could iterate upon. So maybe that’s how they are going to play it.</p>
<p>The fine folks over at <strong>Krita</strong> posted a <a href="https://krita.org/en/item/krita-in-2020/">2020 report</a> where they listed major challenges they will be facing this year: the completion of resources management rewrite that currently blocks v5.0 release, the port to Apple M1, the launching of a new development fund (akin to that of Blender), and more.</p>
<p>They also <a href="https://krita.org/en/item/krita-4-4-2-released/">have just released version 4.4.2</a> with mesh gradients, mesh transform tool, new gradient editor etc.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>I think it’s safe to say that we might see <strong>MyPaint</strong> 2.0.2 later this year with some new features and quite a few bugfixes. There haven’t been much groundbreaking development since 2.0.1 released in May 2020.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are nice new features available in GitHub forks and not all of them have been turned into pull requests. But some were. E.g. there’s a guy who added a <a href="https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/pull/685">perspective mode</a> with vanishing points and all, and it’s almost ready, although it’s been in the works for almost 5 years now.</p>
<p>The topic of fullscreen <strong>color management implementation in Wayland</strong> is back, and it’s <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/t/wayland-color-management/10804/508">a kinda frustrating story</a>. In a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>people who are now <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/14">working on this</a> (Collabora developers) seem to have little experience with color management but they appear to be motivated to hack on the code;</li>
<li>all the while people who have a crapload of experience with color management have had bad experience discussing this before, do not like the approach by the new team, and don’t seem excited to contribute to this new effort (Graeme’s spec proposal is <a href="https://www.argyllcms.com/waylandcm.xml.txt">still available</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>So we might end up with an implementation that is not suitable for professional work. At this point, there’s no telling what will happen. Personally, I keep an open mind about it, but the quality of conversations is not good in a way that there is no visible action in response to substantiated criticism. And so the conversation isn’t getting anyone any further.</p>
<p>Now that <strong>Inkscape</strong> 1.1 alpha is out for everyone to take for a spin, I’m positive we are not so far from the final release. There is <em>a lot</em> packed into the coming update, see the <a href="https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php?title=Release_notes/1.1">draft of the release notes</a>. I’m really looking forward to whatever they have planned for when 1.1 is out, there is still so much to do!</p>

<p>There will be another 1.5.x release of <strong>Scribus</strong> that has some new PDF importing features and includes a lot of small but refining UI changes, likely before April. Another release should follow later in the year.</p>
<p>They definitely don’t want major UI changes in the main development branch anymore until they release 1.6, and that sounds like wrapping up for the big release to me. Which means it’s only a matter of how many under-the-hood changes still need to happen.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time since I last looked at <strong><a href="https://sigil-ebook.com/">Sigil</a></strong>, mostly because I lost my Nook device some years ago and never got to ordering a replacement. Meanwhile, Sigil got better. Like, <em>really</em> better.</p>
<p>They came up with what seems to be a working solution for dealing with both EPUB2 and EPUB3 in the same application, they updated the UI just enough to be recognizable yet somehow nicer, and then they added some boring yet useful utility features.</p>
<p>I do like where Kevin Hendricks and Doug Massay are taking the project to. Version 1.5.0 will probably be out in the first half of 2021.</p>

<p>Thanks to Aurélien Pierre, the last few releases of <strong>darktable</strong> introduced a more articulated division between scene-referred and display-referred workflows, and it looks like more people are contributing to that effort now. There are also some interesting things going on in pull requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7909">color balance RGB filter</a> working in JzAzBz color space, with built-in gamut checking;</li>
<li>a new <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7669">diffusion module</a> to add or remove lens blur, hazing, blooming etc.;</li>
<li>a new <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7633">chromatic aberrations correction module</a> that sits in the right place of the modules chain and produces less halos than defringe;</li>
<li>there’s also a work-in-progress <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/7092">option to correct lens distortions</a> straight from the RAW Exif for camera vendors that write the distortion in there&nbsp;— I think I mentioned that one in one of the last weekly recaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something you can already play with if you build from Git:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new demosaicing method, Ratio Corrected Demosaicing (based on <a href="https://github.com/LuisSR/RCD-Demosaicing">this research</a>), is aimed at reducing pixel overshooting;</li>
<li>color calibration module can now create an ad-hoc internal color profile from a color checker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, the amount of contributions is getting large enough for maybe more than one major release a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are currently <a href="https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/milestone/9">63 bugs that need to be fixed</a> for <strong>RawTherapee</strong> 5.9 to be released. I can’t give you a ETA for it and I’m not sure anybody can. The project is very active, and if you ever came across its fans online, you probably admired how strongly they feel about RT being superior in processing quality and ease of use as compared to some other tools :)</p>

<p>The <strong>Siril</strong> team is planning to release version 0.99.8 soon and then hopefully v1.0. They’ve completely rewritten image conversion, revamped memory management, and added astrometry support (6 catalogs supported currently).</p>
<p><img src="https://librearts.org/2021/01/foss-in-2021-preview/siril-0-99-7.webp" alt="Siril 0.99.7"></p>
<h2 id="animation"><a aria-label="Permalink to Animation" title="Permalink to 'Animation'" href="#animation">Animation</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Synfig</strong> team is completing the migration from autotools to CMake, and their next step would be to make it possible to build the program with MS Visual Studio. The expectation is that more contributors would join then thanks to a lower threshold. After that, the rendering code really needs attention.</p>
<p>In 2020, <strong>VGC</strong> by Boris Dalstein was “pre-incubated” at the BIC de Montpellier startup incubator and additionally obtained a public grant from CNC-RIAM. This means Boris will be able to hire another developer to work on the project.</p>
<p>The situation with <strong>enve</strong> is… Well, complicated, I guess. In summer 2020, Maurycy Liebner announced that the development is <a href="https://twitter.com/enve2d/status/1290935844610682880">on hold due to health issues</a>. In December, he started pushing some commits to the public repository on GitHub again, not at the old rate though. So it’s unclear if he’s resuming the work.</p>
<p>I think it would help to have some sort of a framework for more people to contribute, even basic things like a roadmap and info for newly arrived developers.</p>

<h2 id="vfx"><a aria-label="Permalink to VFX" title="Permalink to 'VFX'" href="#vfx">VFX</a></h2>
<p>Natron is one of the projects that I find hard to speculate about. The only active developer right now is Ole-André Rodlie, and his most recent work currently lives in <a href="https://github.com/rodlie/Natron">his own GitHub fork</a>. He says he’ll soon start making pull requests to the upstream GitHub project (which, let’s be frank, is a bit like sending PRs to yourself).</p>
<p>There could be a few visual tweaks coming next but unlikely at the scale of a UI redesign that is <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/t/natron-ui-re-design-proposal/18313">being discussed on Pixls</a> since May 2020.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2021/01/foss-in-2021-preview/natron-mockup.webp" alt="Natron UI mockup"> 
</figure>

<p>However, the new website for the project, designed by the same contributor, has good chances to go live soon. How much that will help attracting new developers is hard to say. Probably not much, as projects like Natron really need full-time involvement (which I <a href="https://librearts.org/2018/11/the-demise-of-natron/">discussed at length</a> in 2018, and not much changed since then).</p>
<p>This is a rather sad turn of events, as it leaves us Blender as the only working free/libre node-based compositing solution (unless you count upcoming Olive 0.2 in). Ramen is long gone, and ButtleOFX developers gave up around 2017. And while I love Blender to pieces, the idea that it is the only option is somehow worrying.</p>
<h2 id="3d"><a aria-label="Permalink to 3D" title="Permalink to '3D'" href="#3d">3D</a></h2>
<p>Everything Nodes, new asset browser, Vulkan support in EEVEE, new character animation tools and more — <a href="https://www.blender.org/press/big-blender-projects-for-2021/">all work planned</a> for <strong>Blender</strong> in 2021 sounds great. There isn’t really much to add here, apart from mentioning that some of these things will be possible thanks to corporate funding.</p>
<p>Version 2.92 is expected in late February, with features like easily drawing 3D primitives, a whole bunch of sculpting improvements, tracing image sequences to Grease Pencil strokes, cryptomatte support in EEVEE, and so much more.</p>

<p>I’d be a damn fool if I left out <strong>Dust3D</strong>. Jeremy HU did a lot of experimenting in 2020, and this year, his plan is to merge a lot of that into the main program. He’ll do more experimenting with his <a href="https://github.com/huxingyi/autoremesher">quad remesher</a> first though.</p>

<p>It’s hard to stay in touch with friends. The only thing that has <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">worked for me</a> is <strong>scheduled, recurring calendar events</strong>.</p>



<ul><li>Every other Thursday night, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/25/my-wifes-holiday-costume-makeup/">my wife</a> and I hop on a Zoom with <a href="https://anchor.fm/jace-and-critter/">a friend</a> in Portland and chat for an hour or two. </li><li>Every Tuesday, I have a coffee chat scheduled with a former coworker of mine. </li><li>Every Saturday, my mom comes over for dinner.</li><li>Once a month, I catch up with an old friend who moved away.</li></ul>



<p>We remember because our <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/">calendars</a> remind us. We don’t have to think about <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">when we’ll hang out again</a>. There’s no <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">awkward</a> “we should do this again!” or “let me know when you’re available for lunch next week!” involved. <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/07/a-simple-process-beats-a-perfect-process/">It’s automatic</a>. I schedule it once and we are guaranteed to stay in touch.</p>



<p>If you’re thinking it’s weird to treat a friendship like a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/20/a-tiny-guide-to-sprint-planning-in-scrum/">sprint planning</a> meeting, then maybe you’re right. But it works. It’s worth a little weirdness to stay in touch with the people who matter to me. </p>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">Try it</a> if you’re <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/16/if-everyone-else-on-earth-disappeared-how-would-you-spend-your-time/">sad about losing touch</a> with people.</p>

    <div>
        <p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has completed a regulation permitting low volume motor vehicle manufacturers to begin selling replica cars that resemble vehicles produced at least 25 years ago. Congress enacted a DeLorean Motor Company-backed bill backed by the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) DeLorean Motor Company, and others into law in 2015, which streamlined requirements for small automakers, but implementation was delayed while awaiting the NHTSA regulations. Companies like DeLorean will now be able to apply for authorization to produce and sell vehicles under this program.</p>
<p>The recent release of the final rule document was unexpected, and we’re very pleased to see it finally happen. Still, four years overdue with no clear idea of when (or if!) these would ever be released did certainly keep us from putting too many eggs in that stainless steel basket, so to speak.</p>
<p>Some previous suppliers that we had lined up have gone out of business during the pandemic, others have been absorbed by larger companies that have made it clear low volume component production is not something they’re interested in pursuing. In that regard there will be a fair amount of work to be re-done. Perhaps worse, some “champions” we had at various suppliers have retired or moved on. In some cases this has left a void, where before there was a DeLorean fan, who rallied for us within their company and management.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain staffing candidates that were on our short-list have long since moved on in and while unemployment has increased during 2020, many of the specialized roles that we require are still hard to fill.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, in 2015 our planned engine had a life-cycle of emissions compliance through 2022. We had hoped to get into production by 2017 and get 3-4 years out of it before having to take on the engineering for a new powertrain. It’s believed that this engine has been extended through perhaps 2024 now, but it doesn’t seem like a good idea to plan around an engine so near its end-of-life.</p>
<p>That said, with EV’s becoming more mainstream, we’ve been considering switching to an all-electric as the future. It certainly makes for an easier path through emissions maze which still looms large over any internal combustion engine. While an electric Cobra or Morgan may be a little extreme for their potential market, we’ve already seen that an EV DeLorean – as we displayed at the 2012 New York International Auto Show – is not such an “out there” idea.</p>
<p>Most critically, financial markets have changed, and will change even more as the world navigates the continuing COVID crisis during the Biden administration. Will the financial support that we had lined up a few years ago to carry us through the final development and into production still be available?</p>
<p>As the automotive brand with likely the highest name recognition across all demographics in spite of not having a new product in 40 years, we still believe that none of the above is insurmountable and believe that others will see value in it, as well.</p>
<p>Stay tuned…</p>

<em>Posted to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25863846">HN</a>. Comments and discussion highly encouraged.</em></p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Introduction
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1">
<p>This will be a short example-based guide to (a) awk (b) gnuplot and (c) using
them in a script.</p>
<p>
I needed to graph some data based on the output of a command run a couple times.
So what better way to solve that five minute task than to spend an hour learning
awk &amp; gnuplot to automate it?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2">
<h2 id="headline-2">
The Problem
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2">
<p>I needed to compare how long a program says it takes with how long it <em>actually</em>
takes to execute. So I wanted to run it a couple times and produce a graph
of real vs reported times.</p>
<p>
To do this, we could use the <code>time</code> command to retrieve its 'real' time. My program
already prints (to stdout) the time it says it takes to complete. The output looks like
"Time = x", where x is some decimal number. I'll describe the <code>time</code> output later.
The final table that I want the script to produce should look something like this
(these are just random numbers):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Trial</th>
<th>Real Time</th>
<th>Printed Time</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>44</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>21</td>
<td>3.6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Awk
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3">
<div id="outline-container-headline-4">
<h3 id="headline-4">
Awk 101
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4">
<p>A good introduction is <a href="https://ferd.ca/awk-in-20-minutes.html">Awk in 20 minutes</a>, I'd recommend skimming through it.</p>
<p>
Awk is a text-processing language that revolves around <em>patterns</em> and <em>actions</em>.
Patterns are like regular expressions (e.g. <code>hello</code>, or <code>hello+</code> if you want one
or more 'o' characters), actions are just a list of statements (e.g. <code>{ print 1; }</code>).
All patterns are checked against every line, and there corresponding action
will be executed if there is a match.</p>
<p>
Here's an example of using awk to print 1 if some line of the input contains hello:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">echo hello | awk <span>'/hello/ {print 1;}'</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Note on zsh's time
</h3>
<p>I use zsh's <code>time</code> which has a slightly different format to bash. Also, both output
to stderr so you'll notice <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> which redirects stderr to stdout.</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Building The Table With Awk
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6">
<p>We're going to need variables, like an index to a for loop, to print
the 'trial number'. No problem, we can initialize one with the <code>-v</code>
option like so <code>awk -v j=1 [script]</code> (set j to 1).</p>
<p>
We can also ask awk to give us the nth word in the current line with
<code>$n</code>, where n is some integer.</p>
<p>
And that's basically all we need! Here is the script:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># "Time" will appear before "java" in my output (e.g. "Time ...\n java ...\n Time ...\n ...").</span>
<span># Also, substr used to remove the 's' character from time's output</span>
awk -v j<span>=</span><span>1</span> <span>'/Time/{printf("%d %s ", j++, $3)} /java/{printf("%s\n", substr($5, 1, length($5)-1))}'</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>I shall elaborate a little more.
My program could be run like <code>time ./java arg1 arg2 2&gt;&amp;1</code> which would produce 2 lines
of output, the first containing "Time = [integer]", the second containing the output
of <code>time</code>. So my awk script will either see "Time", where it will
print the index and integer, or it will print the real time after seeing "java".
Notice that I don't print a newline with the "Time" action (which will come first
in my output). So I can build a row from data that spans multiple lines (2 lines in
this case.) Also, my output doesn't have any lines that contain both "Time" and "java".</p>
<p>
When my program is run five times and the output is piped to that awk command, it produces
data like this:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">1 12.11 2.547
2 11.294 3.07
3 14.375 3.102
4 12.407 3.208
5 10.147 3.212</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Which is what we want for gnuplot.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7">
<h2 id="headline-7">
Gnuplot
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7">
<p>To plot our data, we could have two lines. One would use the second column for the y-axis, and the other
would use the third. Both use the first column (the trial number) for their x-axis<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>
To tell gnuplot to use two columns: <code>using 1:2</code> or <code>u 1:2</code> specifies column 1 to be on the x-axis
and column 2 on y. To plot one line, you'd use <code>p "data.dat" u 1:2 title "My Plot" w lp</code> (<code>w lp</code> means
make it a line plot), but we want two lines, and also to use this without gnuplot's interactive mode, so
here's the full command:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># data.dat is my file name, convention seems to end it with *.dat.</span>
SETUP_OUTPUT<span>=</span><span>"set terminal png size 500,500; set output 'blogplot.png';"</span>
PLOT_DATA<span>=</span><span>"p 'data.dat' u 1:2 title 'Real Time' w lp, 'data.dat' u 1:3 title 'Printed Time' w lp"</span>
gnuplot -e <span>"</span>$SETUP_OUTPUT<span> </span>$PLOT_DATA<span>"</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Which outputs to a png called <code>blogplot.png</code> when executed:
<img src="https://cyberchris.xyz/img/blogplot.png" alt="/img/blogplot.png" title="/img/blogplot.png"></p>
</div>

We’ve also committed to doing regular pentesting audits to ensure that we catch issues. We’ve refined our processes around resolving security issues while pushing through a handful of well-handled CVEs (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a>) over the past year. Also important, we’ve <strong>simplified the security model</strong> in Superset to a simpler set of atomic permissions to make it more comprehensive.</p><p>Because we wanted to make it easier for people to manage and share the objects they’re building in Superset, we’ve rebuilt the <strong>export/import </strong>functionality from the ground up. This allows organizations to manage and synchronize objects across environments, and for users to share the assets that they’ve built easily.</p><p>We’ve also completely redesigned our <strong>community website </strong> at <a href="https://superset.apache.org/">superset.apache.org</a> and made it the official hub for our fast growing community. All of the resources expected from a mature open source community can be found and contributed to there.</p><p><strong>Reporting</strong> and <strong>alerting</strong> has always been highly requested in the community, and 1.0 packs a solid implementation that can support most use cases. This enables periodic email delivery of reports, as well as an alerting system that can monitor your metrics arbitrary shifts and alert you as specified. We built an extensible system that we can expand to more delivery mechanisms and forecasting/alerting logic.</p><p><span><span>

As a project that had been incubating since 2016, we finally ironed out some minor licensing issues, prevented license-related regressions using <a href="https://fossa.com/">FOSSA</a>, and started publishing proper ASF releases on a regular cadence. We also actively worked towards fitting the <a href="https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html">Apache Project Maturity Model</a>, aligning with the governance model prescribed by the ASF and took action to grow the community in sustainable ways. The graduation formally recognizes that the community has complied with all the requirements, and operates at the high standard required by the ASF.</p><p>With 1680 PRs merged and 25+ <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asip">SIPs</a> (Superset Improvement Proposals) over 2020, it’s hard to summarize what went into this release. Improvements happened in all aspects of the project, from infrastructure to design, through backend and frontend, to community and governance. Here are some <strong>honorable mentions</strong> that we haven’t been covered above, but deserve a mention in this post:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11499">Asynchronous backend improvements</a></li><li>Metadata and data pane in explorer view</li><li>Toolbars redesign (SQL Lab, dashboard, explore)</li><li>Date range picker redesign</li><li>Various Docker / Helm improvements</li><li>Migration of key visualization to plugins using <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/">Echarts</a></li><li>Time series forecasting leveraging the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">Prophet</a> library</li><li>Improvements to and extensive use of our feature flag framework</li><li>Improved analytics logging, capturing more events more consistently</li><li>Exploration control panels improvements</li><li>Improved SQL-to-explore flows</li></ul><p>All-in-all, Superset has come a long way recently and this release marks the project entering its mature stage.

    <div>
      
<p>In this tutorial, we'll build a steganography tool in Python. Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other data. Unlike encryption, where the goal is to secure <em>the contents</em> of communication between two parties, steganography aims to obscure the fact that the parties are communicating at all.</p>
<p>Our tool will enable the user to hide secret text within a normal-looking <code>.png</code> image file. The receiver of the image will use the same tool to reveal the hidden message.</p>
<p>We'll use Python to build the tool. The most popular Python image processing libraries are <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/">Pillow</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/">OpenCV</a>, but these are heavy libraries with many dependencies. We'll avoid these and instead use the lightweight <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pypng/">PyPNG</a> library which is written in pure Python, and therefore easier to run on various platforms.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-background-on-steganography">A quick background on steganography</h2>
<p>Let's imagine three people: Alice, Bob and Eve. Alice wants to send a private message to Bob, while Eve wants to intercept this message. While modern-day encryption can help Alice and Bob ensure that Eve doesn't know the <em>contents</em> of their message, Eve can possibly still deduce interesting information just from knowing that Alice and Bob are communicating at all, and how frequently they communicate.</p>
<p>To obscure the communication channel completely, Alice and Bob can exploit the fact that hundreds of millions of photos are uploaded and shared across the internet daily. Instead of communicating directly, Alice can leave her message hidden in an image at a pre-agreed location and Bob can access this message. From Eve's perspective, there is now no direct communication between the two.</p>
<p>A single image is made up of millions of pixels. While many formats exist, a pixel is most simply represented by a group of three numbers between 0 and 255, one number each for the red, blue, and green values of that pixel. Using this Red-Green-Blue scheme we can represent any colour in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB color model</a>.</p>
<p>Digital text, like images, is also represented internally by numbers, so the differences between a text file and an image file are not as large as you might assume. Any digital data can be represented as a <a href="https://thehelloworldprogram.com/computer-science/what-is-binary/">binary string</a>, a bunch of 1s and 0s, and we can make tiny modifications to an image to encode a binary string within it. As an example, consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>image = [, , ]</code></pre>
<p>This is a representation of an image with three pixels: one red, one green, and one blue. If we encode this as an image and open it in an image viewer, we'll see the three pixel image, but if we read this data with Python, it is simply a list of tuples, each containing three integers.</p>
<p>We could also look at each value making up each pixel and calculate whether it is <em>odd</em> or <em>even</em>. We could encode odd numbers as <code>1</code> and even values as <code>0</code>. This would give us the binary string "100 010 001" (as the 255 values are odd and the 0s are even).</p>
<p>If we made a small modification to the image as follows:</p>
<pre><code>image = [, , ]</code></pre>
<p>The image would look almost identical in any image viewer (we have just added or subtracted a minuscule amount of color from some values), but the binary string -- using our odd/even method -- would look completely different: "011 111 100". </p>
<p>Using this technique but extending it over an entire image (millions of pixels), we can hide a large amount of text data in any image.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-project-on-replit">Creating the project on Repl.it</h2>
<p>If you were serious about keeping your messages as secret as possible, you'd want to do all of these steps on an offline computer that you fully control. As a learning exercise though, we'll set the project up on <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>. Navigate to their site and sign up for an account if you don't have one.</p>
<p>Create a new project, choosing "Python" as the language, and give your project a name.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.repl.it/images/tutorials/13-steganography/04-create-repl.png" alt="Creating a new repl"></p>
<p>The first piece we need to build is a function to encode any text message as a binary string.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-a-text-message-as-a-binary-string">Encoding a text message as a binary string</h2>
<p>Open the <code>main.py</code> file and add the following code</p>
<pre><code>import base64

def encode_message_as_bytestring(<span>message</span>):
    b64 = <span>message</span>.encode(<span>"utf8"</span>)
    bytes_ = base64.encodebytes(b64)
    bytestring = <span>""</span>.jo<span>in(</span>[<span>"{:08b}"</span>.<span>format</span>(<span>x</span>) for <span>x</span> <span>in</span> bytes_])
    <span>return</span> bytestring</code></pre>
<p>This first encodes our text as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a> and then as a binary string. You can add some print statements to see how the message is transformed in the different steps, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.repl.it/images/tutorials/13-steganography/13-01-encode-binstring.png" alt="Encoding a message as a binary string"></p>
<p>The base64 step is not strictly necessary, but it is useful as any file or data can be encoded as base64. This opens our project up to future extensions such as hiding other kinds of files within image files instead of just text strings.</p>
<h2 id="adding-an-end-of-message-delimeter">Adding an 'end of message' delimeter</h2>
<p>We'll assume that our message will always 'fit' in our image. We can fit three binary digits per pixel (one for each of the RGB values), so our resulting binary string should be shorter than the the number of pixels in the image multiplied by three.</p>
<p>We'll also need to know when the message <em>ends</em>. The message will only be encoded in the beginning of the image file, but if we don't know how long the message is, we'll keep looking at normal pixels and trying to encode them as text data. Let's add an "end of string" delimiter to the end of our message: this should be something that wouldn't appear half way through our actual message by chance. We'll use the binary representation of '!ENDOFMESSAGE!' for this.</p>
<p>Modify your function to look as follows, which adds this delimeter at the end.</p>
<pre><code>import <span>base64
</span>
ENDOFMESSAGE = <span>"0100100101010101010101100100111101010010010001010011100101000111010101000101010101010110010101000101010100110000010001100100100001010010010100110100010100111101"</span>

def encode_message_as_bytestring(message):
    <span>b64 </span>= message.encode(<span>"utf8"</span>)
    <span>bytes_ </span>= <span>base64.encodebytes(b64)
</span>    <span>bytestring </span>= <span>""</span>.<span>join(["{:08b}".format(x) </span>for x in <span>bytes_])
</span>    <span>bytestring </span>+= ENDOFMESSAGE
    return <span>bytestring</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we can handle some basic text encoding, let's look at images.</p>
<h2 id="getting-pixels-from-an-image">Getting pixels from an image</h2>
<p>Find a PNG image somewhere - either one you've taken yourself or from a site like unsplash. You can use any online JPG to PNG converter if you only have <code>.jpg</code> files available.</p>
<p>Upload your PNG file by clicking on the three dot menu in the repl sidebar, in the top right corner of the files pane to the left, and selecting <code>upload file</code> or by simply dragging and dropping your file within the files pane.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.repl.it/images/tutorials/13-steganography/05-upload-file.png" alt="Image showing file upload"></p>
<p>We're going to write a function that extracts the raw pixel data from this image file. Add an import to the top of the file.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> png</code></pre>
<p>And then add a new function to the bottom of <code>main.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_pixels_from_image</span><span>(fname)</span></span>:
    img = png.Reader(fname).read()
    pixels = img[<span>2</span>]
    <span>return</span> pixels</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read()</code> method returns a 4‑tuple consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>width: Width of PNG image in pixels</li>
<li>height: Height of PNG image in pixels</li>
<li>rows: A sequence or iterator for the row data</li>
<li>info: An info dictionary containing some meta data</li>
</ul>
<p>We are primarily interested in the third item, "rows", which is an iterator containing all the pixels of the image, row by row. If you're not familiar with Python generators take a look at <a href="https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/">this guide</a>, but they are essentially memory-efficient lists.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-the-image-with-the-message">Encoding the image with the message</h2>
<p>Now that we have the encoded message and pixels of the image ready we can combine them to form our secret encoded image.</p>
<p>Add the following function to the bottom of the <code>main.py</code> file. This function takes in the outputs from the previous functions (our raw pixels and our message encoded as a binary string), and combines them.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>encode_pixels_with_message</span>(<span>pixels, bytestring</span>):</span>
    <span>'''modifies pixels to encode the contents from bytestring'''</span>

    enc_pixels = []
    string_i = <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> row <span>in</span> pixels:
        enc_row = []
        <span>for</span> i, char <span>in</span> <span>enumerate</span>(row):
            <span>if</span> string_i &gt;= <span>len</span>(bytestring):
                pixel = row[i]
            <span>else</span>:
                <span>if</span> row[i] % <span>2</span> != <span>int</span>(bytestring[string_i]):
                    <span>if</span> row[i] == <span>0</span>:
                        pixel = <span>1</span>
                    <span>else</span>:
                        pixel = row[i] - <span>1</span>
                <span>else</span>:
                    pixel = row[i]
            enc_row.append(pixel)
            string_i += <span>1</span>

        enc_pixels.append(enc_row)
    <span>return</span> enc_pixels</code></pre>
<p>This is the most complicated part of our project, but most of the code is there to handle edge cases. The important insight is that we want to control whether each pixel has an odd value (representing a 1 in our binary string) or an even one (to represent a 0). By chance, half of the pixel values will already have the correct value.</p>
<p>We simply loop through the binary string and the pixel and 'bump' each value that isn't correct by one. That is, we subtract 1 from the value if we need to change it from odd to even or vice versa. We don't want any negative numbers, so if we need to change any of the <code>0</code> values, we add 1 instead.</p>
<h3 id="writing-our-modified-pixels-back-to-an-image">Writing our modified pixels back to an image</h3>
<p>We now have all the image data, including the encoded message but it is still just a list of pixels. Let's add a function that will compile our pixels back into a PNG image.</p>
<p>Add the following function to the bottom of the <code>main.py</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>def write<span>_pixels_to_image(<span>pixels</span>, <span>fname</span>)</span>:
    png.from<span>_array(<span>pixels</span>, 'RGB')</span>.save(fname)</code></pre>
<p>The above function takes the array <code>pixels</code> and uses the <code>png</code> module to write these to a brand new <code>.png</code> file.</p>
<p>Play around with these functions to make sure you understand how they work. Before we write some wrapper code to actually use these, we're going to do everything backwards so that we can also extract hidden messages from previously encoded PNG files.</p>
<h2 id="decoding-messages-from-image-files">Decoding messages from image files</h2>
<p>First we need a function that can turn a binary string back into readable text. As before, we'll go via base64 for better compatability. Add the following function to the bottom of the <code>main.py</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>def decode<span>_message_from_bytestring(<span>bytestring</span>)</span>:
    bytestring = bytestring.split(ENDOFMESSAGE)<span>[<span>0</span>]</span>
    message = <span>int</span>(bytestring, <span>2</span>).<span>to</span><span>_bytes(<span>len</span>(<span>bytestring</span>)</span> 
    message = base64.decodebytes(message).decode(<span>"utf8"</span>)
    return message</code></pre>
<p>Remember how we added a special <code>E…</code></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h4>Introduction</h4><p>Escrow is a payment setup where the payer sends funds to a third party rather than directly to the payee. If certain conditions are met, the third party routes the funds to the recipient; if not, the funds get returned to the sender. Escrow is particularly useful for high value payments because the payer is guaranteed their money back if the payee doesn’t meet the conditions.</p><p>Many Americans encounter escrow when they buy or sell a home. In the US, the final step in buying a home is referred to as the “closing process.” While it can vary from state to state, the basic premise is that the buyer delivers the funds to a third party, the seller signs over the deed (or title) to the property, and that third party then transfers the funds to the seller once all the documents are complete. The third party is often referred to as a “title and escrow agent.”</p><p>This post takes the sale of a residential home and walks through how to build the flow of funds associated with the escrow process. We hope this guide is useful in demystifying how an escrow company might automate its payment operations using Modern Treasury.</p><h4>The User Experience</h4><p>Let’s say you’re building a title and escrow company in the US that helps clients sell their homes online. The user experience steps might look something like this:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Billie Buyer commits to buying a house. Billie will make a 20% down payment in cash and will take out a mortgage for the remaining 80%. </li><li>You assign an escrow bank account to the transaction, collect the two incoming wire transfers from Billie Buyer and the lender, and inform the seller when the funds are in your possession.</li><li>At that point, Sandy Seller signs over the property.</li><li>Once you’ve determined all the documentation is completed correctly, you disburse the full purchase amount to Sandy Seller via wire transfer. </li></ol><p>The flow of funds is straightforward: two incoming wire transfers, and one outgoing wire transfer. This can get significantly more complicated if there are multiple sources of funds, or if there are other parties to be paid, such as tax authorities or other settlement agents. But for the sake of clarity, we’ll start with this simple scenario.</p><h4>Payment Ops Architecture<br></h4><p>To start, you should decide on the account structure itself. Escrow accounts have specific legal designations at banks and not all banks offer them. In addition, you should decide whether to use a single bank account for multiple transactions or to use virtual accounts.<br></p><p><a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/docs/virtual-accounts" target="_blank">Virtual accounts</a> are accounts with unique account numbers within a physical bank account. They are much faster to provision than real bank accounts and guarantee one-to-one reconciliation. For our architecture, using virtual accounts as escrow accounts is ideal because we can create one account per house sale. This helps us segregate funds in our reconciliation, as opposed to mixing the funds of multiple house sales in a single account. Also, single transactions per virtual account create a more manageable audit trail.<br></p><figure id="w-node-18dd9f1739d7-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/6009051bee1c4e7860a4289f_Escrow%20Journal%20Post%20Diagram.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><h4>API Calls and Timings</h4><p>With our payment ops architecture in hand, we’re ready to build. <br></p><h5>Step 1: Assign a Virtual Account to a sale and share numbers with Buyer and Lender</h5><p>As soon as you learn of an impending house sale, you create a virtual account and share its details with Billie Buyer. You might also generate an invoice for Billie Buyer to share with their mortgage lender, along with specific instructions as to the amount and breakdown to be included in the wires.<br></p><p>To do so, you’d make an Modern Treasury API request like the following:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br> &nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br> &nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/virtual_accounts \<br> &nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br> &nbsp;-d '{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Sale of 123 Main Street",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"internal_account_id": "c743edb7-4059-496a-94b8-06fc081156fd",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"account_details": [<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"account_number": "2000001",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"account_number_type": "other"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br> &nbsp;}'</h6><p><em>‍</em>The response includes the unique routing details for the newly created account. &nbsp;You might also want to add additional information about the sale in the account’s metadata, for example: details about the buyer, seller, property in question, expected close date, any unique arrangements, and other information.</p><h5>Step 2: Create Expected Payments to monitor the wires you expect to receive<br></h5><p>Though not required, it’s useful to create Expected Payments for the two incoming wires you expect to receive. This way, Modern Treasury will notify your system via webhook whether a given payment succeeds within your specified time range, or if it is overdue:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br> &nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br> &nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/expected_payments \<br> &nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br> &nbsp;-d '{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"description": "Sale of 123 Main Street (Billie’s Portion)",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"internal_account_id": "c743edb7-4059-496a-94b8-06fc081156fd",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"virtual_account_id": "virtual-account-id",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"amount_upper_bound": 6000000,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"amount_lower_bound": 6000000,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"date_upper_bound": "2021-01-15"<br> &nbsp;}'</h6><p><em>‍</em>Some banks will notify you in advance of a payment settling in an account. Modern Treasury captures that notification in the form of an Incoming Payment Detail object. Subscribing to Incoming Payment Detail <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#incoming-payment-details" target="_blank">webhooks</a> will be the first indication from the bank that the wires will settle soon.</p><h5>Step 3: Disburse funds </h5><p>Once the funds have arrived and the documents have been signed, you can disburse the total amount due to Sandy Seller. Let’s say Sandy Seller is getting $300,000 in net proceeds, which will go out via a single wire. Note that the amount is in cents, not dollars, so it is presented as 30000000:</p><h6>‍<br>curl --request POST \<br> &nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br> &nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/payment_orders \<br> &nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br> &nbsp;-d '{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"description": "Sale of 123 Main Street (Sandy’s Payout)",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"type": "wire",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"amount": 30000000,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"currency": "USD",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"originating_account": "virtual-account-id",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"receiving_account_id": "sandy-external-account-id",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"counterparty_id": "sandy-counterparty-id"<br> &nbsp;}'</h6><p><em>‍</em>Once the payment goes through, the account will be debited $300,000 and the transaction will be complete.</p><p>Lastly, you want to add <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#metadata" target="_blank">metadata</a> to the payment for future reference. In addition to metadata tags (eg. key value pairs such as Type: Residential or State: Colorado) you might also attach the PDF for the legal docs, or the CSV calculating the amounts. This will be useful for finance teams that might have questions about this payment in the future.</p><p>That’s it. You have just built a sophisticated payment ops architecture for a house sale with a few API calls.</p><div><p>In reality, of course, things can be more elaborate. Billie Buyer could have multiple sources of funds for the down payment, as they may be receiving funds from family or from a service like <a href="http://haus.com/" target="_blank">Haus</a>. They may also be working with multiple lenders if they have a second mortgage. And depending on the state and county the house is located in, the escrow company may have to disburse funds for sales tax or other fees.</p></div><h4>What Can Go Wrong?</h4><p>Payment operations software, such as <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/" target="_blank">Modern Treasury</a>, can manage not only the happy path as described above but also edge cases when things go wrong. A common issue could be that a seller could mistype their bank account details, causing the payment to be returned. Modern Treasury supports account verification with providers like <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/docs/plaid-integration-guide" target="_blank">Plaid</a>, so both you and the seller can be confident that funds are routed to the right destination.</p><p>Customer service issues are another type of problem that can arise, such as when a lender sends the incorrect amount. In that case, there might be an additional transaction necessary or an explanatory note for future audits. Modern Treasury supports tracking funds using double-entry <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/docs/ledgers-overview" target="_blank">Ledgers</a>. This way, ops teams can refer to an immutable history of the transaction data, since all money movements are captured and displayed. In the future, accountants and auditors won’t be left wondering about a wire, since contextual information will be tied to the bank statement transaction in question.<br></p><h4>More?</h4><p>This post laid out a simple yet robust foundation for payment ops at an escrow company, leaving plenty of room for future functionality. </p><p>For any specific questions, or to see how Modern Treasury can help make your company’s payment ops simple, scalable, and secure, <a href="https://app.moderntreasury.com/sign_up" target="_blank">sign up today</a>.<br><em>Note: Modern Treasury empowers teams to make payment operations simple, scalable, and secure.

<h4><strong>Drive prediction @ Datto</strong></h4>
<p>	We’ve all had a hard drive fail on us, and often it’s as sudden as booting your machine and realizing you can’t access a bunch of your files. It’s not a fun experience. It’s especially not fun when you have an entire data center full of drives that are all important to keeping your business running. What if we could predict when one of those drives would fail, and get ahead of it by preemptively replacing the hardware before the data is lost? This is where the history of predictive drive failure at Datto begins.</p>
<p>	First and foremost, to make a prediction you need data. Hard drives have a built-in utility called SMART<em> (</em><strong><em>S</em></strong><em>elf-</em><strong><em>M</em></strong><em>onitoring, </em><strong><em>A</em></strong><em>nalysis and </em><strong><em>R</em></strong><em>eporting </em><strong><em>T</em></strong><em>echnology)</em> that reports an array of statistics about how the drive is functioning. Here’s an abbreviated view of what that looks like:<br></p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/smart_file_sample.png" alt=""></figure><p>	Datto collects a report like this from each hard drive in its storage servers once per day. Each attribute in the report has three important numbers associated with it: value, thresh, and worst. Each attribute also has a feature named raw_value, but this is discarded due to inconsistent reporting standards between drive manufacturers. </p>
<p>	<strong>Value:</strong> A number between 1 and 253, inclusive. The value reflects how well the drive is operating with respect to the attribute, with 1 being the worst and 253 being the best. The initial value is arbitrarily determined by the manufacturer, and can vary by drive model. </p>
<p>	<strong>Thresh: </strong>A threshold below which the value should not fall in normal operation. If the value falls below the threshold, there is likely something wrong with the drive.</p>
<p>	<strong>Worst: </strong>A record of the lowest value ever recorded for the attribute.</p>
<p>	A quick approach to using these values to make useful predictions is to pick a couple of attributes that seem important and make an alert if any of their values pass below the associated threshold. This is how the first iteration of predictive drive failure at Datto worked. It wasn’t perfect, but it was definitely better than nothing!</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/code_snippet_1.png" alt=""></figure><p>The next iteration of drive failure prediction was assigning a weighted health score to each drive. This score was defined by assigning weight to several different attributes based on how severe they appeared to be, then adding them together. This prediction method was better than its predecessor, but could potentially be improved even further.</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/code_snippet_2.png" alt=""></figure><p>This brings us to the most recent iteration of drive failure prediction at Datto and the topic of this article: <strong>smarterCTL</strong>, a machine learning model using most attributes reported by SMART to make the most informed prediction possible. <code>Smartctl</code> is the command line utility used to collect SMART reports. SmarterCTL is a machine learning model making use of <code>smartctl</code>, so it’s the smart-ER version of it. Yeah, it’s a bad pun, but I’m an engineer not a comedian.</p>
<h4><strong>Machine learning &amp;&amp; SMART</strong></h4>
<p>Before we get into the details of smarterCTL, let’s briefly go over machine learning. At its core, machine learning is the process of applying statistics to a dataset to find patterns in it. Once the patterns are found, they can be applied to new data to make assumptions about what that new data means. The defining feature of machine learning is that the programmer doesn’t have any input in figuring out the patterns in the data; the algorithm does that on its own through trial and error. For a great high level introduction to how machine learning works, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_uwKZIAeM0">this</a> two minute video. </p>
<p>	To get a feel for workflow and terminology, let’s walk through a simplified application of machine learning on drive failure prediction. This example glosses over details and makes some leaps of logic to keep the scope broad. For a more accurate look under the hood of decision tree-based machine learning models, check out this <a href="https://e2eml.school/how_decision_trees_work.html">article</a> and the other resources linked throughout this section.</p>
<p>To make predictions, we need a dataset to train the model on. In this case, the data points are hard drives and the features of those data points are the attributes SMART provides.</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/datapoint_example.png" alt=""></figure><p>	These data points are labelled as members of the negative or positive class, which in this case means “hard drive operates normally” or “hard drive has failed.” Note that the “positive” in “positive class” doesn’t mean “good.” Instead, it means “this sample exhibits the behavior we’re looking out for.” A machine learning model would read this dataset, then look for patterns in the features that determine why each hard drive ended up in its class.</p>
<p>Normally there would be enough data points and features that a human couldn’t read the whole dataset—let alone spot a pattern in it! This example is simplified enough for us to step through the process that a model might follow. Let’s look for a pattern in each feature:</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/seek_error_rate.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Nothing to see here, neither class is homogeneous when it comes to seek_error_rate.<br></p>

<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/spin_up_time.png" alt=""></figure><p>Again, we can’t make a determination based on this attribute alone. There isn’t an obvious split, like high numbers being good and low numbers being bad.</p>

<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/power_on_hours.png" alt=""></figure><p>This time it looks like there is a pattern! Drives with high power-on hours are healthy and drives with low power-on hours will fail. This doesn’t make logical sense though—a drive with low power-on hours should be the healthiest, since it’s the closest to mint condition. Let’s look a little deeper, and see if we can find a correlation between this feature and another that tells us something more logical. </p>

<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/spin_up_over_poh.png" alt=""></figure><p>A-ha! There’s still a difference in magnitude between the two classes, but this time there’s an explanation for it that makes sense: an older drive with a high spin-up time is aging and degrading normally, while a very young drive with a high spin-up time indicates that there might be something like a factory defect.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve figured out the pattern, let’s see how our theoretical model would classify these new SMART reports:</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/unclassified.png" alt=""></figure><p>	The ratio of spin-up time over power-on hours for drive X is 0.0002, which indicates that it will remain healthy. The ratio for drive Y is 0.045, pointing toward failure.<br>	So how do we know if the model made correct predictions? Well, we just have to wait and see. One of the trickier parts of this problem space is verifying results, because the whole point is to allow us to take action before the thing we’re predicting ever happens. Keep this in mind, it’ll come back to bite us later.</p>
<p>SmarterCTL’s job is to classify hard drives as “failing” or “not failing” so Datto can avoid being blindsided by lost drives and preemptively swap them for healthy ones. If there are patterns in SMART stats that indicate drive failure, smarterCTL will learn those patterns from SMART data Datto has collected over the past 3 years. Then smarterCTL can monitor new daily SMART reports and produce an alert when a drive is exhibiting a pattern that indicates failure.</p>

<h2><strong>Act 2 - Data preparation</strong></h2>
<p>We have several hundred gigabytes of SMART files spanning 3 years and a relatively beefy server to train a machine learning model on—the next step is to set it up and let it churn through the data, right? Unfortunately the work has just begun. Even though machine learning models have a reputation for taking days, or even weeks to train, preparing the data is often the most time consuming part of the process! </p>
<p>	Software folks know that computers are “dumb” and will only do exactly what they’re instructed to. Therefore, the data fed into a machine learning model needs to be very carefully curated. The model has no intuition about whether the conclusions it’s coming to are logical or not, so data that doesn’t accurately describe the whole problem space will lead to a model that confidently spouts nonsense.</p>
<p>In machine learning, the job of the programmer isn’t to spot the patterns in the data: it’s to spot the antipatterns that the model might fall into along the way. Good data treatment and preparation are the first steps in avoiding those antipatterns. </p>
<h4><strong>Shaping the data</strong></h4>
<p>The first step is turning the human readable SMART reports into something more machine readable.</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/sample_smart_data_1.png" alt=""></figure><p>	I condensed all of the data in each day of smart reports into its own csv file, but some key information was still missing. Since this data will be used to train a model, every data point needs to have a class label associated with it—the model needs to know whether these are healthy or failed drives so it can start to learn about potential patterns. </p>
<p>Producing the class labels ended up being a little tricky—if a drive is in poor enough health to be a member of the failing class, it might already be failing badly enough to not report SMART stats. To get a clearer idea of how drives were behaving and when they were failing out, I wrote a script that walked through every day of SMART reports and tracked how and when each drive failed. </p>
<p>Our servers use the filesystem ZFS, which pools together storage devices into groups called “zpools”. The zpool reports a health status for each drive in the pool. When my script comes across a failing zpool status for a drive, it notes on which day the failure occurred then goes through every daily csv and adds the following features to that drive’s row:</p>
<ol><li>Whether this drive ever fails (class label)</li><li>If so, in how many days from this csv’s date the failure would occur, and</li><li>The zpool status associated with the failure</li></ol><p>With the addition of those features, our data now looks like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://datto.engineering/DBImg/sample_smart_data_2.png" alt=""></figure><p>	At this point the dataset is a collection of csv files, one per day, that contain:</p>
<ul><li>One row per drive</li><li>The SMART data reported by each drive on that day</li><li>Whether each drive is currently failed</li><li>Whether each drive ever failed while we tracked it</li></ul><p>	Seems like enough data to start making predictions, right? Well, kind of! At this point, the data is well-formed enough that a model could understand it and start producing predictions. The quality of those predictions would be poor, though; the data needs a lot more treatment to remove the pitfalls lurking within.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Cleaning the data</strong></h4>
<p>	Right now, the data is well formed but messy. It’s in the right shape, …</p></div></div>

<h3>Piracy in the pandemic</h3>



<p>The pandemic may have stopped many from going to the cinema, but that doesn’t mean people didn’t watch films in 2020. Whether through streaming services like Netflix or old-fashioned TV channels and DVDs, there are still many ways to enjoy films at home.</p>



<p>And, of course, there’s always piracy.</p>



<p>According to London-based company Muso, which tracks copyright infringement in 196 countries, visits to sites hosting pirated streams of films increased <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6347345/Has%20the%20displaced%20cinema%20audience%20become%20the%20new%20piracy%20audience.pdf?utm_campaign=COVID-19%20Protect%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=89190861&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fsAlLpaO7ia-oGXZtShQz3YvarSVxz-MOcRsd6n-2MdwgaqkuJst2pleQF6wqtV2M9iKJJrEHjfzWrF6zIi64vzWBy6G_Y04I0aTFZKM8_SzKuys&amp;utm_content=89190861&amp;utm_source=hs_automation">as much as 90%</a> in some countries during the first few months of the pandemic. The company provided<em> Rest of World</em> with its list of the top 50 foreign films accessed via illegal streaming sites from January to October last year.</p>



<p>Predictably, many of the films are from the last two years. One notable exception? “The Flu,” a 2013 film about a lethal, airborne virus that infects a South Korean city. But which films made the top ten?</p>



<h2 id="attraction-2-invasion">Attraction 2: Invasion</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Russia<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 12/19/2019</p>

</p></figure>



<p>An ordinary girl becomes the object of study after she gains superpowers from exposure to extraterrestrial technology in this film from Russian director Fyodor Bondarchuk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Invasion” picks up where the 2017 film “Attraction” left off, after an alien ship has crash-landed in a Russian city. Exposed to alien technology, Julia is brought into a secret government lab to be studied. After gaining superpowers that threaten not only humans but also extraterrestrial life, Julia has to decide which side she is on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the film has not been widely reviewed in Western media outlets, the entertainment website <a href="https://www.eclecticpop.com/2020/12/movie-review-does-attraction-2-invasion-vtorzhenie-satisfy-as-a-sequel.html">Eclectic Pop</a> noted that “the sequel avoids the mind-numbing quality of its genre peers to provide something captivating,” providing a worthy sequel to its predecessor. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8060328/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$15.9 million</a> worldwide.</p>



<h2 id="baaghi-3">Baaghi 3</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In this 2020 Indian action thriller directed by Ahmed Khan, the third in a series of loosely related films, a man with chiseled abs saves his elder brother from Syrian terrorists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ronnie’s rescue mission is a display of punches, explosions, and acrobatics, often shown in slow motion, “but none of it can rise beyond a weak script that doesn’t go for the kill,” the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/baaghi-3/movie-review/74503018.cms"><em>Times of India </em>wrote</a>. Ronnie, played by Indian actor Tiger Shroff, beats up men, cars, tanks, and helicopters, mostly shirtless. “He bounces off buildings, treads on air; delivers triple roundhouse kicks and does devastating stuff with his hands and feet,” the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/baaghi-3-movie-review-tiger-shroff-saves-syria-but-not-sanity/story-wrmhhjpvtV40GFYOsZCsUI.html"><em>Hindustan Times </em>wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the film attempts to reach beyond Bollywood cliches, one trope remains: demonizing Muslims as villains. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8366590/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$16.7 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="sputnik">Sputnik</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Russia<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Drama<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 9/10/2020</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Two Russian cosmonauts return to Earth from a research mission in 1983, but their spacecraft malfunctions on the way home. Only one crew member, Konstantin Sergeyevich, survives. But he is not alone. Konstantin’s body houses a slimy, spindly creature that is dormant during the day, in his stomach. At night, it climbs out of his body in search of human flesh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reviewer Matt Zoller Seitz says a “very Russian vibe of <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sputnik-movie-review-2020">soulful heaviness</a>” sets the film apart. Rather than give up his dream of space travel, Konstantin, whose spouse passed away before the journey, put his son in an orphanage. When he returns to Earth, Konstantin must confront his responsibility. Though “Sputnik” is about an alien, it focuses heavily on humans: how and where our weak points are, how we can be manipulated, and how our biology can fail us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Released in the middle of a pandemic, “Sputnik” grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt11905962/?ref_=bo_se_r_2">$307,062</a> at the box office worldwide and was shown as part of the <a href="https://tribecafilm.com/films/sputnik-2020">Tribeca Film Festival</a>.</p>



<h2 id="one-piece-stampede">One Piece: Stampede</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Japan<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Animation<br><strong>Release date: </strong>8/9/2019</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s probably no surprise that this anime film is on the list, as it’s based on one of the most popular Japanese manga series of all time: “One Piece,” by Eiichiro Oda. It is the 14th film in the franchise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pirates from around the world gather at a festival where they race to an island containing the legendary lost treasure of Gol D. Roger, king of the pirates. The race quickly unravels into fantasy violence, which the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-10-23/one-piece-stampede-review-anime"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> called “nonstop mayhem” — explosions, fistfights, earthquakes, and naval bombardments dart across the screen with colorful special effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luffy, the protagonist of the series, teams up with his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates. They face off against Bullet, who hopes to make his name as the strongest pirate, the new king, and someone who relies on only himself. Luffy, like all good role models, values friendship and teamwork. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt9430698/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$81.6 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="son-of-a-richnbsp">Son of a Rich&nbsp;</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Here’s a comedic plot for the ages: an oligarch’s pampered son is tricked into believing that he has traveled through time to become a serf in a 19th-century village, in a bid to rehabilitate his appalling behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grigory’s family is so wealthy, he believes that he is above the law. He parties hard, gets into trouble, and scoffs in the face of authority. One day, he goes too far — and so his father, as one does, buys a large tract of land and hires a group of actors to create a 19th-century village. His son gets into an orchestrated fake car accident and wakes up in the village, believing that he’s traveled back through time. Watched by a network of hidden cameras (and a team of psychologists), the oligarch watches his son discard his privileged ways and learn the value of hard work.</p>



<p>Clearly, this relatable tale of redemption struck a chord with people: the Russian comedy directed by Klim Shipenko grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt11418452/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$43.8 million</a> and was one of the most pirated films of the year.</p>



<h2 id="recep-vedik-6">Recep İvedik 6</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Turkey<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Comedy<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 11/7/2019</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Recep, a man with a unibrow and a penchant for slapping people in the face, has misadventures in Kenya, in this Turkish slapstick comedy, directed by Togan Gökbakar.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Recep_%C4%B0vedik_6?id=3sJ0zlYkZME.P&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Recep İvedik</a> is at home watching television, when the mailman delivers him an invitation to a dried beans festival in Turkey’s Konya province. But instead of getting plane tickets to Konya, Recep and his best friend Nurullah end up on a flight to Kenya.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recep and Nurullah join a safari tour. A series of escalating comical escapades ensue, with everything from close encounters with the local wildlife to mediating a dispute between two tribes. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt7399138/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$17 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="peninsula">Peninsula</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> South Korea<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Thriller<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 7/15/2020</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVucSRLLeIM?feature=oembed" title="TRAIN TO BUSAN PRESENTS: PENINSULA (2020) Official Teaser | Zombie Action Movie" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The 2016 zombie thriller “Train to Busan” was met with universal critical acclaim and became one of the films that marked South Korea’s rise as a cinematic power. Peninsula, however, is another example of a sequel that doesn’t live up to the original.</p>



<p>“A sequel was inevitable, and despite some truly white-knuckle car chases and creative lighting, <em>Peninsula,</em> like many films that jump on the surprise hit bandwagon, proves lightning in a bottle happens only once,” the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/peninsula-ban-do-film-review"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a> wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, “Peninsula” shows people trying to escape the zombie-ridden South Korea of the first film. Captain Jung-Seok is unable to get his entire family out safely and, four years later, goes back to the country from the safe harbor of Hong Kong, to attempt to recover $20 million from a food truck. The captain dodges flesh-hungry zombies in their quest to find the money. Peninsula grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8850222/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$39.7 million</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="miracle-in-cell-no">Miracle in Cell No. 7&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Turkey<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Drama<br><strong>Release date: </strong>10/10/2019</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2wPoBy2JQI?feature=oembed" title="Miracle in Cell No. 7 (Trailer- English subtitles) 2019 #MiracleInCell #Netflix #MiracleInCellNo7" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This Turkish drama, directed by Mehmet Ada Öztekin, is a remake of the 2013 South Korean film of the same name. The story focuses on Memo, a disabled father, and his seven-year-old daughter, Ova. At the film’s <a href="https://www.goldenglobes.com/articles/miracle-cell-no7-turkey">outset</a>, Memo and Ova live with her grandmother, Fatma Ana, in a small Aegean town.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Memo, who works as a shepherd, is sentenced to death after being accused of murdering the garrison commander’s young daughter. He is sent to cell number 7, where he awaits his execution. The prisoners realize that Memo could not have committed the crime. Back home, Fatma Ana passes away. Ova, now alone, sets out on a quest to be reunited with her father.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Miracle in Cell No. 7” was chosen as Turkey’s Oscar nominee for the 93rd Academy Awards and was the <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/arts/cinema/what-makes-turkish-miracle-in-cell-no-7-a-popular-hit">most-watched</a> film in the country in 2019. By the end of the film, viewers are forced to reckon internally with their own perceptions of good and evil — and to take a long look at abuses of power and flaws within the justice system. The film grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt10431500/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$17.2 million</a> at the box office worldwide.</p>



<h2 id="ip-man-4-the">Ip Man 4: The Finale</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> Hong Kong<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>12/19/2019</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3LzxNct3eA?feature=oembed" title="IP MAN 4: THE FINALE  Trailer (2019) Donnie Yen Action Movie" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The final film in the saga of Bruce Lee’s martial arts master, “Ip Man 4” turns the lens on racism in the United States. In the film, which grossed <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2076298/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">$176 million</a> worldwide, fight scenes are used as a way to turn foreigners’ biases against them.</p>



<p>Mostly set in 1964 San Francisco, the film pits karate against kung fu — in the forms of a racist marine and Ip Man, a master of the Wing Chun school of the Chinese martial art, played again by Donnie Yen.</p>



<p>Yuen Woo-Ping, whose resume includes work on “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and “The Matrix” films, stages fights that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/movies/ip-man-4-the-finale-review.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> deemed “thrilling” and full of “fluttering limbs in action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its imagery is “bathed in a mid-century wash that makes the film look like it came from an ad in <em>Life</em> magazine,” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ip-man-4-finale-1264391"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> wrote. The film’s signature scene involves a teacup, a revolving circular glass table, and two people who won’t back down.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="parasitenbsp">Parasite&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>From:</strong> South Korea<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Thriller<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 5/30/2019</p>

<p>The most pirated film last year shouldn’t be a surprise: as the first foreign-language film to win the Academy Award for best picture, it’s none other than “Parasite.”&nbsp;</p></div></div>

<p>A collection of “unpopular opinion” and get-rich-quick party spoiler “stop the music” articles on “Is Bitcoin a Ponzi? Is Bitcoin a Speculative Bubble? Is Bitcoin a Digital 21st Century Tulip Mania? Is Bitcoin Comedy Gold?”</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Prize Economists at various times, including Robert Shiller on 1 March 2014, Joseph Stiglitz on 29 November 2017, and Richard Thaler on 21 December 2017. On 29 January 2018, a noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as “a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology”, on 2 February 2018, professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the “mother of all bubbles”, and on 27 April 2018, a University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.</p>

<p>On 4 December 2013, Alan Greenspan referred to it as a “bubble” as did George Soros on 25 January 2018. Warren Buffett called bitcoin a “mirage” on 13 March 2014.</p>

<p>Do surgeries work? Most of us assume they do, but is there any scientific evidence that they do?</p>

<p>In this episode, I talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/drianharris">Dr Ian Harris</a> who is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Australia. He is a practicing orthopedic surgeon specializing in trauma surgery. Outside his practice, his research interests broadly cover the topic of surgical effectiveness and clinical research.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Notes and key insights</h3>

<p>1/ <strong>What is a placebo surgery?</strong> It’s where you make an incision but not do anything. </p>

<p>It’s analogous to traditional placebo in medicine, where a sugar or salt pill is given instead of an active chemical to see whether the intended medicine has an actual impact.</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Majority of surgeries that Dr Ian Harris and other researchers have studied in fact are not more effective than placebos</strong>. This is shocking because even when we have no proof that they work, many of these surgeries are happening even today.</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Examples of such ineffective surgeries include back pain surgeries and knee pain surgeries.</strong> For such surgeries, randomized control trials have found that if you make an incision in the knee but don’t do anything, it’s as effective as actually conducting the surgery of the knee.</p>

<p>4/ Why do patients get better if the surgery doesn’t work? It’s because<strong> many diseases or pain have a natural progression</strong>, and we generally seek surgical/medicinal intervention when we’re in the worst condition. If the body heals / condition becomes better after that, we attribute improvement to the intervention rather than thinking it could have happened anyway (due to the natural course of the condition).</p>

<p>5/ As Dr Ian Harris said, the unsaid attitude could be stated like: “<strong>you have to operate on patients quickly before they get better</strong>“.</p>

<p>Remember: in many cases, if you get sick, you get better after that. And that is why placebos seem to work.</p>

<p>6/ It’s shocking to hear that randomized controlled trials (RCT) for many surgical interventions end up finding that they’re ineffective.</p>

<p>But what’s most shocking is that <strong>many other interventions have never been subjected to an RCT against a placebo</strong>. For many of the common procedures traditionally practiced, we don’t know whether they work at all or not.</p>

<p>7/ For sure, there are many studies that study variations of surgical methods. That is, they try to find out whether an incision from the left is better or from the right. </p>

<p>But very few studies try to find out whether the incision does anything at all for the patient. Shocking, but that’s the truth.</p>

<p>8/ In that sense, <strong>surgery is different than medicine</strong>. All new pharmaceutical molecules are subjected to rigorous clinical trials where they’re tested against placebo or doing nothing. In many countries, there’s no such procedure for surgical treatments. If there is a procedure for new surgical procedures, nobody is testing old ones that have been getting performed every day without evidence.</p>

<p>8/ If research indicates many of the currently practiced surgeries don’t work, why are they still practiced?</p>

<p>Well, <strong>if your salary depends on not believing something, you won’t believe it.</strong></p>

<p>9/ And such <strong>denial is not new</strong>. The most common surgical procedure in history was bloodletting. This practice which lasted for thousands of years was only questioned in mid 19th century, and even after randomized trials showed that it hurt the patient, it wasn’t abandoned suddenly. It died a slow death as its practitioners started dying. </p>

<p>10/ Even today, the fact that practices like Homeopathy survive suggests that <strong>seeking evidence of what works isn’t a big priority for society</strong>. Perhaps keeping traditions is a bigger priority.</p>

<p>11/ But because it’s costly and risky to perform surgeries, the urgent question is: <strong>what surgical procedures are today’s equivalent of bloodletting</strong>? And those that we know are bloodletting, how do we get rid of them as a society?</p>

<p>12/ As a patient, what should you do? Dr Ian Harris recommends that every time your doctor recommends a medical procedure, <strong>ALWAYS ask for risks and benefits</strong>. </p>

<p>Risks are a given and doctors generally are happy to talk about them. But nobody asks for benefits because they’re assumed to be there. </p>

<p>Ask and confirm about benefits explicitly.</p>

<p>13/ What if the pain isn’t going away at all? Should you then get surgery?</p>

<p>Golden advice by Dr Ian -&gt;  “<strong>the severity of your symptoms does not change the effectiveness of the operation</strong>“</p>

January 21, 2021 | https://grund.me/posts/securing-custom-protocols-with-noise/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://grund.me/posts/securing-custom-protocols-with-noise/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>In the world of backend services, it’s of utmost importance to provide secure
communication channels. Traditionally, in services like those provided by
Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, the outside-accessible interface is provided via an
HTTPS endpoint and hopefully, the TLS connection is configured to only allow
secure cipher suites and provide the proper certificates.</p>
<p>In my time doing security reviews with teams across different parts of AWS
services, I’ve seen that it’s easy for teams to follow standard guidelines on
how to secure the customer surface, but it becomes harder to have the right
security and confidentiality properties in loosely coupled internal services. Of
course, guidelines exist as well and teams follow them very well. But behind the
APIs is where the business logic is implemented and the services need to scale.
Here is where the ingenuity of the engineers is required to come up with scalable
architectures and efficient solutions. In many cases, this will require some kind
of communication between service components. Not in all cases TLS is the
solution to everything.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The last time I was dealing with such a scenario, we had the following setup.
Multiple parties were communicating through a routing proxy. The
proxy was providing basic infrastructure routing capability and very limited
protocol inspection. The endpoints were loosely coupled and needed end-to-end
security and integrity.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://grund.me/proxy_with_routing.png"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Simple Proxy Connection</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There were multiple alternatives for end-to-end encryption like nesting TLS
connections through the proxy, using symmetric or asymmetric keys to protect the
payloads for example. None of these approaches felt elegant and scalable.</p>
<p>In this context, I started looking at how TLS works under the hood and how it
provides the necessary security properties. Here, I learned about Diffie-Hellman
key-exchanges and how this is embedded into TLS. Using the low-level OppenSSL
functions I was able to quickly draw up a protocol that builds upon DH key
exchanges using ephemeral and static public keys and I was happy.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach however was that it was quite some ugly code using
OpenSSL, there was no guarantee this was working exactly like this across
programming languages and there was some desire to not have to “roll our own
crypto”. The idea was abandoned at this point and replaced with something
readily available, but a less fitting approach to the problem.</p>
<p>A couple of months down the road I came across
<a href="https://noiseprotocol.org/">Noise</a>, a protocol framework for building secure
protocols based on DH key exchanges, designed to make it very hard to mess up
the communication challenge.</p>
<h2 id="the-noise-protocol-framework">The Noise Protocol Framework</h2>
<p>Initially, I thought, well this might be interesting but did not look too much
into it. But browsing through the specification, I liked the simplicity
of the approach and continued reading. Essentially, Noise is built upon
handshake patterns that are used to establish the secure communication challenge.
Different elements of the patterns can be combined according to the scenario.
Then it struck me when looking at the following handshake pattern:</p>
<pre><code>KK:
     -&gt; s
     &lt;- s
     ...
     -&gt; e, es, ss
     &lt;- e, ee, se
</code></pre><p>In <code>Noise</code>-speak, this means that two parties (Alice to Bob) communicate and
implement the protocol with the following agreed-upon handshake. The <code>KK</code>
pattern representing a scenario where the two parties have previously exchanged
their public keys. To initiate the communication, Alice executes a series of
steps, basically a series of DH and key-derivation steps, that is mirrored by
Bob. Bob then returns a message with keys derived similarly.</p>
<p>The cool thing is, that this particular pattern was very similar to
the protocol that I came up with in my project, but much more thought-through
and secure because of additional encryption with authenticated data.</p>
<p>And I even found a confirmation why this approach would have been very
beneficial in our case:</p>
<ol>
<li>0-RTT Encryption (0 roundtrip encryption) - communication can directly start
with the first message since all components a known ahead of time. In this
case the public key.</li>
<li>Sender authentication is resistant to key-compromise impersonation (KCI).</li>
<li>Encryption to a known recipient, strong forward secrecy.</li>
</ol>
<p>But this doesn’t explain how and why it works. In the next section, I’m
going to try to explain for the above case how the keys are generated and try to
shed some light on how the message protocol ends up working.</p>
<h2 id="noise-basics">Noise Basics</h2>
<p>Noise applies a set of very well-known and researched principles to make it work
in a very elegant way to avoid confusion and mistakes. The most important parts
that need to be understood are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman Key
Exchange</a>,
in particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">Elliptic curve
Diffie-Hellman</a>.
The very very short summary is that ECDH allows deriving a shared symmetric
key based on two asymmetric key-pairs.</li>
<li>Hashing using well-known and understood hashing algorithms like SHA-256.</li>
<li>Key derivation using a hash-based function using HMAC based on the same hash
function used in the hashing steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a rudimentary understanding of what happens using the above building blocks,
we can now take a deeper look into the message handshake protocol. As mentioned
before, the handshake protocol is an exact specification of how to build
an internal state so that both parties end up with the same symmetric encryption
keys.</p>
<p>However, instead of just using Diffie-Hellman on long-lived key-pairs, Noise
allows several combinations of static and ephemeral key pairs to achieve the
desired security properties.</p>
<h3 id="kk-handhake---e-es-ss-pattern">KK Handhake - e, es, ss pattern.</h3>
<p>In the diagram below, I walk you through the first important sequence of the
“KK” handshake pattern. As a quick recap, the “KK” message pattern relies on the
fact that the two parties have already exchanged their public keys, but want to
establish a secure communication channel with forward secrecy.</p>
<p>The key element of the KK pattern is that both parties know each other’s public
keys. The exchange of the necessary public keys has happened before in a
controlled environment. For example, imagine a fleet of backend hosts and with
each host, you generate a particular key pair. In a cloud environment, you can use
a key management service to provide these keys and make sure they’re properly
bound to only authorized hosts.</p>
<p>A quick legend for the image below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The blue left side is Alice, this actor uses one static key pair for
authentication and an ephemeral key pair for connection establishment. The
ephemeral key pair should be generated for every new session.</li>
<li>The green right side is Bob, this actor has a similar static key pair and an
ephemeral key pair for connections.</li>
<li>Green arrows indicate the exchange of public keys from Alice to Bob (solid green
arrow) or from Bob to Alice (dotted green arrow).</li>
<li>Red arrows indicate when the private keys are accessed by either party.</li>
<li>The dotted line in the middle symbolizes the network interface between the two.</li>
</ul>

            <h4>Graphical Explanation of what happens during the handshake.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, let’s walk through the process at least for the first part of the
handshake, extending it more would make the diagram particularly messy, but you
will get the gist of the chaining process that happens that makes it easy to
understand. The Noise specification mentions three state contexts: handshake
state, symmetric state, cipher state.</p>
<ul>
<li>The handshake state contains and builds the public and private keys needed to
process the messages.</li>
<li>The symmetric state contains a hash value <code>h</code> and a chaining key <code>ck</code> that are
continuously updated to build the internal state.</li>
<li>The cipher state contains a symmetric encryption key <code>k</code> and a nonce <code>n</code> that
is incremented every time the encryption key <code>k</code> is used. <code>k</code> can be used to
encrypt certain payloads part of the handshake messages and is particularly
useful for  zero roundtrip encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first part of the handshake is to process the pre-messages. Certain
handshake patterns do not have pre-messages, others do. In the case of the
“KK” pattern, the pre-message contains the previously exchanged public keys of
the two parties.</p>
<ol>
<li>To initialize the state, first, the protocol name (the full <a href="https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html#protocol-names-and-modifiers">protocol
name</a>
contains the pattern, the hash function, and encryption method) is hashed.
This then initializes the <code>h</code> and <code>ck</code> variables that are most important for
tracking the cryptographic state. In this initial step (1), <code>h</code> and <code>ck</code> have
the same value.</li>
<li>In this step, the static public key of Alice is hashed and <code>h</code> updated
appropriately.</li>
<li>Now, the static public key of Bob is hashed and <code>h</code> is updated. This
concludes the pre-message handling.</li>
</ol>
<p>After processing the pre-message, it is now time to process all the handshake
symbols of the first part of the handshake. Namely, <code>e, es, ss</code>:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Processing <code>e</code> means hashing the public ephemeral key of Alice and updating
<code>h</code>. Also, it will append the ephemeral public key of Alice to the
message buffer that is sent to Bob. This marks the exchange of the public
key.</li>
<li>Processing <code>es</code>: This is the first time, we perform a Diffie-Hellman
operation to derive a key. We use the ephemeral private key of Alice and the
static public key of Bob to derive a new temporary key.</li>
<li>Using the chaining key <code>ck</code> and a key derivation function based on HMAC to
derive a new chaining key and an encryption key. HMAC based on the selected
hash function is applied multiple rounds to create these two new secret
values. At the end of this step, <code>ck</code> is updated with a new value and <code>k</code> the
secret encryption key is set to the second temporary key, and the nonce <code>n</code> is
reset to <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>The final step is to process <code>ss</code>. This will perform a similar operation as
in the previous step but using a different set of keys. It will use the
static private key of Alice and the static public key of Bob. First, it uses
Diffie-Hellman to generate a temporary symmetric key.</li>
<li>This is the final step of processing the <code>ss</code> pattern. It uses the temporary
output value of the previous step as the input for the key derivation …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>Recently I discovered a nice way to capture call stack in Haskell exceptions almost transparently, and I’m going to share it in this post</p>
<p>If this is a known technique, let me know, otherwise — enjoy using it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-call-stack">What is a call stack</h2>
<p>Suppose somewhere in the program you use <code>error</code> to signal an impossible situation:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>foo ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-2">foo [] <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible!"</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">foo a<span>:</span>_ <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>bar ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">bar a b <span>=</span> foo a <span>+</span> foo b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then accidentally use it with an empty list:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> impossible<span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">  <span>error</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>4</span><span>:</span><span>10</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Obviously, there is an error, but <code>GHCI</code> also prints a peculiar thing: a call stack! It contains only one entry and isn’t helpful, though… So you go to <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/">GHC manual</a> to see what <code>HasCallStack</code> the message is talking about, and there it is: <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#hascallstack"><code>HasCallStack</code> section</a>.</p>
<p>As the manual says, you add <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint to your <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> functions:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>foo ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb3-2">foo [] <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible!"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">foo a<span>:</span>_ <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb3-4"></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><span>bar ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">bar a b <span>=</span> foo a <span>+</span> foo b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now the output becomes much more informative:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> impossible<span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">  <span>error</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span><span>10</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">  foo, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>10</span><span>:</span><span>11</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">  bar, called at <span>&lt;</span>interactive<span>&gt;:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span>1</span> <span>in</span> interactive<span>:</span><span>Ghci1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You get function names, module names and even source locations for all calls starting from the <code>ghci</code> prompt down to the point where <code>error</code> is called.</p>
<p>Remember, however, that stack is captured only as far from the <code>error</code> call as there are <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint. E.g., dropping the constraint from <code>foo</code> will also exclude <code>bar</code> from the log:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> impossible<span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4">  <span>error</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span><span>10</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Still, you get to know the precise location of the <code>error</code> call, which is nice.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>read</code> and so on use <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/GHC-Err.html#v:errorWithoutStackTrace"><code>errorWithoutStackTrace</code></a> (for performance reasons), so you won’t ever see stack traces from them. One more reason to avoid <code>head</code>!</p>
<h2 id="using-exceptions">Using exceptions</h2>
<p>However, using <code>error</code> to report errors is not very convenient: you can pass only a <code>String</code> as an argument and so catching specific errors while propagating others becomes very hard and messy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is another mechanism in GHC for that: exceptions. So you define your custom exception type and throw it from the <code>foo</code> function like this:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>data</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>=</span> <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">  <span>deriving</span> (<span>Show</span>, <span>Exception</span>)</span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>foo ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb6-5">foo [] <span>=</span> throw <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6">foo a<span>:</span>_ <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb6-7"></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><span>bar ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9">bar a b <span>=</span> foo a <span>+</span> foo b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You run it and expect to see the nice exception with a stack trace. But…</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>FooException</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You get none! What is going on, and how <code>error</code> is different from <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Control-Exception.html#v:throw"><code>throw</code></a>?</p>
<p>The reason is that exceptions don’t capture the stack trace automatically, even when thrown from a place with <code>HasCallStack</code> context. There is an <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/12096">open issue</a> to do so, reported back in 2016, but no progress was made yet.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-stacks">Capturing stacks</h2>
<p>But what if we want to capture stack with exceptions? One possible way would be to save the stack (represented as <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/GHC-Stack.html#t:CallStack"><code>CallStack</code></a> type) as part of the exception constructor, then make your custom <code>throwWithStack :: HasCallStack =&gt; Foo -&gt; IO ()</code> function and use it everywhere, but that is too cumbersome, and you may just forget to use the right throwing function.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a better way. Recall that magic <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint captures call stack from the point where something annotated with it is used. We don’t want to annotate <code>throw</code>, but there is one more thing on the same line — exception constructor itself! It turns out, you can use GADTs to capture stack with an exception data:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>data</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2">  <span>FooException</span><span> ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>FooException</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then access it in <code>Show</code> instance:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Show</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">  <span>show</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>=</span> <span>"FooException\n"</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> prettyCallStack callStack</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>deriving</span> anyclass <span>instance</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span>-- alternatively, derive Show from stock and print call stack in 'displayException' method.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here <code>callStack</code> is provided by <code>GHC.Stack</code> and will use <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint introduced by pattern match on <code>FooException</code> GADT constructor.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of how it works:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4">  <span>FooException</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>18</span><span>:</span><span>16</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5">  foo, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>22</span><span>:</span><span>11</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb10-6">  bar, called at <span>&lt;</span>interactive<span>&gt;:</span><span>7</span><span>:</span><span>1</span> <span>in</span> interactive<span>:</span><span>Ghci1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For another example, here is a real call stack I reproduced in our production code:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>Operation</span> timeout</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">  <span>TimeOut</span>, called at src<span>/</span><span>Database</span><span>/</span><span>Bolt</span><span>/</span>Connection.hs<span>:</span><span>38</span><span>:</span><span>36</span> <span>in</span> hasbolt<span>-</span><span>0.1</span><span>.</span><span>4.3</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>Database.Bolt.Connection</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4">  run, called at src<span>/</span><span>XXX</span><span>/</span><span>DB</span><span>/</span>Impl.hs<span>:</span><span>42</span><span>:</span><span>43</span> <span>in</span> xxx<span>-</span><span>0.3</span><span>.</span><span>5.0</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>XXX.DB.Impl</span></span>
<span id="cb11-5">  runDB, called at src<span>/</span><span>XXX</span><span>/</span><span>DB</span><span>/</span>Impl.hs<span>:</span><span>124</span><span>:</span><span>14</span> <span>in</span> xxx<span>-</span><span>0.3</span><span>.</span><span>5.0</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>XXX.DB.Impl</span></span>
<span id="cb11-6">  programs, called at src<span>/</span><span>XXX</span><span>/</span><span>API</span><span>/</span>Program.hs<span>:</span><span>33</span><span>:</span><span>17</span> <span>in</span> xxx<span>-</span><span>0.3</span><span>.</span><span>5.0</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>XXX.API.Program</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p><code>HasCallStack</code> is a magic constraint, so the fact that this trick works may or may not be a coincidence: some later change in GHC may stop GADT pattern match from affecting how <code>HasCallStack</code> is solved. However, I think that this approach is useful enough and may be used in practice. Just don’t forget to add enough <code>HasCallStack</code> to places which can fail.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, though, that <code>HasCallStack</code> is not free and sometimes can break some optimizations, especially if used in recursive functions (that’s the reason <code>head</code> &amp; friends do not capture the stack).</p>
<p>Of course, this post does nothing to help debugging standard exceptions, like <code>IOError</code>. For that, the usual way is to build with <code>-prof</code> and run your code with <code>+RTS -xc</code>, as documented in <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runtime_control.html#rts-flag--xc">the manual</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Let’s say my goal this year is to get to 10k monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>

<p>MRR first, everything else second. I would ruthlessly cut out all activities that don’t lead to a measurable MRR increase. For example, I would stop writing blog posts like the one you’re currently reading. I certainly wouldn’t create fun projects like What to Tweet or take the time for non-transactional Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I would focus on my revenue generating projects, crank up the advertising machinery and do everything I can think of that potentially increases my MRR.
I’m fairly confident that I would reach 10k MRR by the end of the year. But at what price?</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back for a second.</p>

<p>You know who manages by metrics? Big companies like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>And what do they have in common?</p>

<p>Their core product got notably worse over time.</p>

<p>Google’s search results are dominated by ads and many users now use workarounds to find what they’re looking for (“Best headphone reddit”). LinkedIn looks like Minesweeper. Facebook was a fun place to meet friends. And if you search for an electronics product on Amazon, you immediately feel like you’re at a flea market in the middle of Shenzhen.
This is the result of hundreds of decisions that were motivated by a short-term focus on specific metrics like revenue and click rates. And while these decisions most likely optimized the metrics, they made the user experience worse.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t have the technology to measure the right thing. Or maybe the “right thing” is inherently immeasurable.</p>

<p>Or, and that’s my personal favorite, we’re dealing with a Schrödinger’s cat like situation. The “right thing” is only the right thing as long as we’re not trying to optimize it.
This is known as Goodhart’s law. “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.“</p>

<p>Let’s consider another example.</p>

<p>Who else manages by metrics? Politicians!</p>

<p>Instead of some boring historic example (there are plenty, just read “Seeing like a State”), I’m going to spice things up by talking about something that’s happening right now.
It’s not hard to anticipate what I want to talk about since there’s precisely one thing that’s currently happening: Covid-19.</p>

<p>Politicians try to manage the situation by focusing on metrics like the “R number”. At least here in Germany the motto is: let’s lower the R number at all costs.
Turns out the cost of this strategy is incredibly high. It’s just not immediately measurable.</p>

<p>For example, everyone’s getting fatter since all gyms and sport clubs are closed. Most people are developing unhealthy eating habits because there’s simply nothing else to do. Social connections are rapidly degregating even though everyone knows how important they’re for the human wellbeing.</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor and don’t play one on the internet, but I can easily imagine that there are lots of further unintended consequences of the current lockdown policy. For example, since most people now spend most of their time indoors alone and wear masks when they leave their homes, their immune system isn’t stressed regularly like it usual is. Hence I wouldn’t be surprised if many people will get sick of other diseases once the lockdown ends as a result of weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I’m all for taking Covid seriously. In fact, I’ve been hoarding masks since 2009. I spent the summer of 2009 with a bunch of friends in Lloret de Mar (a party hotspot in Spain) just when news of the swine flu started to emerge. Long story short, everyone in our group got sick (20+ people) except for my girlfriend and me because we’ve been wearing masks.
Now the most famous example how focusing on metrics can have unhealthy consequences is the cobra effect. I’ll just quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term cobra effect originated in an anecdote that describes an occurrence during India under British rule. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one more example I always have to talk about when the topic comes up: academia.</p>

<p>Stagnation apologists love to argue that the lack of progress in science is simply a result of the fact that all low-hanging fruit are gone.</p>

<p>That’s complete nonsense. There’s still plenty of low-hanging fruit. It’s just that everyone is so busy chasing meaningless metrics that they can’t see them.</p>

<p>In academia the metric of choice usually has something to do with the number of citations. But just like Google’s backlink-driven algorithm (which was in fact inspired by academia’s citation metrics) was quickly gamed by savvy webmasters, academia’s algorithm is gamed by careerists.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about some tiny minority here. If you want to survive in academia, you have to play the citation game. And if everyone is cheating, at the very least you have to do the same to stand a chance.</p>

<p>You have to partner up with others because five people can write five times as many papers. You agree to constantly cite each other. Likewise, you focus on incremental additions to established ideas because that’s the safest way to new publications regularly. You work on the stuff everyone else is working on because how else are you going to get citations?</p>

<p>And one thing you absolutely have to avoid like the plague is the risky and deep kind of research that leads to real progress in the field.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that citations are a bad metric, and we need to come up with smarter ones. Instead, it’s just Goodhart’s law in action.
Every attempt to manage academia makes it worse.</p>

<p>As soon a new metric is introduced it will misdirect the attention of scientists towards playing the game, instead of progressing science.</p>

<p>I talked about three areas, but the same pattern occurs almost everywhere. For example, just remember when everyone started minimizing fat in their diet or how grades are used to measure “learning”.</p>

<p>Crucially the problem is not the specific metric that’s being used. Whatever new metric gets introduced will soon again be made useless by Goodhart’s law. The metrics game will always be akin to Whac-A-Mole.</p>

<p>Now where does this leave us? If management by metrics doesn’t work, what else should we do?</p>

<p>First of all, I think that looking at metrics can be helpful. They just shouldn’t be the sole yardstick decisions are measured against.</p>

<p>And while the map never will be the territory, the picture you’re looking at gets more accurate the more metrics you consider. For example, if politicians would not just consider the R number but hundreds of metrics that take different aspects of a population’s wellbeing into account, the decisions would be better ones.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that decisions become much harder if you consider more than one metric.</p>

<p>But more importantly there are so many factors we can’t measure that nevertheless should be taken into account.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I become convinced that it all boils down to talking to people.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about surveys that distill thousands of standardized “conversations” into a few numbers or analytics tools that do similar things for behavior. I’m talking about real one-on-one interactions.</p>

<p>Just imagine if Jeff Bezos would talk to hundreds of real (non pre-vetted) Amazon customers each month and take what he hears in these conversations seriously. Or if politicians would have long conversations with regular people from all wakes of life. Or if academic committees would actually talk to applicants before filtering them out based on citation metrics.</p>

<p>In our hyper rational world it’s extremely hard to justify decisions based on the mere gut feeling you got from a few conversations. But this is exactly what people should be doing.</p>

<p>Engagement metrics will never tell you if users are genuinely happy when they use your product. But a few genuine conversations will.</p>

<p>A resume will never tell you if a person is genuinely interested in uncovering unknown truths about nature. But a 30-minute conversation will.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s so much easier to reach a consensus if you just hire the candidate with the highest citation metrics or implement the feature that will lead to the largest revenue increase in the next quarter. But while it’s the easiest decision it’s usually not the best one.</p>

<p>And I think the same applies not just to managing organizations but also to managing ourselves.</p>

<p>Just by listening to my own body I’ll always know better than any fitness tracker if I slept well, better than any blood test if my diet is healthy, and better than my bank account if I’m happy.
That doesn’t mean that I’ll not use a fitness tracker, make regular blood tests, or check my bank account. But I certainly won’t allow them to dictate my decisions.</p>

<p>I’ll look at all the facts and take everything in, even the stuff that can’t be measured, and then I’ll just go with my gut.</p>

Some people speeding past you are <em>"obviously"</em> just moments away from a major data breach, while the others you're passing are <em>"clearly"</em> so worried about the entire data-center burning down, they couldn't possibly get anything else done. Everyone thinks everyone else has lost their marbles.</p><p>So with that in mind, here are a few steps I took to secure my newly minted server. Please feel free to use only the <em>"best practices"</em> you deem appropriate for your mission.</p><p>Or just <a href="#gitolite">skip to the "installing Gitolite"</a> part directly.</p><div id="admin-user"><h3>Admin User</h3><p>For whatever reason, be it for security or protecting the server from my stupidity, one of the first things I do when creating a new server is add a new user for my general admin tasks.</p><p>Adding a new user is remarkably easy to do on a Ubuntu system:</p><p>You'll be prompted to answer a few questions, including creating a new UNIX password. This will be the password you'll need to <code>sudo -i</code> and gain <code>root</code> permissions, so make it a good one, or use tools like <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">Pass</a>, or <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> to help you remember.</p><p>Then give our new <code>limb</code> user <code>sudo</code> permissions:</p><p>I've also largely eliminated all password based authentication when signing into servers, relying on open source smart cards like <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/">NitroKey</a> for authentication. If interested, this requires we setup <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> for our <code>limb</code> user:</p><p>Just replace <code>key</code> with your public ssh key:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ mkdir /home/limb/.ssh
$ echo "key" &gt; /home/limb/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre></div><p>Next, set the <code>.ssh</code> directory's file permissions so the <code>ssh</code> daemon can read the files:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ chown -R limb:limb /home/limb/.ssh
$ chmod 700 /home/limb/.ssh
$ chmod 644 /home/limb/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre></div><p>If everything worked, after you restart the <code>ssh</code> daemon (<code>service sshd restart</code>) you will now be able to login as the administrator user:</p></div><div id="openssh"><h3>OpenSSH</h3><p>Git and Gitolite (<a href="#gitolite">installed in the next sections</a>) will need us to keep port 22 open, allowing us to <code>git push</code> from anywhere on the internet. This open port will eventually attract <em>"a lot"</em> of attention from bots who endlessly scour the internet looking for vulnerable servers, mindlessly stuffing passwords, hoping one password will eventually let them in.</p><p>We can eliminate all worry about weak or compromised passwords by disabling all password based authentication, relying solely on <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/">asymmetric cryptography</a>, or <em>"ssh keys"</em>. Just use your favorite text editor to open <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and ensure these lines exist somewhere in it:</p><div><pre><span></span>PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
</pre></div><p>While we're here, a large majority <a href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> of these bots are interested in logging in as the <code>root</code> user. If you created a new admin account in <a href="#admin-user">the previous section</a> and ensured you can login using your public key, you can also disable <code>root</code> logins entirely with this line in the config:</p><table id="id2"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><a href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>Some simple <em>"bash-fu"</em> on my <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> shows ~93.58% of the roughly 15,000 login attempts since I started this server, tried to login as <code>root</code> Second place was the user <code>git</code> (including legitimate logins) at ~1.82%.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you uploaded your public key to your VPS provider, most of these changes should have already been configured for you. But in the off chance you had to make some changes, restart the <code>ssh</code> service to load the new config changes in:</p></div><div id="uncomplicated-firewall"><h3>Uncomplicated FireWall</h3><p>Depending on your VPS provider, they may also have a firewall system built into their admin panel allowing you to apply rules simply by adding tags to a server. However, I enjoy keeping all my firewall rules inside each box, if only for the same reason I <em>keep all my socks on the left hand drawer,</em> so everything stays organized and in the same place.</p><p>You can install <code>ufw</code> using the Advanced Packaging Tool:</p><p>Right now, the only thing we have enabled is <code>ssh</code> which uses port 22. To allow port 22 through <code>ufw</code> just use the following command:</p><p>and then turn the firewall on:</p><p>and <strong>viola!</strong> You have a firewall.</p></div><div id="fail2ban"><h3>fail2ban</h3><p>Even though we've turned off password based authentication <a href="#openssh">in a previous section</a>, we will still receive a significant amount of bots wasting our compute cycles trying to login. And while the likelihood of this being successful is <em>zero</em> when rounded to any order of magnitude, the bots will nevertheless continue to pilfer a non-zero amount of CPU if given the opportunity.</p><p>To stop the most brazen of these bots, tools like <a href="https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban">Fail2Ban</a>, which creates temporary firewall rules to block IP address who repeatedly fail to authenticate with <code>ssh</code>, are a great compromise between usefulness and annoyance.</p><p>The Advanced Packaging Tool can again help us install <code>fail2ban</code>.</p><p>Once installed, the <code>ssh</code> "jail" will come pre-enabled for you. If you wish to make any changes, you will need to make a copy of the <code>fail2ban</code> config file:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
</pre></div><p>Then add your changes to <code>jail.local</code> so they will persist after an upgrade.</p><p><code>fail2ban</code> does a great job documenting what each option does in the config file. Some of the changes I made are:</p><ul><li>because I use <code>ufw</code> to manage my firewall, I changed <code>banaction = ufw</code>.</li><li>enabled <code>bantime.increment</code> to increase the duration of a ban based on how many times the IP address has been banned previously.</li><li>enabled <code>bantime.rndtime</code> to <em>"randomize"</em> the length of a ban, preventing bots from knowing exactly when they can resume their assault.</li><li>enabled <code>bantime.maxtime</code> so I won't need to unban IP addresses (if you're unfortunate enough to share an IP with a bot).</li><li>lowered <code>bantime</code>, <code>findtime</code> and <code>maxretry</code> allowing me to issue small bans that increase in severity as the IP address continues to antagonize.</li></ul><p>Once you're satisfied with your changes, start <code>fail2ban</code> using <code>systemd</code>.</p><div><pre><span></span>$ systemctl enable fail2ban
$ systemctl start fail2ban
</pre></div><p>And <strong>Done!</strong></p><p>Depending on how <em>"popular"</em> you are on the internet, you should start to see <code>NOTICE</code> lines in <code>/var/log/fail2ban.log</code> of misbehaving bots and the equivalent firewall rules in <code>ufw</code>.</p><div><pre><span></span>$ cat /var/log/fail2ban.log | grep 'NOTICE' | tail -1

Once installed, Gitolite will give us more fine-grained-control over who has <code>git push|fetch</code> permissions to each repository. I encourage you to checkout <a href="https://gitolite.com/gitolite/basic-admin.html">Gitolite's amazing documentation</a> if only to see how capable Gitolite can be.</p><div id="step-1-create-the-git-user"><h3>Step: 1 - Create The Git User</h3><p>Before we install Gitolite, we'll need to create a new user for everyone to log into and to run Gitolite's Perl scripts. I typically use the username <code>git</code> for this, feel free to replace <code>git</code> with the username that you feel is more appropriate.</p><div><pre><span></span>$ adduser --system --group --disabled-password --home /var/lib/git git
</pre></div><p>This creates a new system-user on the server called <code>git</code>. Because this is not a <em>"normal"</em> user, there will be no aging information in <code>/etc/shadow</code>, which is convenient when nobody will be monitoring this account.</p><p>We also used the <code>--home</code> option to set the <code>$HOME</code> variable to <code>/var/lib/git</code>. This is where we will eventually put Gitolite's configuration files and our Git repositories. Feel free to adjust this to where you prefer, I've seen many use <code>/home/git</code>.</p><p>I included the <code>--disabled-password</code> to disable any password based access into our new user. In <a href="#openssh">the previous sections</a>, we've disabled all password based authentication into the server and Gitolite requires ssh keys for authentication, so disabling passwords for our user is a smart move.</p></div><div id="step-2-install-gitolite"><h3>Step: 2 - Install Gitolite</h3><p>Because Gitolite is just a bunch of Perl scripts, I prefer to install Gitolite from <a href="https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite">the source</a>. As we will see, installing Gitolite from source also has the benefit of making upgrades and adding custom patches in the future extremely easy.</p><p>This also means we'll need to install Gitolite's dependencies ourselves:</p><p>When we (or a colleague) signs into the server, using the <code>git</code> user, we will automatically run Gitolite's Perl scripts, which means these scripts must be executable by our <code>git</code> user. So, to make managing file permissions easier, we'll use our <code>git</code> user for the rest of the installation process.</p><p>Log into our <code>git</code> user with the "substitute user" command: (assuming you're the <code>root</code> user)</p><p>Then clone Gitolite's source code into the <code>$HOME</code> directory: (this should be <code>/var/lib/git</code> unless <a href="#step-1-create-the-git-user">you changed it</a> when we setup the <code>git</code> user above)</p><div><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Let me state up front that, while we’re going to be talking about an open source project that was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833206">recently submitted</a> to Hacker News’s “Show HN” section, the intent of this post is not at all to shame the developer who tried their damnedest to do the right thing. They’re the victim, not the culprit.</p>



<h2>RSA, Ya Don’t Say</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, an HN user shared <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet">their open source fork of a Facebook’s messenger client</a>, with added encryption. Their motivation was, as stated in the readme:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>It is known that <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-reads-messenger-messages/">Facebook scans your messages</a>. If you need to keep using Facebook messenger but care about privacy, Zuccnet might help.</p><p>It’s pretty simple: you and your friend have Zuccnet installed. Your friend gives you their Zuccnet public key. Then, when you send a message to your friend on Zuccnet, your message is encrypted on your machine before it is sent across Facebook to your friend. Then, your friend’s Zuccnet decrypts the message. Facebook never sees the content of your message.</p><p>I’m not a security person and there’s probably some stuff I’ve missed – any contributions are very welcome! This is <em>very</em> <strong>beta</strong>, don’t take it too seriously.</p></div><cite>From Zuccnet’s very humble README.</cite></blockquote>



<p>So far, so good. Facebook is abysmal for privacy, so trying to take matters into your own hands to encrypt data so Facebook can’t see what you’re talking about is, in spirit, a wonderful idea.</p>







<p>However, there is a problem with the <em>execution</em> of this idea. And this isn’t a problem unique to Zuccnet. Several times per year, I come across some well-meaning software project that makes the same mistake: Encrypting messages with RSA directly is bad.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet/blob/42e351e36b3b5dbaef06256ed11313fab77adb25/src/util/crypto.js#L57-L84">Zuccnet source code</a>:</p>


<pre title="">const encryptMessage = (message, recipientPublicKey) =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessage = crypto.publicEncrypt(
    {
      key: recipientPublicKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(message),
  );

  return encryptedMessage.toString("base64");
};

/**
 *
 * @param {String} encryptedMessage - base64 encoded string
 */
const decryptMessage = encryptedMessage =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessageBuffer = Buffer.from(encryptedMessage, "base64");
  const { privateKey } = getOrCreateZuccnetKeyPair();
  const message = crypto.privateDecrypt(
    {
      key: privateKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(encryptedMessageBuffer),
  );
};
</pre>


<p>To the Zuccnet author’s credit, they’re using OAEP padding, not PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This means their code isn’t vulnerable to Bleichenbacher’s 1998 padding oracle attack (n.b. most of the RSA code I encounter in the wild is vulnerable to this attack).</p>



<p>However, there are other problems with this code:</p>



<ol><li>If you try to encrypt a message longer than 256 bytes with a 2048-bit RSA public key, it will fail. (Bytes matter here, not characters, even for English speakers–because emoji.)</li><li>This design (encrypting with a static RSA public key per recipient) completely lacks forward secrecy. This is the same reason that <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP encryption sucks</a> (or, at least, one of the reasons PGP sucks).</li></ol>



<p>There are many ways to work around the first limitation.</p>



<p>Some cryptography libraries let you treat RSA as a block cipher in <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/">ECB mode</a> and encrypt each chunk independently. This is an incredibly stupid API deign choice: It’s slow (asymmetric cryptography operations are on the order of tens-to-hundreds-of-thousands times slower than symmetric cryptography) and you can drop/reorder/replay blocks, since ECB mode provides <em>no semantic security</em>.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="61" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/glitch-ecb/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png" data-orig-size="224,224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="glitch-ecb" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png 224w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px"><figcaption>I have strong opinions about cryptographic library design.<br>(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK">Swizz</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A <strong>much</strong> better strategy is to encrypt the data with a symmetric key, then encrypt <em>that key</em> with RSA. (See the <a href="#rsa-pkcs1">end of the post</a> for special treatment options that are especially helpful for RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.)</p>



<p>Working around the second problem usually requires an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE), similar to what I covered in my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/11/14/going-bark-a-furrys-guide-to-end-to-end-encryption/">Guide to End-to-End Encryption</a>. Working around this second problem <em>also</em> solves the first problem, so it’s usually better to just implement a forward-secret key exchange protocol than try to make RSA secure. </p>



<p>(You can get forward secrecy without an AKE, by regularly rotating keys, but AKEs make forward secrecy automatic and on-by-default without forcing humans to make a decision to rotate a credential– something most people don’t do unless they have to. AKEs trade user experience complexity for protocol complexity–and this trade-off is almost universally worth taking.)</p>



<p>Although AKEs are extremely useful, they’re a bit complex for most software developers to pick up without prior cryptography experience. (If they were easier, after all, there wouldn’t be so much software that encrypts messages directly with RSA in the first place.)</p>



<p>Note: RSA itself isn’t the reason that this lacks forward secrecy. The problem is how RSA is used.</p>



<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>



<h3>For Developers</h3>



<p>First, consider <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">not using RSA</a>. Hell, while you’re at it, <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">don’t write <em>any</em> cryptography code that you don’t have to</a>. </p>



<p>Libsodium (<a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages">which you should use</a>) does most of this for you, and can easily be turned into <a href="https://github.com/soatok/rawr-x3dh">an AKE comparable to the one Signal uses</a>. The less cryptography code you have to write, the less can go catastrophically wrong–especially in production systems.</p>



<p>If jettisoning RSA from your designs is a non-starter, you should at least consider taking the Dhole Moments Pledge for Software Developers:</p>



<blockquote><p>I will not encrypt messages directly with RSA, or any other asymmetric primitive.</p><cite>Simple enough, right?</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead, if you find yourself needing to encrypt a message with RSA, remind yourself that RSA is <em>for encrypting symmetric keys, not messages</em>. And then plan your protocol design accordingly.</p>



<p>Also, I’m pretty sure RSA isn’t random-key robust. Ask your favorite cryptographer if it matters for whatever you’re building.</p>



<p>(But seriously, you’re better off not using RSA at all.)</p>



<h3>For Cryptography Libraries</h3>



<p>Let’s ask ourselves, “Why are we forcing developers to know or even care about these details?”</p>



<p>Libsodium doesn’t encumber developers with unnecessary decisions like this. Why does the crypto module built into JavaScript? Why does the crypto module built into <em>most</em> programming languages that offer one, for that matter? (Go is a notable exception here, because their security team is awesome and forward-thinking.)</p>



<p>In my opinion, we should stop shipping cryptography interfaces that…</p>



<ul><li>Mix symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in the same API</li><li>Allow developers to encrypt directly with asymmetric primitives</li><li>Force developers to manage their own nonces/initialization vectors</li><li>Allow public/private keys to easily get confused (e.g. lack of type safety)</li></ul>



<p>For example: <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">Dhole Crypto</a> is close to my ideal for general-purpose encryption.</p>



<h3 id="rsa-pkcs1">Addendum: Securing RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5</h3>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Neil Madden informs me that what I wrote here is actually very similar to a standard construction called <a href="https://kel.bz/post/kem/">RSA-KEM</a>. You should use RSA-KEM instead of what I’ve sketched out, since that’s better studied by cryptographers.</p>



<p>(I’ve removed the original sketch below, to prevent accidental misuse.)</p>
