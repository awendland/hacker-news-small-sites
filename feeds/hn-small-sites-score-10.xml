                <p><strong>LONDON –</strong> Britain today became the first Western country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine for general use as it announced a rollout of Pfizer-BioNTech's drug from next week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for use," the Health Department said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week," the statement said. Priority groups will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and the clinically extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p>After months of "rigorous" clinical trials and thorough analysis of the data, the MHRA "concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness", the statement added.</p>

<p>"To aid the success of the vaccination programme, it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS (National Health Service) to do its work without being overwhelmed."</p>

<p>Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said it was a "historic moment in the fight against Covid-19".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK," he said.</p>

<p>Pfizer and BioNTech added that they expected further regulatory decisions from other countries "in the coming days and weeks".</p>

<p>The announcement came as England exited a month-long coronavirus lockdown, but most of the country remained under restrictions as a new regional system for cutting infection rates kicked in.</p>

<p>The four-week lockdown, which began last month, was imposed to stop surging rates of infection, ease pressure on health services, and to allow families to gather for Christmas.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Covid survivor, succeeded in winning a vote on the measures in parliament late yesterday, despite significant opposition within his own Conservative ranks.</p>

<p>"All we need to do now is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp and indeed being injected into our arms," he told lawmakers before the vote.</p>

<p>Until then "we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter", he warned. – AFP, December 2, 2020</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It's 2020. Quarantines are everywhere – and here I'm writing about one, too.
But this quarantine is of a different kind.</p>

<p>In this article I'll describe the <strong>Linux Kernel Heap Quarantine</strong> that I developed
for mitigating kernel use-after-free exploitation. I will also summarize
the discussion about the prototype of this security feature on the Linux Kernel
Mailing List (LKML).</p>



<p>Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel are very popular for
exploitation. There are many exploit examples, some of them include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/607">CVE-2016-8655</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/26/2">CVE-2017-6074</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">CVE-2017-2636</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-linux-kernel-af_packet-use-after-free/">CVE-2017-15649</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2020/02/15/CVE-2019-18683.html">CVE-2019-18683</a></li>
</ul>

<p>UAF exploits usually involve <strong>heap spraying</strong>.
Generally speaking, this technique aims to put attacker-controlled bytes at a defined memory
location on the heap. Heap spraying for exploiting UAF in the
Linux kernel relies on the fact that when <code>kmalloc()</code> is called, the slab
allocator returns the address of memory that was recently freed:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/no_quarantine.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/no_quarantine.png" width="60%"></a></center>


<p>So allocating a kernel object with the same size and attacker-controlled
contents allows overwriting the vulnerable freed object:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png" width="70%"></a></center>


<p>Note: Heap spraying for out-of-bounds exploitation is a separate technique.</p>



<p>In July 2020, I got an idea of how to break this heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation. In August I found some time to try it out. I extracted the slab
freelist quarantine from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html">KASAN</a> functionality and called it <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>.</p>

<p>If this feature is enabled, freed allocations are stored in the quarantine
queue, where they wait to be actually freed. So there should be no way for them
to be instantly reallocated and overwritten by UAF exploits.
In other words, with <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>, the kernel allocator behaves like so:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/with_quarantine.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/with_quarantine.png" width="60%"></a></center>


<p>On August 13, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/08/13/7">I sent</a> the first early PoC to LKML and started deeper research of
its security properties.</p>



<p>For researching the security properties of the kernel heap quarantine, I developed
two <code>lkdtm</code> tests (<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/7">code is available here</a>).</p>

<p>The first test is called <code>lkdtm_HEAP_SPRAY</code>. It allocates and frees an object
from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then allocates 400,000 similar objects.
In other words, this test attempts an original heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define SPRAY_LENGTH 400000

    <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>

        <span>spray_addrs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>
        <span>...</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>spray_addrs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"FAIL: attempt %lu: freed object is reallocated</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>)</span>
        <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is disabled, the freed object is instantly
reallocated and overwritten:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000002b5b3ad4 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: FAIL: attempt 0: freed object is reallocated
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is enabled, 400,000 new allocations don't overwrite
the freed object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000009909e777 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That happens because pushing an object through the quarantine requires <strong>both
allocating and freeing memory</strong>. Objects are released from the quarantine as
new memory is allocated, but only when the quarantine size is over the limit.
And the quarantine size grows when more memory is freed up.</p>

<p>That's why I created the second test, called <code>lkdtm_PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE</code>.
It allocates and frees an object from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then performs
<code>kmem_cache_alloc()+kmem_cache_free()</code> for that cache 400,000 times.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>

                    <span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>SPRAY_ITEM_SIZE</span><span>);</span>

    <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Push through quarantine: allocate and free %d objects of size %d...</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
                    <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>,</span> <span>SPRAY_ITEM_SIZE</span><span>);</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>push_addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>
        <span>...</span>
        <span>kmem_cache_free</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>push_addr</span><span>);</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>push_addr</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Target object is reallocated at attempt %lu</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Target object is NOT reallocated in %d attempts</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
                    <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This test effectively pushes the object through the heap quarantine and
reallocates it after it returns back to the allocator freelist:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000008fdb15c3 of size 333
   lkdtm: Push through quarantine: allocate and free 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 182994
  # echo PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000004e223cbe of size 333
   lkdtm: Push through quarantine: allocate and free 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 186830
  # echo PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000007663a058 of size 333
   lkdtm: Push through quarantine: allocate and free 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 182010
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the number of the allocations needed for overwriting
the vulnerable object is almost the same. That would be good for stable
UAF exploitation and should not be allowed.
That's why I developed <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6"><strong>quarantine randomization</strong></a>. This randomization
required very small hackish changes to the heap quarantine mechanism.</p>

<p>The heap quarantine stores objects in batches. On startup, all
quarantine batches are filled by objects. When the quarantine shrinks,
I randomly choose and free half of objects from a randomly chosen batch.
The randomized quarantine then releases the freed object at an unpredictable moment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 107884
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 265641
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 100030
   lkdtm: Target object is NOT reallocated in 400000 attempts
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 204731
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 359333
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 289349
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 119893
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 225202
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 87343
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this randomization alone would not stop the attacker:
the quarantine stores the attacker's data (the payload) in the sprayed objects!
This means the reallocated and overwritten vulnerable object contains the payload
until the next reallocation (very bad!).</p>

<p>This makes it important to <strong>erase heap objects before placing them in the heap quarantine</strong>.
Moreover, filling them with zeros gives a chance to detect UAF
accesses to non-zero data for as long as an object stays in the quarantine (nice!).
That functionality already exists in the kernel, it's called <code>init_on_free</code>.
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/5">I integrated it</a> with <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> as well.</p>

<p>During that work I found a bug: in <code>CONFIG_SLAB</code>, <code>init_on_free</code> happens too
late. Heap objects go to the KASAN quarantine while still "dirty." I provided the fix
in a <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/4">separate patch</a>.</p>

<p>For a deeper understanding of the heap quarantine's inner workings, I provided an <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/8">additional
patch</a>, which contains verbose debugging (not for merge).
It's very helpful, see the output example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 123, whole sz 65118872, batch sz 508854
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 494552, REDUCE head batch 0 by 415392, leave 396304
   quarantine: data level in batches:
     0 - 77%
     1 - 108%
     2 - 83%
     3 - 21%
   ...
     125 - 75%
     126 - 12%
     127 - 108%
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 79160, REDUCE head batch 12 by 14160, leave 17608
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 65000, REDUCE head batch 75 by 218328, leave 195232
   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 124, whole sz 64979984, batch sz 508854
   ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The heap quarantine <code>PUT</code> operation you see in this output happens during kernel memory freeing.
The heap quarantine <code>REDUCE</code> operation happens during kernel memory allocation, if the quarantine
size limit is exceeded. The kernel objects released from the heap quarantine return to the allocator
freelist – they are actually freed.
In this output, you can also see that on <code>REDUCE</code>, the quarantine releases some part of
a randomly chosen object batch (see the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6">randomization patch</a> for more details).</p>



<p>I made <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/10/01/7">brief performance tests</a> of the quarantine PoC on real hardware and in virtual machines:</p>

They are useful for learning a new language and developing simple programs, such as the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">“Hello World”</a> exercise. I often use online compilers when I am out, so that I don’t have to worry about locating and downloading all of the resources myself.</p><p>Since these online tools are essentially remote compilers with a web interface, I realized that I might be able to take remote control of the machines through command injection. My research identified a common weakness in many compilers: inadequate sanitization of user-submitted code prior to execution. My analysis revealed that this lack of input filtration enables exploits that an hacker can use to take control of the machine or deliberately cause it to crash.</p><p>A clever attacker can exploit built-in C functions and POSIX libraries to gain control over the computer hosting the online compiler. Commands like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/execl">execl()</a>, <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/system">system()</a>, and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/getenv">GetEnv()</a> can be used to probe the target machine operating system and run any command on its built-in shell.</p><p>I wanted to write this article to remind how sandboxed environment are important when shipping an application such as this!</p><h2 id="vulnerability-description">Vulnerability description</h2><p>In this section, I will introduce the reader to the vulnerability explaining both theory and practice processes.</p><h3 id="gaining-access">Gaining access</h3><p>In several of the C/C++ compilers that I analyzed, the GetEnv(), system(), functions allow an attacker to study and execute any command on the remote machine. The GetEnv() function allows a hacker to learn information about the machine that is otherwise concealed from the web interface, such as the username and OS version.</p><p>Once this information is revealed, the attacker can begin testing various exploits to achieve privilege escalation and gain access to a root shell. For example, the system() command can be used to execute malicious code and access sensitive data such as logs, website files, etc.</p><p>Since the exploit I discovered involves inserting hostile commands to gain control of an unwitting machine, this attack vector is classified as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection">code injection</a> vulnerability.</p><h3 id="maintaining-control">Maintaining control</h3><p>If hacker tries to run the online compiler every time they want to send a new command, the attack would leave an obvious trace, and the resource use might draw attention to the suspicious activity. These obstacles can be conveniently sidestepped by using the execl() function, which allows the user to specify any arbitrary program to replace the current process. An attacker can gain access to the machine’s built-in shell by invoking the execl() function to replace the current process with <code>/bin/sh</code>, with catastrophic implications.</p><p>Many compilers allow input from the browser, in which case the hacker can craft a program to relay input commands to the shell of the compromised machine. Once the hacker uses <code>execl()</code> to open a shell via browser, they can simply operate the remote machine using <code>system()</code> to inject various instructions. This avoids the need to run the compiler each time the attacker wishes to explore or exploit the compromised machine.</p><h3 id="implications">Implications</h3><p>A hacker that obtains shell access in this way gains access to files and services typically protected from outside users. The attacker now has many options at their disposal for exploiting the machine and/or wreaking havoc; how they proceed will depend on their tools and motives.</p><p>If the attacker wishes to crash the target machine, they can achieve this by (mis)using the fork() function, which creates <a href="https://serhack.me/articles/introduction-to-monerov-and-its-inherent-risks/"><del>a new cryptocurrency</del></a> clone of the current process. A fork() function placed within a while (true) loop will execute indefinitely, repeatedly cloning the process to greedily consumed precious RAM memory. This rapid uncontrolled use of resources will overwhelm the machine, causing a self-DOS (denial of service attack).</p><p>Instead of maliciously crashing a machine, an attacker may wish to monetize their illicit access. This can be accomplished by injecting a cryptocurrency miner, which will generate funds for the attacker at the expense of the victim’s computational resources and electric bill. My analysis showed that this maneuver allows useful exploitation of online compilers that successfully stymied other attacks by sandboxing the environment or adopting more advanced techniques to limit file access.</p><h3 id="theory">Theory</h3><p>This section documents the commands used to gain and maintain access to the online compiler. These functions require the unistd.h and stdlib.h libraries.</p><h4 id="execl">execl()</h4><h5 id="declaration">Declaration</h5><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>execl</span>(<span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span>pathname, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span>arg, ...);</code></pre></div><p>Parameters:</p><ul><li><p><strong>pathname</strong> - char*, the name of the program</p></li><li><p><strong>arg</strong> - char*, arguments passed to the program, specified by _pathname_</p></li></ul><h6 id="description">Description</h6><p>The execl() function replaces the current process with a new process.

Access to protected files and services can be prevented by creating a secure sandbox for the application. This minimizes the potential for collateral damage and inappropriate data access, but will not prevent some attacks such as cryptocurrency miner injection. In order to avoid these “mining” attacks, the sandbox should have limited resources and it should be able to reboot itself every 10 minutes.</p><p>To eliminate the underlying weakness, the libraries could be recompiled without the particular exploitable functions. An attacker cannot gain a foothold if the execl() and system() are removed or disabled by recompiling libraries.</p><p>In addition to this, tools such as <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a> might be used to create a sandboxed environment. A sandbox is a mechanism to run applications in a limited space. It usually provides a restricted and controlled set of resources to the program that needs to be tested, such as a restricted area of memory or a set of limited system calls; normally, network access, the ability to inspect the host system or read from input devices, are disabled or highly restricted.</p><p>At the time of my search, I found at least two compilers with a non-sandboxed environment. I contacted the managers and they resolved in less than a week. For others I verified that they were actually under a sandboxed environment. Injected scripts were immediately identified and the “malicious” user was banned.</p><p>Do you have any suggestions for my articles?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Integrating security as a part of application development is desirable, but it's often forgotten or dismissed in practice. Dependabot is a Github feature that will help you keep all your dependencies invulnerable and up-to-date, and you can enable it in just a few clicks!</p>
</section><article><section><p>I've often been told that integrating security as a role and shared responsibility in application development is important. Yet, in my experience, security is frequently given a low priority by developers. Progress is primarily estimated by looking at an application's new features, and security measures are considered invasive and complicating to our day-to-day-work. Luckily, there are tools that requires little effort to increase our focus on security, such as Github's Dependabot  </p>
<h2>What is Dependabot?</h2>
<p>Simply put, Dependabot is a tool designated to keep dependencies secure and up-to-date. How it works can be summarized in the following three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dependabot scans your dependency files for outdated or insecure dependencies.</li>
<li>Dependabot creates pull requests for dependencies that need an update.</li>
<li>You review, test and merge Dependabot’s changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following Github's acquisition of Dependabot in May 2019, the feature was added natively to Github. With only a few clicks, Dependabot can easily be enabled from the Github dashboard, and help you keep your application’s dependencies up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Enough background information, let us talk about how to get started. Github's security settings can be configured for an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization">entire organization</a>, applying to all of the organization’s repositories, or it can be configured <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository">per repository</a>. Which is the better option depends on your context. If you are the owner of your organization and it is desirable to enable the security features across all of its repositories, obviously it would be less time consuming to configure this on the organization level, rather than for each repository individually. However, if you are a part of a large organization with lots of teams and projects, enabling Dependabot on the repository level might be the only option.</p>
<p>In this example, we will enable Dependabot on a single repository. In your repository, there should be a button titled “Security”. Note that the security option is only visible to administrators, hence it will not be visible if you don't have the admin role in the repository. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kScW0pN/screenshot-2020-11-21-at-18-06-01-1.png" alt="To enable Dependabot, click on the &quot;Security&quot; button."></p>
<p>In the security overview, there is a row titled “Dependabot alerts”. If not already activated, there should be a button to “Enable Dependabot alerts”. Click it. You should now have three options that you can enable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency graph</li>
<li>Dependabot alerts</li>
<li>Dependabot security updates</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependency graph</h3>
<p>The dependency graph is a summary of the manifest and lock files stored in a repository. Enabling this feature is a prerequisite for the other options, as Dependabot requires access to the dependency graph in order to create alerts and updates.</p>
<h3>Dependabot alerts</h3>
<p>The alerts allows Dependabot to notify you when it finds a weakness. This is probably the key feature that you are here for. When activated, the number of unresolved alerts is highlighted in the "Security" button that we previously clicked. On the security tab, the alerts highlighting currently outdated dependencies are listed. By clicking on an alert, you will find more details on it, such as a description of the vulnerability and in what version of the dependency it was patched.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VMrM5Kh/screenshot-2020-11-16-at-19-59-16.png" alt="Security: Dependabot alerts" title="Unresolved Dependabot alerts are listed in the repository."></p>
<h3>Dependabot security updates</h3>
<p>By enabling the third option, the security updates, whenever a vulnerable dependency is discovered, Dependabot will try to fix it. If it is possible to upgrade the vulnerable dependency without disrupting the dependency graph of the repository, Dependabot will generate a pull request bringing the dependency up-to-date. The pull request is given a compatibility score indicating whether the update could cause breaking changes. The number is based on the percentage of tests in public repositories that passed when performing the same update.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2vr3GBb/dependabot-pull-request.png" alt="Example pull request generated by Dependabot" title="A pull request generated by Dependabot"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, in my experience working with Dependabot, more often than not, it is unable to generate pull requests. This is often because the source of the vulnerability is an indirect or transitive dependency. The Dependabot documentation states that <em>“(...) security updates are triggered only for dependencies that are specified in a manifest or lock file. Dependabot is unable to update an indirect or transitive dependency that is not explicitly defined.”.</em> This means that even though Dependabot is able to perform some automatic updates, you should expect to perform most of the updates yourself - for now.</p>
<p>Even though Dependabot is unable to perform automated dependency updates most of the time, I would recommend enabling the feature. Occasionally it <em>will</em> be able to create the pull request for you, and you'll have saved yourself a couple of minutes that you can spend on something else.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xXLhGLr/dependabot-pr-error.png" alt="Error message: Dependabot cannot update to the required version" title="More often than not, Dependabot is unable to generate a pull request"></p>
<p>If you already have established an effective process to update your project's dependencies, Dependabot might not be able to help you. Otherwise, you should definitely give it a try. It's free, it takes minimal effort to set up and - no matter how you use it - it's a better option than not monitoring your dependencies in any way.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p>Reggie Fowler, the former NFL minority owner linked to missing Tether and Bitfinex funds, owes his defense team more than $600,000, according to a new<a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/106df130-d8cc-418e-bbc0-8e46715e7b0a.pdf"> court filing</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fowler’s lawyers <a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/12/reginald-fowlers-lawyers-want-to-quit-did-he-neglect-to-pay-them/">want to drop out of the case</a> due to nonpayment, but they need to get permission from the court first.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/24/reggie-fowler-hoodwinks-his-own-defense-team/">Last we left off</a>, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter ordered attorneys at law firm Hogan Lovells—also representing defense lawyer Scott Rosenblum at Rosenblum Schwartz &amp; Fry—to file three versions of a sealed letter dated Nov. 18.</p>



<p>The public version—redacting what should not be revealed to the government or the public—discloses more details on the lawyers’ frustrations with a client who perpetually strings them along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hogan Lovells attorneys James McGovern and Michael Hefter initially asked for a $25,000 retainer in late 2018 when they first met with their client. Fowler only ever paid the retainer, and two years later, he now owes them $600,000.</p>



<p>His defense team believed all the stories he told them that he was swimming in money, so they weren’t too concerned—at first.</p>



<p>“From the very inception of this matter, we have been led to believe that Mr. Fowler is a high net worth individual with substantial assets, which would allow him to pay his legal bills with little hardship,” the lawyers said in their letter to the judge. </p>



<p>Hogan Lovells started working with Fowler on October 18, 2018. They had their first meeting with him on Nov. 8, 2018, around the time Fowler was initially contacted by the FBI. </p>



<p>“When we agreed to represent Mr. Fowler, it was our understanding that he had been targeted by cryptocurrency businessmen seeking to take advantage of Mr. Fowler’s personal balance sheet as a means of transacting cryptocurrency transactions without drawing the attention of bank compliance officers or regulators,” they said. </p>



<p>Fowler was later arrested in Chandler, Arizona, on<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services"> </a>April 30, 2019. (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services">DoJ press release and indictment</a>.)</p>



<p>After his release in May <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/11/reginald-fowler-man-at-center-of-cryptocurrency-scheme-out-on-5-million-bail/">on $5 million bail</a>, Fowler hired Scott Rosenblum to join the defense team. Rosenblum asked for a $275,000 retainer and an additional $85,000 per week retainer, if the case went to trial.&nbsp;Rosenblum received a partial retainer of $100,000, which Hogan Lovells notes that Fowler paid “while he had several unpaid, overdue invoices for legal services issued by Hogan Lovells.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Fowler paid another lawyer (unnamed) in Portugal in full for her services. He also paid international law firm Reed Smith LLP for&nbsp;services rendered in 2018.</p>



<p>“The fact that other attorneys had received payments from Mr. Fowler for their services led us reasonably to believe that Mr. Fowler’s representations to us that he would pay our bills was truthful,” the lawyers said.</p>



<p>In the second half of 2019, the lawyers were diligent about contacting Fowler for money. Each time they reached out, he told them payment was imminent and that “transactions or business deals that would fund the payment of our fees were in process”—but he never paid him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February, following a plea bargain that went awry and a superseding indictment, the defense team realized the case would likely go to trial, requiring a substantial amount of work, and still no check from their client. </p>



<p>Fowler has ample funds, they said, including “$10 million in real estate that is unencumbered and could have been liquidated or monetized at any point during the past two years.” His refusal to pay, the lawyers added, has “led to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.”</p>



<p>The government has till Dec. 8 to respond and replies are due Dec. 11.</p>

And Front was, at first, popular mostly with support teams and other teams that deal with a high volume of customer inquiries. But over time, Front has grown from being a product for a specific kind of workflow to being a tool that people use across organizations.</p><p>The fact is that most companies are still stuck in time from twenty years ago when it comes to managing how they triage, assign, and respond to all those emails. That's a big pain point, because as it turns out, a lot of the critical work that companies do takes place over email. </p><p>What Front has realized is that owning the orchestration and collaboration around email puts them in a position to “back into” $66B worth of vertical markets—CRM, project management, knowledge management, conversational marketing, and others.</p><p>To show the size of that opportunity and demonstrate the progress that Front has made towards its goal in this report, we aggregated all the public data out there on Front, then extrapolating and interpolating to fill in the gaps using backchannels to confirm our numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>We learned that Front, like Slack, has consumer-grade engagement, elite compounding revenue from their land and expand strategy, and increasingly broad adoption inside teams.</p><p>By focusing on external vs. internal communication, however, Front may also have a TAM that is several times as large as Slack's.</p><h2 id="front-s-roadmap-to--2b--4b--20b">Front's roadmap to $2B/$4B/$20B</h2><ul><li><strong>Our financial model values Front at $1.3B, with a price per share around $11.</strong> At their Series C in January, they were valued at $920M, or about $7.70~ per share.</li><li><strong>Front is currently trading on the secondary market between $7.25 and $9.00 per share.</strong> 5-year IRR for each scenario in our model ranges from 3% to 22% in the bear case, 22% to 46% in the base case, and 84% to 118% in the bull case.</li><li><strong>Front is like Slack for email</strong>. It is a multiplayer tool that lets teams better communicate—via chatting with other team members within the context of a personal or shared inbox—and coordinate—via tagging, rules, and 3rd-party integrations—how they respond to email.</li><li><strong>Front's 72% DAU/MAU ratio is on par with elite, consumer-grade apps</strong>. WhatsApp was at 70% pre-Facebook acquisition. Combined with its 148 minutes of average active daily usage (compare to Slack at 90 minutes) Front effectively has the engagement of a high-grade consumer app.</li><li><strong>Front's 137% net dollar retention demonstrates they are landing and expanding with an extremely efficient bottom-up model.</strong> Compare to 143% for Slack at IPO and 140% for Zoom at IPO.</li><li><strong>Zendesk and Intercom pose a threat because they have much deeper access to customer data. </strong>Intercom embeds itself in their customers' websites, giving them direct insight into the behavior of their customers, while Zendesk serves as a centralized hub for all things sales, support, and/or knowledge management for hundreds of thousands of companies.</li><li><strong>However, Front's high engagement platform makes them attractive to third-party developers. </strong>The more activity Front can promote on its platform, and the larger the variety of integrations their customers are using, the more adoption they'll have inside organizations and the wider their moat—based on the cost of switching away to another email product—will become.</li><li><strong>Expanding across organization opens up the opportunity to "back into" $66B worth of adjacent vertical markets </strong>. While today Front is focused on facilitating third-party integrations to tools like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce, building their own versions of these products would allow them to (at minimum, and per product) 2-3x their average revenue per user—today, Zendesk's Enterprise plan costs $199 a seat, while Front's most expensive plan is just $79 per seat.</li><li><strong>Building their own vertical solutions also puts Front on a converging course with Salesforce ($226B), Microsoft ($1.63T), and Google ($1.19T).</strong> Front's endgame is essentially to recreate the Google or Office 365 suite. But Microsoft was able to overtake Slack's active user count within just two years—a company that had similar ambitions. The threat Microsoft/Google pose and their ability to freely push copycat products to a user base of millions could make it extremely challenging for Front to move upmarket and reach enterprise scale.</li><li><strong>Front's product also makes them an attractive acquisition target. </strong>Rather than attempt to build their own team email product, Microsoft and/or Google could buy Front. That said, Salesforce is the company most likely to acquire Front—both because they don't have any email tool of their own yet and because there's no risk of cannibalization or customer confusion as there would be with a Microsoft/Google acquisition.</li><li><strong>Ultimately, Front’s consumer-grade engagement and ability to achieve org-wide adoption position them well to compete on their own in the cloud productivity space</strong>. Most deep workflow products serve specific functional units (Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce) while products that serve whole teams (Outlook, Gmail) have only superficial access to customer data. Front, on the other hand, is a workflow product and an org-wide tool all in one: a combination that could make them a formidable competitor even to the 800 lb. gorillas of B2B SaaS.

              <p>This is my own journey on getting a CS degree and why I think you should or shouldn't major in Computer Science.</p><p>If you google right now, what are the best majors to study in college, it's a guarantee that Computer Science (CS) will be on almost every list. There are so many statistics about how much <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2019/06/12/computer-science-graduates-earnings/">CS graduates make</a>. At some big companies the likes of FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), fresh CS graduates can easily command six figures salaries, including benefits and cool perks. The total compensation in these companies is hardly less than six figures ($100,000)!</p><p>Computer Science is considered one of the top majors as far as ROI (Return on Investment) is concerned. Just year one out of school and into the workforce a CS grad will be making higher compared to grads from other majors. Even when someone isn't lucky enough to land one of the positions in big tech companies (FAANG), still they can easily make 55k fresh from school. <em>It should also be noted that the writer of this article is based in the US, so the figures here might not be so representative of other regions in the world.</em></p><p>So looking at the job prospects and earning potential, you can see why there is such a flux of students wanting to do CS in college.</p><p>And here is the question, should you major in Computer Science? </p><p>This post is about my journey on deciding to major in CS and why I would advise someone to major or not to major in CS. </p><p>...</p><p>December 2014, I got the news that I will be going to a small college in the Midwest of the United States for my college education. I was 23 by the time and at that point in my life, I had made some big life mistakes already (like quitting high school to become a professional athlete). As you might have guessed that didn't end well. 2 years and a half taught me a lot about life, dreams, aspirations. and most importantly it taught me about family...that will be a blog post for some other time. But there I was reading the email that in about 8 months I would be in school again for my bachelor's. Before quitting high school, I used to say to myself... "if I go to college I would study Psychology and Philosophy"...because the two fields really dug my intellectual curiosity. But when people asked me what would I do with Psychology or Philosophy...I didn't know what to tell them...I only knew I wanted to learn more about the two fields. I wasn't interested in a professional career in any of the two fields...just wanted to study them. Did that ever happen to you?</p><p>So I didn't want to make the same mistakes I did during high school years...I intentionally made a choice of choosing a major field of study that will be lucrative and pretty much guarantee me success. There I was googling the best majors to study in college.</p><p>Here is a short snippet of that research:</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png" alt="Majors That Pay You Back" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Majors That Pay You Back</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png" alt="Major vs Salary Potential" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Major vs Salary Potential</figcaption></figure><p>Armored with that research plus a lot of other information I got from friends who were already studying CS and those who graduated with good jobs, I narrowed to Computer Science.</p><p>...</p><p>Fall 2015, my first year in college:</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2015 (Left) &amp; Spring 2016(Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>Sophomore year, Fall 2016</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2016 (Left) &amp; Spring 2017 (Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>By the end of Spring semester 2017, I had completed<strong> 22 credits of the 46 credits</strong> required by the CS program at my school.</p><p>In the fall of 2017, I didn't return back to campus...I had an opportunity to study abroad in London where for the whole semester I didn't take any Computer Science class.

But for easy of following through I just listed in the order of the first time I took them. In addition, I took one elective from another school which was <strong>CS 428</strong> <strong>Network Programming, </strong>and also I took <strong>EN 300C,</strong> an <strong>Advanced Writing</strong> class from another department in my school which substituted for my <strong>Technical Writing</strong> class in my CS major. And one more <strong>Math class</strong> was required to satisfy the requirements for the CS major.</p><p>So in a nutshell, that was my major. 4.5 or 5 years later, <strong>46 CS credits</strong> bagged and I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science.</p><p>The reason I listed all those classes above is to give you kinda a full picture of what a CS degree is about. When you just hear the words 'Computer Science', you might not really know what it's about...So the subjects above will at least shade some light. However, if you really wanna dive deep, I would suggest not just to look at the subjects offered in the program BUT make sure you read the syllabus too if you're able to get one. Syllabi will list topic by topic and week by week of exactly what the specific CS subjects will cover, there will be no surprises!</p><p>...</p><p>Now comes the meat of my blog post...Should you major in Computer Science?</p><p>Taking the money component out - we already know that a CS major can result in higher earning potential overall. What other reasons are there for you to major in see? Are you even interested in the field itself?</p><p>Most people when they hear about the Tech fields or Silicon Valley or working at Google or Microsoft, they mostly think about Computers and they might think about Computer Science as a way to get there, though they might not really know much about the Computer Science field itself.</p><p>I don't blame them, I was in the same situation...Initially I thought Computer Science will be learning about how to create these beautiful websites that I see on the Internet. Or maybe by studying Computer Science I will be able to make the next Facebook, Instagram and so forth. That was what initially clouded my mind.</p><p>Some of you might be surprised to know that a career in tech especially the one involving Computer Science or Programming for that matter...might not necessarily constitute you making products from scratch. There will be a lot of trying to understand, fix and maintain past code base. It might not be as alluring as some of the TV shows might make you believe. The technologies you work with might not be the ones of your interest. For example, I have never liked C# as a programming language or .NET frameworks as a web dev platform but there I was at my first job...using Windows, Visual Studio and .NET framework. You can imagine how excited I was.</p><p>...</p><p>As someone who has traveled this journey though not for so long, I can't emphasize enough on the importance of knowing exactly what you're getting yourself into. After all, college is a big investment both in terms of money and time, so pick both your majors and career carefully. One way of getting a good feel for what you're getting yourself into, either it's Computer Science or any other field is to make sure you get some internships while in college. Get an internship in something you're either majoring in or considering a career in. That will give you real-world experience of what your profession will look like once you graduate. It will give you time to think about the work culture, the work hours, the pressure, the work itself, etc. ...I had a friend in college who after doing an internship for about 4 months or so...he found out a career in Computer Science or programming wasn't for him. And he went ahead and changed his major from Computer Science to Economics, on the way he secured a minor in Computer Science.</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png" alt="Do you like your job?" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Do you like your job?</figcaption></figure><p>One of the things that will make you like your job is by first enjoying studying the field that you're in. Do you enjoy the field you're majoring in?</p><p>Look at the classes I listed above, do they interest you in any way? If they do then congrats! A CS program might be a good fit. But don't just end there like I said in the beginning...I would like you to go and check the syllabus for all those classes and see what you will study week in and week out. </p><p>Let me tell you something... as someone who was more interested in web development...I didn't enjoy most if not all of my CS classes. Had I used that time to learn more about web design and development...learning specific languages used for the job I would have benefited more and enjoyed my time in college. Here web development technologies like JavaScript, PHP and their frameworks together with WordPress, SASS, the JAM stack, etc.</p><p>So what am I trying to say here..? If the reason you decided to get into a CS program is because you love to design and develop websites...then you might be in the wrong place...a CS class in Computational modeling will be pretty much a bore to you. You would appreciate that time instead if you were learning first hand the tools and languages you will be working with in the real world.</p><p>Walk this process backward...ask yourself...who do you want to become...a web developer? a software engineer? a UI/UX engineer? a database administrator..? a network engineer? Then once you know whom you want to become...look for resources that will allow you to do that...these might involve a major in college, maybe a minor, books, online courses, tools used in the industry, etc.</p><p> If you pick a major, don't be blinded by a bracket name like a 'Computer Science'. Understand exactly what that entails...go and look at the syllabus of each course you will take in that major. Don't just assume a CS major will grant you those mobile or web development skills etc. The job market can be very specific...They might look for a Java developer, a PHP developer, a Python developer, an iOS developer etc. While knowledge of one language might help you easily pick up another one...it's a good thing if you can focus on what you're interested in early on. </p><p>...Being a mobile developer is different from being a web …</p></div></div>

Sometimes  that bias  is  greatly  to  our  advantage.  Sometimes  it  is  not.  The  printing  press  annihilated  the  oral  tradition; telegraphy  annihilated  space;  television  has  humiliated  the  word;  the  computer,  perhaps,  will  degrade community life.  And so on. <b>Fourth</b>, technological change  is not additive;  it is ecological,  which  means, it changes everything and is, therefore, too important to be left entirely in the hands of Bill Gates. And <b>fifth</b>, technology tends to become  mythic; that is, perceived as  part of the  natural  order of things, and therefore tends to control more of our lives than is good for us.&nbsp;</p><p>I will close  with this thought. <b>In the past,  we experienced technological change  in  the  manner  of  sleep-walkers</b>.  <b>Our  unspoken  slogan  has  been “technology  über  alles,” and  we have been willing to shape our lives to fit the requirements of technology, not the requirements of culture. This is a form of stupidity, especially in an age of vast technological change. We need to proceed with our eyes wide open so that we many use technology rather than be used by it."</b></p></blockquote><p><b>Presentation: <a href="https://prezi.com/p/egoxlf6-bln8/neil-postmans-five-ideas-to-technological-change/">Neil Postman's Five Ideas to Technological Change</a></b></p><p><b>"The Surrender of Culture to Technology" - talk by Neil Postman </b></p><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>I Love It! (I Hate It.)</h2><p>There's a sound of rustling paper. You crack the wrap at the seam. You look inside, unveiling the item within. It's...</p><p>Crap. It’s crap. It’s a crap present that you don’t want.</p><p>You lift your head and, with a beaming grin, you <em>somehow</em> manage to let out a torrent of thanks and praise for what you have just received. This is wonderful! It's just what I wanted! How did you know? I love it! I'll treasure it forever!</p><p>Within a day, it's stuffed in a drawer. Within a week, it's forgotten. Within a month, it's on eBay or off to the charity shop. Worse, it just ends up in a landfill somewhere.</p><p>If you had to guess, how many times would you say this has happened to you when you've received gifts at Christmas or on birthdays?</p><p>Here comes the even worse part: now think about how many times this might have happened with gifts<em> that you have given to others.</em></p><p><strong>Think you've got a perfect record?</strong> Think again, because you really, honestly, probably don't.</p><h2>A Lot of Gifts Aren't Actually That Good</h2><p>In 1993 - to cries of 'Grinch!' - economist Joel Waldfogel published a now-infamous paper (among certain economist circles, anyway) titled '<a href="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/WaldfogelDeadweightLossXmas.pdf">The Deadweight Loss of Christmas</a>'.</p><p>In it, Waldfogel argues that huge sums of money are wasted every year on gifts that nobody really wants. More accurately, he reported that many gift recipients valued their gifts at a dollar amount much lower than was actually paid for the item.</p><p>For example, if I bought you a gift for $100 and you thought that it was actually worth about $70 it would mean that, somewhere along the line, <em>you’ve destroyed $30</em>. Pop! It's gone. You might as well have just taken your cash and burnt it.</p><p>Waldfogel found that anywhere between 10% and 33% of all Christmas gifts cause this kind of loss every year. This is stunning, especially when we extrapolate out to the entire population.</p><p>He concludes by saying that many people could do worse than simply giving cash as a gift because it would carry more value than the actual gifts they might otherwise have bought.</p><p>Unless you are absolutely convinced that you are god's gift to... well, gift-giving, then you're probably seeing the same loss of value with your own gifts. Or, to put it another way, <strong>a lot of your gifts probably suck whether you realise it or not</strong>.</p><p>You won't see this, though, because nobody is going to turn around and tell you that your gifts were 'only 70% good'. If anything, the reactions that we get with a good gift and a bad gift are remarkably similar. Nobody wants to make you feel like a bastard at Christmas, even if you did hand out some absolute clangers.</p><p>But is it so bad, really, losing a few dollars every year? In short, yes. And then some. But not just because of the money you're wasting.</p><h2>Good Gift Giving Is Incredibly Important</h2><p>Outside of bland analysis by economists that ordinary people haven’t heard of, gift-giving helps us maintain and preserve social ties at all of life’s most important occasions; birthdays, Christmas, Valentine's day, anniversaries, graduations... you name it.</p><p>In between these occasions there is usually some kind of imbalance between the gifts that we have given to one another. That is, you might knock it out of the park one year and I might give you something that’s nowhere near as good. Next time, I'm going to want to do much better. This imbalance leads, in part, to the continuation of the tradition.</p><p>Giving good gifts help to form and strengthen social bonds. It helps us show people how much we care, how much we love them. It helps us say sorry. It helps us convey meaning. It helps us have fun and take delight in generosity. A life without giving and receiving gifts would be a dull life indeed.</p><p>On the other hand, giving bad gifts can degrade the quality of those same bonds. <strong>At best, it can be annoying to be given a bad gift. At worst, it can drive people apart.</strong> If Waldfogel's research is correct, an awful lot of us are unwittingly dropping the ball every year, without really realising it.</p><p>Luckily, it's not just economists giving their miserable analysis of the situation; a handful of psychologists have waded in and they're here to tell you that you're just <em>thinking</em> <em>about it all wrong</em>.</p><h2>Why Our Gifts Don't Work</h2><p>There's a surprising amount of research literature out there that all points in a similar direction as to why gifts don't work and what we can do about it. To find a way through this gift-giving minefield, I've gone through some of the most widely-cited papers to get to the bottom of it all. (Citations can be found at the end of this article.)</p><h3>Gift-Givers and Gift-Receivers Think Differently</h3><p>Gifts don't always hit the spot because the psychology of <em>giving</em> gifts is totally different to the psychology of <em>getting</em> gifts. Although it all happens during the same event, we unwittingly think about these two things in totally different ways.</p><p>When people <em>give</em> gifts, they typically want to nail one or more of these four different things:</p><ul role="list"><li>Surprise (the wow factor)</li><li>Desirability (the clout factor)</li><li>Materiality (the price tag)</li><li>Social responsibility (that is, looking virtuous)</li></ul><p>Gift <em>receivers</em>, though? <strong>Their priorities are completely different</strong>. They want:</p><ul role="list"><li>Usefulness (can I do something with it?)</li><li>Versatility (can I do a variety of things with it?)</li><li>Quality (is it well made/going to last?)</li><li>Stuff they've asked for (did I actually say I want this?)</li></ul><p>Given the difference between these two lists, is it any wonder that some gifts simply don't hit the mark?</p><h3>We Focus too Much on The Moment of Exchange</h3><p>When we give gifts we are mostly thinking about 'the moment' in which we hand it over, seeing the reaction of our recipients. We narcissistically want the chorus of 'oohs' and 'aahs' that come with nailing a really good gift that somebody loves. Whether or not those reactions last any longer than the moment of exchange, though, is not something that gift givers really care about.</p><p>Research shows that we make greater errors with gift giving when those gifts are being opened in public - perhaps at a party - than when we give them in private - such as wedding presents.</p><p>This is because<strong> we end up optimising for the maximum showboat potential of the gifts we give</strong> because it feels good to do so well in public. Once the event is over, though, we basically forget about it all. Onto the next thing.</p><p>Not so for the gift recipient. After the party is over and everyone's gone home... they've still got the gift. It matters much more to them what comes <em>after</em> the moment of exchange.</p><p>This means that it's better to buy a gift that has greater long term appeal than just the momentary 'wow' factor, even if it doesn't feel as good to us in the moment.</p><h3>We Like to Be Given Experiences... But We Don't Like to Gift Them</h3><p>Research shows that an 'experience' gift - like a night out at the theatre or a wine tasting course - is often preferred instead of the usual variety of material gifts that get doled out every year.&nbsp;</p><p>The only problem is that gift-givers don't really like to give experiences as gifts because the moment of exchange is relatively dull. This is usually because there's some stand-in that gets handed over - a voucher or a certificate - and the response is likely to be bland at best.</p><p>The <em>real</em> excitement comes much later when they cash that voucher in. But, of course, the gift-giver can’t actually be there to see that happen. No good.</p><h3>We Care too Much About the Price</h3><p>Gift-givers tend to believe that the more generous or pricey a gift is, the better it must be. This rarely works. For recipients, the absolute quality of the gift matters much more. This is equally true for something that the giver thinks is really thoughtful, too.</p><p>This happens when we put an enormous amount of thought and money into a gift for a friend or relative, <strong>only to find that they have no interest in it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A good example of this might be picking up on someone's love for music and then buying them a beautiful acoustic guitar. There's little guarantee that they have any interest in playing an instrument at all, no matter how expensive it is or how much thought you put into it.</p><p>If they're not regularly playing that thing a year later, you’ve probably goofed.</p><h3>We're Too Distant</h3><p>If you're genuinely quite distant from the gift recipient, it's almost impossible to get a good gift for them that they will genuinely want. This means one of two things:</p><ol role="list"><li>You probably shouldn't bother, or</li><li>You can give them cash (or a cash equivalent)</li></ol><p>Whether or not you <em>should</em> give them cash is another question. If they're your grandchildren this is absolutely fine. If they're your grandparents, perhaps not.</p><p>In the latter instance, a good 'consumable' like a decent bottle of wine or a box of chocolates will do. But don't worry about it much more than that.</p><h3>Be Careful With Charity Gifts</h3><p>Sadly, recipients are less grateful about virtuous charitable gifts than we would hope for. While they're good for the cause, they don't score well against the ways in which we normally value gifts. They make the gift giver look good and they feel good in the moment, but they are not valued as much. </p><p>Of course, if someone tells you that they would value a charitable gift then go for it. But don't assume that anybody will actually like it as a gift unless you have discussed it in advance.</p><h2>How to Buy Gifts People Actually Want</h2><p>All hope is not lost. You <em>shall</em> buy gifts that people will actually want! Here's how.</p><h3>Be Realistic About Your Relationship With The Recipient</h3><p>In Waldfogel's 1993 study, there's a chart of gift effectiveness that more or less screams at aunts, uncles and grandparents to simply not bother with material gifts and to give cash instead:</p><figure id="w-node-9f5a4418121f-c39ae183"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8b192239b9b4843e9ae18f/5fbfe9af234e056f30021f18_GTfsGCvFwKV3s1qidXi6Ls7EIYGoOQBVRr8o_3XvvwZ6IHt4QwNvAaje0p8Il8hWv-Yz1jcRU9A98nTmQMijJOrXU6E6gZC5FSi4_f_WOLuJY2XXZtR2CCIEYZsyAMvYo1P60Hr3.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you soulmates, together as a couple for many years? You obviously stand a much higher chance of getting the recipient something they will actually want.</p><p>If you’re anyone else, you will have a harder time and should maybe not worry so much about making sure your gift is as ‘thoughtful’ as possible and just focus on making their gift useful or buying them an experience.</p><h3>...Ask Them What They Want</h3><p>It seems obvious, …</p></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Years ago, we had a big decision to make. In 2013, STH had grown to a size that would seem immeasurably small by the traffic we do today. Still, at that point, we made the decision that it made fiscal sense to leave Amazon AWS for colocation. We chronicled the reasoning in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-sth-leaving-cloud-amazon-aws/">Falling From the Sky Why STH is Leaving the Cloud</a> and then the cost breakdown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-part-3-evaluating-amazon-ec2-vps-dedicated-colocation-options/">Falling From the Sky Part 3 – Evaluating Amazon EC2, VPS, Dedicated and Colocation Options</a>. Since 2013, we have been doing some irregular updates that largely correspond to planned upgrades of our infrastructure. Since we are taking a look at a few upgrades again, it is time to go through the exercise again.<span id="more-48850"></span></p>

<p>If you want to hear this instead of just reading, we have a YouTube video with some commentary here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Our Colocation Hosting versus AWS Costs Compared 2020 Edition" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqetN_i0BnE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we can go into a bit more detail below, but some prefer to listen rather than read so we have that option.</p>

<p>In 2018, we looked again at whether it was time to move back to the cloud. In our cost analysis, this is what we found using 1-year estimates:</p>
<figure id="attachment_26722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26722"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-part-4-leaving-the-cloud-5-years-later/sth-2018-web-hosting-budget-v-aws/" rel="attachment wp-att-26722"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg" alt="STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS" width="536" height="156" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg 536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-400x116.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-533x156.jpg 533w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-534x156.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26722">STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to give some sense of how that March 2018 estimate has gone in the 32 months since we looked at this, we ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Way more bandwidth. STH has grown a ton since 2018. We also focus more on reviews which tend to use more photos. Even with lazy loading images, our bandwidth usage is significantly higher. This did not incur an incremental cost based on how we buy bandwidth. See: <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/buyers-guide-hosting-bandwidth-data-transfer-billing/">Buyer’s Guide to Hosting: Bandwidth, Data Transfer and Billing</a></li>
<li>Several of our VMs doubled memory requirements and we added slightly more storage. We overprovisioned so this was absorbed with still enough leftover.</li>
<li>We replaced a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/9-step-calm-and-easy-proxmox-ve-boot-drive-failure-recovery/">SSD</a>, upgraded a firewall, and added another <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/explaining-the-automatic-transfer-switching-ats-pdu/">ATS PDU</a>. We have not done long-term infrastructure upgrades.</li>
<li>We ended up using an upgraded node that we had available, as a “hot spare”. We tend to “self-warranty” hardware, and so we had an extra system/ chassis there.</li>
<li>We are going to say we used four hours of labor. This includes drive time to the primary data center. Since it is far away (18-20 minute drive), we actually did not go there for several quarters. So over 32 months, we had budgeted $640 for remote hands. We effectively either paid $160/ hr or paid less than that even rounding up to four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it looks like we probably over-estimated self-hosting costs again, and underestimated AWS costs with respect to how much we would spend there, even after service discounts.</p>
<h2>The Late 2020 AWS v. Colocation Update</h2>
<p>We wanted to answer the question of what the picture would look like for hosting STH now. A few quick words before we get there on assumptions.</p>
<p>First off, we completely could change the way we run the site. That is a given. Frankly, running in VMs whether on the cloud or in self-hosting is convenient. Indeed, we run containers in VMs as well. We could also overhaul the entire software stack again, but frankly, we want to spend more time creating content then doing that work. Something that we learned was that we had less reliability by increasing complexity than by keeping things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Second, we are modeling current data transfer, and a minimal set of VMs. We actually have a lot more running, including some services that we run for some of the labs. One could argue that since they are lab services they are part of bringing you STH, but they are not focused on the web hosting aspect so we are going to remove them. Also, we have other VMs that are likely only online because we wanted to try something and had capacity. We may or may not elect to run the VMs if there was the AWS incremental cost. We could model these as on-demand or spot instances, but instead, we are just removing them entirely.</p>
<p>Third, we completely understand spot pricing. We are modeling a basic set instead of adding extras. At some point, we need databases, nginx servers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Fourth, we are going to add a mix of AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon instances roughly about what we use for our hosting. We are heavily weighting the larger instances toward the EPYC instances since that helps bring down the costs and for our workloads, there is no appreciable difference. We could go Arm, but that requires some small lift and shift work.</p>
<p>Finally, we do use some AWS services. Those services we would use regardless so we are excluding them from the analysis. We are also not modeling services such as Mailchimp which handles our weekly newsletter, Teespring that handles our online merch shop, YouTube which hosts our videos, and so forth.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved No Upfront</h3>
<p>Here is the calculator for the absolute base setup for our hosting using 1-year reserved upfront instances:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48851"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-reserved-no-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48851"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront" width="1114" height="222" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg 1114w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-400x80.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-800x159.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-696x139.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-1068x213.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48851">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, our hosting costs are just under $4,300 per month.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Swapping to 1-year reserved partial up-front on the instances helps bring pricing down a bit albeit with a $19,512 up-front cost.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48853"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-partial-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48853"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Partial Upfront" width="1112" height="242" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg 1112w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-400x87.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-800x174.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-696x151.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-1068x232.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48853">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Partial Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>When we factor in the up-front we get a $4,137.63 monthly cost along with a $49,651.56 total annual cost for the year. We are not discounting here using future values/ present values. There is a big issue with this. Typically, we tend to see our servers run for years. To model that, we tend to use 3-year reserved partial upfront.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 3-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Using the 3-year reserved partial upfront on the instances gives us a much lower operating cost with a larger up-front payment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48852"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-3-year-partial-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48852"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 3 Year Partial Upfront" width="1117" height="247" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg 1117w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-400x88.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-800x177.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-696x154.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-1068x236.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1117px) 100vw, 1117px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48852">2020 AWS Calculator 3 Year Partial Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>First off, the $39,020 is more than we have spent in the last three years on hosting hardware. We do not purchase machines with long warranties or high markups, so if you are buying the average Dell/ HPE/ Lenovo server and think that sounds like a single server, you are trading higher upfront costs for service contracts. Given what we have seen on hardware/ remote hands, it is not a model we are pursuing. On the operating side, we get down to $1,968.51 per month which is great.</p>
<h2>STH 2020 Hosting Budget</h2>
<p>Next year, we will likely do two small changes. First, we will upgrade database nodes and instead of using Optane SSDs, we will move to Cascade Lake and Optane PMem DIMMs into the database servers and upgrade a few older nodes to AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” systems. We are testing the Ampere Altra 80-core server right now, and we are at the point where we might consider using Arm in the hosting cluster this year. We are going to increase our hardware budget to $10,000 this year. Although we did not use most of our hardware budget in 2019 nor 2020, we expect to in 2021.</p>
<p>Making up our monthly cost, we increased a bit for inflation. We used a $895/ mo budget in 2018. Our costs are effectively flat, but we are going to assume a bit more labor to install servers/ upgrade the hardware.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48855"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-v-self-hosting/" rel="attachment wp-att-48855"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg" alt="2020 AWS V Self Hosting" width="685" height="197" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg 685w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting-400x115.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48855">2020 AWS V Self Hosting</figcaption></figure>
<p>We are budgeting $22,000 per year or around $1833.33 per month. This is about the same as we would need for EC2’s 3-year partial upfront reserved instance, albeit without the up-front costs.</p>
<p>The one item that skews this substantially, is that we are not replacing every node every year. We are now in a very different place than we were when we started this journey. We have existing infrastructure that is frankly fine from a performance and node count standpoint even though we have relatively under-invested over the past 32 months. We had budgeted around $1687/ month for the last two months and spent under $1000. Still, at some point, we like to replace equipment before it fails.</p>

<p>There is clearly a lot going into this. We now have just under 8 years since this 10U colocation spot in Las Vegas was our first setup:</p>

<p>What is not reflected in our discussion is all of the lessons learned along the way. Also, as hardware has gotten faster, and memory prices have decreased, the cost of self-hosting has gone down significantly for our applications. We are also taking advantage of falling bandwidth prices. While AWS is absolutely the right choice for many applications, and indeed we use them, for our web hosting it is not what we want for a simple and inexpensive setup. This may not be the perfect analysis, but it is a little bit of how we now look at hosting at STH.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Prometheus's query language <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/">PromQL</a> is one of the cornerstones of the Prometheus ecosystem. Back in our August blog post, <a href="https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/08/06/comparing-promql-correctness-across-vendors">Comparing PromQL Correctness Across Vendors</a>, we looked at several external projects and monitoring vendors that claimed to offer PromQL-compatible APIs. Using an <a href="https://github.com/promlabs/promql-compliance-tester">open-source compliance checker tool</a>, we evaluated each implementation by running a set of test queries against both the native Prometheus server and the vendor implementation. As a result, we found multiple bugs in the tested projects, and mapped out in detail how each deviated from the upstream implementation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more vendors have entered the PromQL space, while existing projects have worked on improving their PromQL support as a result of our last blog post. Today, we are presenting an updated set of PromQL test results both for existing projects and a couple of new ones. We tested each of these implementations against the latest Prometheus version, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.23.0">v2.23.0</a>.</p>
<h3 id="before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores"><a href="#before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores" aria-label="before we start a note on interpreting test scores permalink"></a>Before we start: a note on interpreting test scores</h3>
<p>When looking at individual test results, please note that the numeric scores alone paint a limited picture. They don't necessarily tell you how impactful implementation errors are, nor how many distinct behavioral differences there are. Since PromQL expressions naturally compose and build on top of each other, it is infeasible to isolate all possible query errors into fully independent test cases. Many of the test queries will contain the same constructs as other queries, in a nested way. For example: If an implementation selects data incorrectly, then this breaks not only a simple data selection test query, but also all other test query cases that try to run a function, operator, or other transformation based on selected data. The test cases also include a lot of variations of the same type of query, but with different ranges, quantile values, or other parameters. So if e.g. a function is broken in a general way, it may cause multiple test case variants to fail at the same time.</p>
<p>Another matter of more subtle interpretation are vendor extensions and extreme edge-case behavior. For example, a vendor may choose to not raise an error when executing a function with a parameter value that is illegal in native PromQL, but legal and sensical in the extended language. Or a vendor may return a different value for an unusual edge-case behavior, such as running <code>histogram_quantile()</code> with a quantile value larger than <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>We still provide the numeric test scores as a quick way to map out the vendor landscape and to motivate the ecosystem towards achieving a 100% score. But if you need to understand behavioral differences in more depth, please <a href="https://promlabs.com/promql-compliance-tests">take a look at the full test results</a> and read on for the details.</p>
<h3 id="criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests"><a href="#criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests" aria-label="criteria for including a vendor in tests permalink"></a>Criteria for including a vendor in tests</h3>
<p>We are always on the lookout for new PromQL implementations to include in these tests. To include a project or vendor, we look for two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone is either advertising full or partial PromQL compatibility of their system, and/or otherwise positioning their solution as a drop-in replacement for an existing PromQL implementation.</li>
<li>For practical purposes, we need to be able to ingest test data into the system and query it back via a PromQL-style HTTP API. Otherwise, we can't run any tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, some vendors failed the second criterium for now, so we couldn't include them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sysdig.com/">Sysdig</a> <a href="https://docs.sysdig.com/en/using-promql.html">advertises PromQL support</a>, but has no <code>remote_write</code> protocol support to ingest arbitrary test data. According to contacts at Sysdig, <code>remote_write</code> may be supported at some point in the future, but we couldn't get a recent update on its availability timeline.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vmware.com/de/company/acquisitions/wavefront.html">Wavefront</a> <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_prometheus.html">advertises partial PromQL support</a>, but they lack an HTTP endpoint against which to run test queries. Their PromQL support is only available within their own user interface so far, which makes it difficult to test against. However, judging by the various compatibility caveats listed in their documentation, we do not expect that they would reach a high test score if we could test them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to be able to test even more vendors in the future.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After publishing, we received questions about PromQL support in two more vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a> once <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/promql">started implementing PromQL support</a> (coincidentally with the help of the author of this blog post), but as far as we are aware, this effort has been paused and PromQL support in InfluxDB is neither currently available nor is it being advertised.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-metrics-7-7-0-released">advertised PromQL support in Elastic Metrics</a>. However, the announced feature is only about Elastic Metrics being able to run queries against an <em>existing</em> external PromQL endpoint (such as Prometheus) to then ingest the query result as metrics into Elasticsearch. There is no way to run PromQL on the resulting data stored in Elasticsearch itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set"><a href="#minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set" aria-label="minor updates to the test query set permalink"></a>Minor updates to the test query set</h3>
<p>Since the last testing round in August, we made minor changes to the test query set:</p>
<ul>
<li>For queries that looked at the absolute values of counter metrics (e.g. with no <code>rate()</code> or similar counter-related function applied), we changed the selected metrics to be gauges instead. This helps keep test cases somewhat more independent for a vendor like New Relic, which does not support storing or retrieving absolute values for counters.</li>
<li>We added a query selecting an intermittently present series to test whether <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#staleness">staleness handling</a> works.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lets-get-started-updated-comparisons"><a href="#lets-get-started-updated-comparisons" aria-label="lets get started updated comparisons permalink"></a>Let's get started: Updated comparisons</h3>
<p>In this round of tests, we tested the following projects and vendors, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chronosphere.io/">Chronosphere</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/">Cortex</a> - An open-source, horizontally scalable reimplementation of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/">Grafana Cloud</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://m3db.io/">M3</a> - An open-source metrics engine and time series database.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.metricfire.com/">MetricFire</a> - A hosted monitoing and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos</a> - An open-source project to provide query aggregation for long-term storage and HA on top of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timescale/promscale">Promscale</a> (<a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>) - An open-source project to store Prometheus data in TimescaleDB.</li>
<li><a href="https://victoriametrics.com/">VictoriaMetrics</a> - An open-source time-series database and monitoring system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at the test results for each of these systems:</p>
<h4 id="chronosphere"><a href="#chronosphere" aria-label="chronosphere permalink"></a>Chronosphere</h4>
<p>Chronosphere does not have a self-service account creation system yet, but they helpfully provided us with a test account with <code>remote_write</code> and PromQL HTTP API support. Chronosphere is built on top of M3 (tested below), so we expected similar test results for the two. After an initial test run against an outdated test environment using an older M3 version, Chronosphere updated our test account and we achieved a test score of <strong>100%</strong> against it.</p>
<h4 id="cortex"><a href="#cortex" aria-label="cortex permalink"></a>Cortex</h4>
<p>Last time we tested Cortex we encountered two minor issues: floating-point input timestamps were <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/2932">not rounded in the same way</a> as in Prometheus, and the system did not <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/416">support executing queries without a metric name</a>. The first issue has been resolved entirely, while the second one is being addressed by a new storage mode in Cortex - the new <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/">blocks storage mode</a> vs. the older <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/chunks-storage/">chunks storage mode</a>.</p>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/releases/tag/v1.5.0">version 1.5.0 of Cortex</a> and see what scores each of these modes received:</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-chunks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-chunks-storage" aria-label="cortex with chunks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with chunks storage</h6>
<p>When testing Cortex with the old chunks storage, we can now remove the query tweak to align input timestamps, since that bug has been fixed. Other than that, we still get the same test score of <strong>99.62%</strong> due to the chunks mode not supporting queries without metric names.</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-blocks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-blocks-storage" aria-label="cortex with blocks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with blocks storage</h6>
<p>Cortex with blocks storage mode now also does not require any query tweaks anymore and passes with a score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="grafana-cloud"><a href="#grafana-cloud" aria-label="grafana cloud permalink"></a>Grafana Cloud</h4>
<p>Grafana Cloud is a new test candidate that <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/metrics/prometheus/">advertises full hosted Prometheus functionality</a>. Under the hood, Grafana Cloud uses Cortex to offer this service. According to representatives from Grafana Labs, they are in the process of phasing out the last (shared) chunks-based Cortex cluster, while all new Cortex clusters are already using blocks as their storage mode.</p>
<p>To be able to cache PromQL queries, Grafana Cloud aligns incoming query start and end timestamps to the query resolution step width (10 seconds in our case). This is currently not configurable on the Grafana Cloud side, so we had to apply a cross-cutting query tweak to align input timestamps to our reference Prometheus server in the same way, to get comparable results.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we tested a Grafana Cloud account via <code>remote_write</code> and their Prometheus-style HTTP query API on both the remaining legacy cluster and a new dedicated blocks-storage cluster, and we got the same <strong>99.62%</strong> and <strong>100%</strong> test scores as for Cortex itself. Since the chunks-mode cluster is being retired this month, we count that as an overall <strong>100%</strong> score for Grafana Cloud.</p>
<h4 id="m3"><a href="#m3" aria-label="m3 permalink"></a>M3</h4>
<p>M3 is also a new candidate in this group that states, "M3 can be used as Prometheus Remote Storage and has 100% PromQL compatibility", <a href="https://m3db.io/">on its homepage</a>. Its documentation also mentions <a href="https://m3db.github.io/m3/integrations/prometheus/">Prometheus and PromQL integrations</a> that include <code>remote_write</code> support and a PromQL HTTP API endpoint. Using these with M3 version v1.0.0, we ran our test suite and received a test score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For PromQL to work 100% the same as in Prometheus, we had to ensure that our test query was only hitting raw, non-aggregated data in M3 (vs. data that has been downsampled into a lower resolution). We did this by not configuring any aggregation in our test M3 database.</p>
<h4 id="metricfire"><a href="#metricfire" aria-label="metricfire permalink"></a>MetricFire</h4>
<p>MetricFire, a hosted service by the people behind <a href="https://www.hostedgraphite.com/">hostedgraphite.com</a>, is still pretty new in the Prometheus space. While MetricFire documents how to write data into the system using the <code>remote_write</code> protocol, there is no officially supported way to run external PromQL queries against the collected data using an HTTP API yet. However, MetricFire representatives kindly explained a way to do this. We won't detail it here, but we expect that there will be a documented public HTTP API soon. In our talks with MetricFire we learned that they also use Cortex to back their service, and we also …</p></div></div>

<p>
No Starch Press is publishing a book based on this website in early 2021. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This book will <em>not</em> teach you how to use OpenGL or DirectX; instead, it can teach you how OpenGL and DirectX <em>work</em>. In practice you won’t write a software renderer for production use, but understanding how and why a renderer works will let you use OpenGL and DirectX more effectively.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is a fascinating topic - how do you make <em>Toy Story</em> out of algorithms and some geometric data? Interestingly enough, it’s a mysterious topic not only for the average cinema fan, but also for world-class engineers who just haven’t been exposed to it.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is also a frighteningly broad topic. From 3D rendering to photographic image filters, from fonts to particle systems, there’s a multitude of disciplines that can be categorized under CG. This work focuses exclusively on 3D rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Graphics from scratch</strong> is my humble attempt to demystify that slice of Computer Graphics in an accessible way. It can be easily understood by high-school students, while covering the same topics of an university course. It is, in fact, based on my years of teaching the subject at my university.</p>
<p>There’s little pre-requisite knowledge, nor hardware or software dependencies. The only primitive used in the book is a method that lets us set the color of a pixel - hence <strong>“from scratch”</strong>. The algorithms are conceptually simple, and the math is straightforward. There is some high-school level trigonometry. There’s some basic Linear Algebra as well, but I’m including an appendix that can be consulted as necessary.</p>
<p>This work is divided in two main parts, <strong>Raytracing</strong> and <strong>Rasterization</strong>, which focus on the two main ways to make pretty pictures out of data. The <strong>Common concepts</strong> chapter introduces some basic knowledge necessary to understand these two parts.</p>
<p>The focus of this work is not on performance, but on clear conceptual exposition. The sample code is, well, <em>sample code</em>, written in the most <em>clear</em> way possible, which may not be the most <em>efficient</em> way to implement the algorithms. Where there are different ways to do something, I’ve chosen the easiest to understand.</p>
<p>The “end result” of this work is two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer and a rasterizer. Although they follow very different approaches, they produce similar results when used to render a simple scene:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-1.png">
</figure>
<p>While their sets of features have considerable overlap, they aren’t identical, so this book covers their specific strengths:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-2.png">
</figure>
<p>The book provides sample code throughout the text, as somewhat informal pseudocode; it also provides fully working implementations written in JavaScript that can run directly on your browser, rendering to a <code>canvas</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="why-read-this">Why read this?</h2>
<p>This work should give you all the knowledge necessary to write software renderers. Although in the age of GPUs few people have good reasons to write a pure software renderer, the experience of writing one is valuable for the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Shaders</strong>. The first GPUs had their algorithms hardcoded in hardware, but in modern ones you’re expected to write your own shaders. In other words, you’re still implementing big chunks of rendering software, except it now runs on the GPU.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding</strong>. Whether you’re using a fixed pipeline or writing your own shaders, <em>understanding</em> what’s going on behind the scenes lets you use the fixed pipeline better and write better shaders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fun</strong>. Few areas of Computer Science have the kind of immediately visible results offered by Computer Graphics. The sense of accomplishment you get when your SQL query runs just right is <em>nothing</em> compared to what you feel the first time you get ray traced reflections right. I taught Computer Graphics at my university for 5 years. I often wondered why I enjoyed teaching the same thing semester after semester for so long; in the end, what made it worth it was seeing the faces of my students light up and use their first renders as desktop backgrounds.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h2>
<p>This is a work in progress. Here’s a non-exhaustive to do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture filtering</li>
<li>Normal mapping</li>
<li>Textures in the raytracer</li>
<li>Shadows in the rasterizer (stencil and shadow maps)</li>
<li>Reflection in the rasterizer</li>
<li>Expand the CSG and Refraction sections into chapters</li>
<li>Linear algebra appendix</li>
<li>Make demos interactive</li>
<li>Clean up demo code</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m a senior software engineer at Google. In the past I’ve worked at <a href="http://improbable.io/">Improbable</a>, who have a good shot at building the Matrix, for real (or at the very least revolutionizing multiplayer game development), and at <a href="http://mysterystudio.com/">Mystery Studio</a>, a game development company I founded and ran for about a decade, and which released almost 20 games you probably never heard of.</p>
<p>I taught Computer Graphics for five years at university, where it was a semester-long third-year subject. I am grateful to all of my students, who served as unwitting guinea pigs for the materials that inspired this book.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://antranigv.am/weblog_en/posts/macos_to_freebsd/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://antranigv.am/weblog_en/posts/macos_to_freebsd/">archive.org</a>

        <p>I think the title tells a lot about the story I’m going to tell you.</p>
<p>This is not a technical documentation for how I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD. This is a high-level for <em>why</em> I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, I was using macOS as my daily driver. The main reason why I got a macbook was the underlying BSD Unix and the nice graphics it provides. Also, I have an iPhone. But they were also the same reasons for why I <strong>left</strong> macOS.</p>
<p>I did not want to write this post right after the migration, I wanted to take my time, use FreeBSD daily, see if I will ever miss macOS.</p>
<p>Here’s a tweet of mine from 8 months ago</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Every 4 months I look at my systems (servers, laptops, desktops, embedded) to see if there's anything suspicious, if anything got hacked, etc.</p><p>man, I did not realize that macOS is that complicated. Why is there a "studentd" running? I don't even use Classrooms :/</p></div>— Antranig Vartanian (@antranigv) <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1234753346600394752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>Let’s look at it this way. macOS is becoming less Unix-y every year, <code>date(1)</code> is outdated, there are 100+ Unix processes running by the time the system is booted, most of them are useless for the general user, it has no native package manager (at least MacPorts/homebrew/pkgsrc is out there) and for a power user, there is no proper documentation. Have you ever checked the FreeBSD handbook? Everything is right there!</p>
<p>Okay, the nice graphics part. Have you seen the latest and greatest Big Sur? It feels like eye-candy, it’s not made for power users at all, everything seems to be a distraction now, even the icons. I’m no UI guru, but bringing iOS to the desktop is not for everyone.</p>
<p>So I decided to move to FreeBSD. This is where many people will tell me “Okay but not everything works outside the box”, true! but which OS works outside the box these days anyway? Windows is still a nightmare, setting up macOS took me 3 days the last time, Linux takes way more if you’re building it from scratch. Setting up FreeBSD took me 3 days, however this meant that I will NOT need to change it again for a very, very, VERY long time.</p>
<p>Every time Apple pushed an updated, my <code>pf.conf</code> and <code>automount</code> configs got broken on macOS. They either got deleted or they moved somewhere. Well, the last 2 times it just got deleted.</p>
<p>On FreeBSD, I upgraded from <code>12.1-RELEASE</code> to <code>12.2-RELEASE</code> and nothing broke, and in case there were any changes, FreeBSD just asked me what to do about them.</p>
<p>Let’s come back for a second. Unix is outdated and Apple does not care about it, fancy graphics are too fancy now. Doing forensics is almost impossible. And the hardware is, well, not the best out there (have you ever disassembled a MacBook Pro? it’s takes 2 hours to change a battery while I can reassemble my Dell Latitudes and ThinkPads in 30 minutes).</p>
<p>So there was no reason to stay here anymore. I had to migrate. The question is: where?</p>
<p>Linux has systemd, not my favorite thing out there, Windows is privacy nightmare. That left me with 2 major options: Linuxes without systemd (Gentoo, in my case) or BSDs.</p>
<p>Since I run FreeBSD servers anyway, I just migrated to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Here’s a short review about running FreeBSD on ThinkPad T480s.</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi: works. not the fastest, but fast enough.</li>
<li>Graphics: works.</li>
<li>Touchpad: works with multiple fingers AND very configurable via <code>sysctl</code>.</li>
<li>BT does discovery and pairs, I still have to try it with non-Apple headphones.</li>
<li>COVID-19 era: Zoom, Google Hangouts, Jitsi and all other WebRTC-based video conferencing software works via web as well.</li>
<li>Thanks to <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/linuxulator-how-to-run-google-chrome-linux-binary-on-freebsd.77559/">Linuxulator</a>, I can watch Netflix as well: <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1327422687107555329">here’s a screenshot</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, it’s Free and Open Source.</p>
<p>It’s been 1 month and 1 day since I last touched my MacBook Pro, so, what do I miss?</p>
<ul>
<li>Better BT support</li>
<li>Faster WiFi</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, that’s all missing on a FreeBSD laptop these days. WiFi can do 48Mbps according to <code>ifconfig</code> but I usually get 10-20Mbps. BT pairs with my Apple AirPods but I wish it worked till the end.</p>
<p>Having a nice workstation/laptop is not an easy thing, using macOS means living by Apple rules, Windows is the same for Microsoft. The BSDs gave me the power to be as free as possible :)</p>
<p>During the next weeks I’ll try to blog about the actual setup.</p>
<p>P.S. dear Apple employee, in case you’re reading this, please tell your management to update their BSD Unix layer. Some of us still care, some of us are not just Docker people, some of us are not just “modern” web developers. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>That’s all folks! :)</p>

        <strong>Rebase</strong> is a new conference for and by practitioners who want to engage academics about tomorrow's technologies while fondly recalling the achievements of yesterday.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This year, <strong>Rebase</strong> was planned to occur twice, once in Berlin
        with the <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> conference and
        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.
        Due to outside forces, there will be a single virtual event.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase</strong> will use the Clowdr platform for interaction,
        registration allows attendees to ask questions and meet with each other
        and with speaker. Registration also give access to all of the
        <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> co-located events.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase is free. All talks were streamed live and are now available on <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp6aNlOgiyE4W30X7DpXx74m"><i></i>&nbsp;YouTube</a>.</strong>

Made in Japan in 2005</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, I would like to show something different, than usual reverse-engineering, that appears on my blog usually. I needed to prepare a Linux distro for myself to be able to run it on my PC. But not the ordinary operating system that we download from webpage, then use fancy graphical installer to select, what we want and where. My goals were very specific. First was to have it custom-compiled. With that in mind there aren’t many choices left (maybe Gentoo?). Second was to not cross 16 MiB boundary. Why exactly that? That’s simple. I have old (15 years old to be precise) SD/MMC card made for Canon of exactly that size. Quick check showed me that this is possible. I tried buildroot and it failed to fulfill second requirement and I decided not to continue, despite the obvious optimizations on kernel modules, I could do. It’s simply too complex for such a simple task. If not buildroot, then let’s go and see how to do such thing from scratch!</p>

<p>Basically the plan is to have custom Linux distro compiled from scratch. It may sound like something incredibly complex and hard to do. But it’s not. There are just few problems one must learn on how to overcome. The most problematic constraint in my case is, obviously, 16 MiB limit. To not exceed it, I have to use busybox as my userspace. This by the way simplifies distro development significantly. Busybox works the way, that, if linked statically, requires only one, single binary to be able to work correctly. So, to sum up, on software side, we need Linux and busybox. You may wonder, how do I want to boot that system, then? Well. I said I need Linux 🙂 Maybe some people know, some does not, that Linux is itself a boot loader of some kind. At least, when using UEFI and this is what I want to use, it can be loaded directly by UEFI firmware. But that’s another thing to note – I will describe a way to prepare a distro for UEFI – it won’t be as simple as that, for legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>The whole plan will look as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get compiler</li>
<li>Compile Linux kernel</li>
<li>Compile busybox (statically and stripped!)</li>
<li>Prepare initramfs with whole userspace</li>
<li>Format drive as EFI System Partition</li>
<li>Combine kernel and initramfs into single binary</li>
<li>Optionally sign the binary, in case we want Secure Boot to be enabled</li>
<li>Add entry to embedded UEFI boot manager</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to show few ways to debug the system, in case of any problems.<span id="more-1624"></span></p>

<p>This is maybe not so obvious, but you need new compiler. Most likely, you could use the one that your distro provides, aliased as simply gcc. But this way, you will by the way use glibc as your standard library. For a lightweight system, glibc does not fit well, as this is most heavyweight libc, we have available. Therefore, I will use uClibc. And for that, we need a compiler. Or, to be precise, a toolchain. A toolchain, consisting of kernel headers, uClibc and gcc. Here, I could show, how to build such thing from scratch. But it’s not a tutorial about building a toolchain. This requires knowledge that can fill another tutorial. Instead, I will use the toolchain prepared by my latest project – <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cc-factory</a>. For those, who did not read <a href="https://re-ws.pl/2020/10/meet-cc-factory-a-factory-for-cross-compilers/">my previous post</a>, it is toolchain factory running in Docker container, that provides a recipe for a toolchain that just works. If you tried compiling a toolchain from scratch in the past, then you know that this can fail, even if you use crosstool-ng. With cc-factory, it works as long as Docker can start a service and has Docker Hub working. But enough of that. In cc-factory, I am experimenting with releasing binary distributions of my toolchain. And <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/tag/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1">newest one</a> is special-made for this job. You can simply download it to you disk with:</p>
<pre>wget <span>'</span><span>https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/download/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1.tar.gz</span><span>'</span>
</pre>
<p>After that, you have to install it to your <code>/opt</code> directory with:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> x86_64-gcc10.<span>2</span>.0-linux5.<span>9</span>.13-uclibc1.<span>0</span>.36-1.tar.gz <span>-C</span> /
</pre>
<p>If you prefer another installation path, then head onto cc-factory project to see, how to build one from source. Then, you can choose whatever path, you like for this SDK.</p>
<p>Next step is to export SDK’s bin directory to you PATH for convenience:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:/opt/x86_64-linux-uclibc/bin</span><span>"</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, it’s nice to check, if toolchain works. Let’s write one-liner C hello world program to your temp directory, compile and run:</p>
<pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>'</span><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {printf("Hello, World!\\n");}</span><span>'</span> <span>&gt;</span>/tmp/main.c
x86_64-linux-uclibc-gcc <span>-static</span> <span>-o</span> /tmp/main /tmp/main.c
/tmp/main
</pre>
<p>And you should see the familiar text on your screen. You are ready to go!</p>

<p>That is, in my opinion, the easiest part. First, we have to download kernel image, that we want to use. For that purpose, we need to go to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernel Archives</a> and download latest stable tarball. Optionally, we can download PGP signature and verify its correctness. But this is outside the scope of this tutorial. Another option to get kernel is to clone its stable repo with:</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
</pre>
<p>This is the path, I chose, because I don’t like leaving multiple copies of kernel sources on my hard drive, so I prefer to have one, central clone of repo and use for any project, I need it to.</p>
<p>In case of tarball, it now has to be unpacked with usual:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> linux-*.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Then, in case of tarball, you got directory with name dependent on you kernel version, in case of git repo, it is simply linux. So we can cd into it, in any of the above cases:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> linux*
</pre>
<p>In theory at this point, we could set the compiler, we prepared to be run by kernel buildsystem. But this is optional, as we target <code>x86_64</code> platform, that we run our host on, so default compiler should be as good as uClibc variant. I case, you want to use custom one, you have to export the following:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>CROSS_COMPILE</span>=x86_64-linux-uclibc-
</pre>
<p>Now, we have to configure our kernel.</p>
<p>First step is to choose defconfig. Possible values can be listed in case of x86 with:</p>
<pre><span>ls</span> arch/x86/configs/
</pre>
<p>At the time of writing this returned the following options:</p>
<pre>i386_defconfig tiny.config x86_64_defconfig xen.config
</pre>
<p>As you can see, there are only a few. So, we do:</p>
<pre>make x86_64_defconfig
</pre>
<p>At this point, we are ready to compile. In case, you want to do some modifications, you could do:</p>
<pre>make menuconfig
</pre>
<p>And select (or deselect) some options there. If you think, you are ready, you can type:</p>
<pre>make <span>-j</span>
</pre>
<p>And wait couple of minutes (up to half an hour), depending on speed of your PC. Afterwards, you should see that <code>bzImage</code> has been made and is available at <code>arch/x86/boot/bzImage</code>. We can copy it somewhere in order to not accidentally start its recompilation:</p>
<pre>cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
</pre>
<h2>Testing on hardware</h2>
<p>At this point, it is possible to run the kernel on our system. If you don’t have Secure Boot enabled, then you can try to copy the kernel to you EFI System Partition (wherever it is, I will call this path <code>ESP</code> from now on). But first create new directory for your distro:</p>
<pre><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> ESP/EFI/linux
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ESP/EFI/linux/linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>I am changing the name in the meantime, as I heard that some systems does not like binaries without <code>.efi</code> extension. Now, we can try to boot.There is more than one way to do it. The one that works always is to utilize EFI firmware directly. But this one differs significantly between manufacturers, so if you prefer that one, please refer to his support pages. The other is to use one of existing tools. For sure KeyTool, that manages Secure Boot keys, is able to start any executable from ESP by browsing the filesystem. But the way I would like to show is, by using so called EFI shell. Why? Because EFI shell allows us to experiment with kernel parameters, by simply typing them, as we would start new user program. And, in fact, from EFI perspective, we simply start a new program.</p>
<p>There are many shells in the wild. I tried EDK2, that is available on Arch as <code>edk2-shell</code> package. It is then available at <code>/usr/share/edk2-shell/x64/Shell.efi</code> You can simply copy it to <code>ESP</code>, just like with kernel, then you have to add it to your EFI boot manager, or use boot manager that is able to autodetect it. You can find a bunch of resources on how to do it, even from inside Linux. But, please do not add the kernel, you copied in such way, to boot manager, as we will play with it a bit, later. Now, in EFI shell, you will be presented with a list of partitions, that the shell has detected. This might be not so obvious at first, but, somehow, you have to identify the one, that is you EFI partition. You should see a similar numbering to the one you see in Linux console, when you list with e.g. <code>lsblk</code>. You can try guessing it by typing its name, in similar way as in Windows, e.g.:</p>
<pre>FS0:
</pre>
<p>to switch to <code>FS0</code> partition. Then you can simply type ls to list its content. Once, you found the right one, it’s worth to remember it, as you might need it couple of times. How many, depends on how many problems, you would have.</p>
<p>Then go to the directory, where you copied your kernel:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> EFI\linux
</pre>
<p>And ls to make sure, it is there. Now, we are ready to call it:</p>
<pre>linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>Yes. It’s as simple as that. But this will fail. We did not provide any root filesystem for our kernel, so it will gonna panic. But don’t worry, as long as reason of the panic is like that:</p>
<pre>not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>
<p>then it was expected. In case of any other error, act accordingly, as this may be hardware dependent. So, probably, something has to be reconfigured in menuconfig.</p>
<h2>Testing in qemu</h2>
<p>It’s quite a nice option to be able to test your work on real hardware. However, in my opinion, it is much easier to do it in virtualized environment, that you can quickly reset at any time and where you would have latest binaries for testing, all the time, without wasting time for flashing them somewhere. Therefore I recommend to prepare qemu as such environment.</p>
<p>For that, you will need …</p></div></article></div>

Every day until December 24th you will get an article, video or other functional programming related content that hopefully will make the waiting feel a bit shorter! 😄</p>
</section><article><section><p>As previous years the articles will span a large range of topics and complexity. If you are looking for something beginner friendly, or more advanced topics, there should be something for everyone these next 23 days.</p>
<p>Let’s start this advent of with a look at the basics: what is functional programming (FP)? This question has been answered many times before, in many different ways. <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/1">We took our own stab at it last year</a>. Even though there are no single definition for FP and many different ways to approach it, there are some things that are shared throughout the related communities.</p>

<p>Today I want to use the words and pictures of Russ Olsen and highlight his talk from GOTO 2018. Russ is a great communicator and I love the down to earth and practical perspective he brings in this talk. He explains functional programming in an understandable way and shows why people prefer FP. I hope you enjoy! </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The QEMU Advent Calendar 2020 features a QEMU disk image each day of
          December until the 24th. Each day a new package becomes available
          for download.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every download contains a little 'run' shell script that starts the
          QEMU emulator with the recommended parameters for the disk image.
          Disk images are either contained directly in the download or are
          downloaded by the 'run' script (you need to have installed 'curl' or
          'wget' in that case).
        </p>
        <p>
          The disk images contain interesting operating systems and software
          that run under the QEMU emulator. Some of them are well-known or
          not-so-well-known operating systems, old and new, others are custom
          demos and neat algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'run' scripts (and disk images if included in the download)
          were created by volunteers from the QEMU community to showcase cool
          software that QEMU can run.

Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>.

To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a>, and my personal Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/abhinavsharma">@abhinavsharma</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>
