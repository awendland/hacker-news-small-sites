Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.</p>  <p>Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.</p>  <p>"So we've now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That's the good news," he said. "That doesn't mean that the 17th won't."</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1842141251676-metadata-" title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/643/819/COVID-VARIANT-SCI-BIRAK-080121.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>The B1-17 coronavirus variant, first discovered in the U.K., is now in at least 40 countries, including Canada. It has 23 mutations, including one that attaches to healthy cells like a key going into a lock.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:56</span></span></span></p>  <p>Dormitzer said another mutation found in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation, was also concerning.</p>  <p>The researchers plan to run similar tests to establish whether the vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the British and South African variants and hope to have more data within weeks.</p>  <p>The variants are said by scientists to be more transmissible than previously dominant ones, but they are not thought to cause more serious illness.</p>  <p>The virus's spikes act as a key that must unlock our cells to cause the infection.&nbsp;The variant first identified in the U.K. has a mutation that appears to make it easier for the coronavirus to grab hold of the lock more tightly, scientists say.</p>    <p>Scientists said the results of the study would help calm concerns that people will not be protected by vaccines being given to millions of people around the world in the fight against the pandemic, which has killed more than 1.8 million people and roiled economies.</p>  <p>But they cautioned that more clinical tests and data are still needed to come to a definitive conclusion.</p>  <p>"This is good news, mainly because it is not bad news," said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the&nbsp;London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p>  <p>"So, yes this is good news, but it does not yet give us total confidence that the Pfizer (or other) vaccines will definitely give protection."</p>  <h2>AstraZeneca, Moderna, CureVac testing against variants</h2>  <p>AstraZeneca, Moderna and CureVac are also testing whether their shots work against the fast-spreading variants. They have said they expect them to be effective, but the timing of those studies is not known.</p>  <p>A senior British lawmaker expressed concerns in an interview on Friday that COVID-19 vaccines might not work properly against the South African variant. He was not responding to questions about Friday's data.</p>  <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc., which use synthetic messenger RNA technology, can be quickly tweaked to address new mutations of a virus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Graphic shows a diagram of the COVID-19 virus.<!-- --> <!-- -->(AP)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Some other vaccines to protect against COVID-19 also use the spike protein to show our immune system what the enemy looks like.</p>  <p>Canadian microbiologist Benjamin tenOever, a professor at the&nbsp;Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York,&nbsp;said our immune system learns to recognize and attack the viral attachment protein at many different sites.</p>  <p>"It would require many many mutations to render our vaccines non-effective,"&nbsp;tenOever&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>The variant is also not the first of the pandemic to emerge and Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, said these types of studies&nbsp;will be needed as they appear.</p>  <p>"It may be necessary to tweak the vaccine over time," she said.</p>  <p>Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Friday that 14 cases of the variant first reported in the U.K. have been reported in Canada.</p>  <p>Researchers in Ontario have developed a faster test to identify variants.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>In my <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-04-why-learning-fsharp-2021/">previous post</a>, I discussed how I’ve decided to learn F# in 2021 for a number of reasons. Around the same time, I also happened to setup my Sim Racing rig so that I could continue to play <a href="https://www.iracing.com/" target="_blank">iRacing</a> with my VR headset (HTC Vive). Its been several years since I’ve last played, but with COVID-related curfews being implemented here in Montreal tomorrow, I’ve been increasingly taking up home-based pursuits which I didn’t always have the time for pre-lockdown. Since the last time I played iRacing, I’m running a PC with a much better processor, motherboard, and only SSDs. The VR performance has been a huge leap forward since I used to play with my old machine and I was quite impressed. After spending a couple of hours setting up, here’s what my current humble racing setup looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/irsdk-fsharp/racing-rig.jpg" width="650" height="488" alt="Photo of my current iRacing VR setup"></p>

<p>Having a dedicated table really helps, as in my old apartment it was fairly difficult to setup a station with limited space, but now I can fortunately just jump in. Despite the past limitations, I was able to get fairly competitive and still remember the thrill of my first win agaisnt a field of real racers in a Mazda MX-5:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/irsdk-fsharp/iracing-win.jpg" width="500" height="279" alt="Photo of my iRacing first win certificate"></p>

<p>Inspired by setting everything up and doing some laps to practice for an eventual return to comeptition, I started thinking about how I once experimented with using the <a href="https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk" target="_blank">Python implementation</a> of the iRacing SDK to connect to an arduino and display a speedometer readout in realtime on a small screen. In reminiscing about the experience, I thought about how I could look into writing an F# implementation of the SDK as a learning project. In addition to learning through the project, it also has the benefit of being of use in a future project involving an iRacing stats tracker web app that I’ve been thinking about writing as a project for my upcoming <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-12-09-back-to-school/">cloud computing courses</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>I tend to learn best when projects are slightly outside of my comfort zone, and this would be both my first time writing a library, as well as writing one in a functional language! Having used an array of libraries at this point, I had some confidence in choosing an organizational structure, and the Python implementation is only <a href="https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk/blob/master/irsdk.py" target="_blank">739 lines of code</a> which felt doable compared to some of the larger libraries out there.</p>

<p>Moreover, the python implementation of the SDK has the ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get session data (WeekendInfo, SessionInfo, etc…)</li>
  <li>Get live telemetry data (Speed, FuelLevel, etc…)</li>
  <li>Broadcast messages (camera, replay, chat, pit and telemetry commands)</li>
</ul>

<p>and I figured that this would be a good featureset to aim for in the final version of the F# SDK. Out of these features, the session data and live telemetry data would be the ones I plan to implement first.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-library">Creating the Library</h2>

<p>After coming up with some desired features, the first step was to create a new FSharp solution called iRacingFSharp. Inside the solution, I created two projects. One was our actual library, called iRacingFSharp, and the other was a basic console app called SDKReader (located in the Examples Folder) to test the functionality of the library as I worked on it. Note, if you’d like to see the full codebase you can <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/irsdk-fsharp" target="_blank">here on github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-function">The First Function</h2>

<p>Starting small, I decided that a good first function would be to find out the state of the simulator. Fortunately, the iRacing SDK allows you to check if the sim is running using the following URL which points to a localhost server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:32034/get_sim_status?object=simStatus
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Getting this URL in Postman returns a JSON object which looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var simStatus={
   running:0 // 1 if the sim is running
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to make use of the <a href="https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/Http.html" target="_blank">F# Data HTTP library</a> in order to download the response and so I installed it from NuGet at this point.</p>

<p>Next, inside my iRacingFSharp project I created a file called Irsdk.fs and wrote the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span>

<span>open</span> <span>FSharp</span><span>.</span><span>Data</span>

<span>///&lt;summary&gt;F# implementation of the iRacing SDK.&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>module</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>///&lt;summary&gt;Returns the simStatus in string format&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>SimStatus</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>simStatusURL</span> <span>=</span> <span>"http://127.0.0.1:32034/get_sim_status?object=simStatus"</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>simStatusObject</span> <span>=</span> <span>Http</span><span>.</span><span>RequestString</span><span>(</span><span>simStatusURL</span><span>)</span>
        <span>simStatusObject</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, I’ve created a module which contains a function called SimStatus that takes no parameters. It then binds the JSON response to simStatusURL and passes it to the HTTP library via Http.RequestString(). Finally, simStatusObject is returned in string format which can be parsed further by another function in a later step.</p>



<p>With this simple function in place, the next step was to create SDKReader.fs inside my SDKReader console app. This file contained code to call the SimStatus() function and print the output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>argv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>test</span> <span>=</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span><span>.</span><span>SimStatus</span><span>()</span>
    <span>printf</span> <span>"%s"</span> <span>test</span>
    <span>0</span> <span>// return an integer exit code</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running dotnet build inside the SDKReader folder displayed the following output while iRacing was running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"var simStatus={
   running:1
};
"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! With this method working, we now have the very beginnings of an F# implementation of the iRacing SDK! Although it is a small step, we were also able to create and structure the project. Lastly, I also setup a a basic .NET build through Github Actions for CI.</p>



<p>iRacing’s API telemetry comes in three variations; data written to a .ibt file 60 times a second, live data exposed to the telemetry API 60 times per second, and a session string in YAML format that contains more or less static information about the session. The YAML string is appended to the end of the .ibt file but only a small portion of that data is exposed. This means that going forward, I’ll need to look into parsing the YAML as well as mapping more of the API endpoints. The iRacing API appears to be nonstandard and so it may take a little more work than just a typical REST API.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for Part Two where I plan to implement some telemetry functions and look into parsing the aforementioned YAML. In addition, be sure to follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/irsdk-fsharp" target="_blank">Github Repo here</a> if you’re interested in seeing how to project progresses (or would like to contribute)!</p>

        <h2>Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive</h2>
      </p>
      
        
      

      <div><p>Donald Trump loves to tweet and everyone knows that.
Twitter is his favorite medium to express his ideas and to communicate with the world.
He has been an active Twitter user since 2009. Much longer than many other world leaders.</p>
<p>Last month (May 2020) he tweeted 845 times â€” that's 28 tweets per day on average!</p>
<center>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/491324429184823296"><img src="https://pikaso.me/blog/files/pikaso.me-realDonaldTrump-20140721_205046-491324429184823296.png" alt="Trump Tweet" width="500" height="244"></a>
</center>
<p>A while ago we received a request from one of our users who was looking for a way to screenshot all Donald Trump tweets.
We realized that's a good opportunity to put <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a> into test and see if it can perform such a task without any problems.
It went smoothly and there was only an issue with one of his tweets which included a deleted image.</p>
<p>Today, we are releasing the resulting files to the public.
This archive contains screenshots of 43,475 Donald Trump tweets from May 2009 to May 2020.
Whether you are pro- or anti- Trump, this is an important part of Internet history that we believe should be preserved.</p>
<h3 id="download">Download</h3>
<p>The Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive can be downloaded through the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.zip">trump_twitter_archive_v1.zip</a> (Direct download, 2.6 GB)</li>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.torrent">trump_twitter_archive_v1.torrent</a> (Torrent download, 28.2 KB)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="howthiswasmade">How This Was Made?</h3>
<p>To create this archive, we first extracted all tweet ids from the realDonaldTrump.csv file that was provided to us.
That file only contained Donald Trump tweets up to March 29, 2020. To get the later tweets, we used <a href="http://trumptwitterarchive.com/">trumptwitterarchive.com</a>.</p>
<p>We then used the <a href="https://pikaso.me/api">Pikaso API</a> to screenshot each individual tweet.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<p>We have no plans to keep this archive up to date after the initial release.
However, if you are interested in doing so, you can use <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a>.
You can even <a href="https://pikaso.me/automate">automate</a> it so that each time he tweets, an automatic screenshot is taken.</p>

<p>For my own reflection, I wanted to write down what that means for performance and capacity/costs of apps, and what would be the impact on the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

<p>I will assume that the audience already knows the difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Threads_vs._processes_pros_and_cons" target="\_blank">threads vs processes model in UNIX</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law" target="\_blank">Little’s law</a>.</p>

<p>
Updated on Jan 9, 2021: thanks to the feedback from <a href="https://github.com/ioquatix" target="_blank">Samuel Williams</a>, I’ve revised the post with findings from <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon" target="_blank">Falcon</a>, the async web server written in Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="learning-from-python">Learning from Python</h2>

<p>It’s always good to take learnings from other languages. There’s an excellent <a href="http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html" target="\_blank">write-up “Async Python is not faster” by Cal Paterson</a>.</p>

<p>It argues that process-based (aka forking) web servers <strong>show better latencies for web requests</strong> when they are compared to async IO-powered servers.</p>

<p>But why? That’s because async IO brings co-operative scheduling, which means that the execution is only yielded upon language keywords like <code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Quoting the author, this means that execution time is not distributed “fairly” and one thread can inadvertently starve another of CPU time while it is working. This is why latency is more erratic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, traditional sync webservers use the pre-emptive multi-processing of the kernel scheduler, which works to ensure fairness by periodically swapping processes out from execution. This means that time is divided more fairly and that latency variance is lower.</p>

</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon">Falcon</a> is a multi-process, multi-fiber HTTP server written in Ruby that is already utilizing async IO.</p>

<p>It has a great <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon-benchmark">set of benchmarks</a> that let us compare Falcon’s async IO with other non-async web servers like Passenger, Puma and Unicorn. Those benchmarks have been showing that <strong>async IO-powered server like Falcon</strong> provides better latencies on web requests.</p>

<p>Interestingly, that’s a very different story than Python! Looking at Python, I’ve expected that the thread driven server should be more “balanced” but it turns out the opposite.</p>

<p>Falcon’s authors explain that the fiber scheduler naturally scales according to load much better than the worker pool implementation in Puma. When fibers are busy handling requests, they don’t call <code>accept</code> so the requests are naturally picked up by other workers who are less busy.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-that-mean-for-us-ruby-developers">What does that mean for us Ruby developers?</h3>

<p>Scheduling threads and fibers is nuanced, and you can see that similar approaches demonstrate different results on Python and Ruby/Falcon examples.</p>

<p>In the first revision of this post, I’ve argued that async IO may often increase the latency. Thanks to the data <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon-benchmark">shown</a> by Samuel Williams, we can see that’s not the case.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of async IO is that concurrency is archived by the <code>yield</code>/<code>await</code> instruction, not by the constant interrupt of threads. Every interrupt causes the context switch - and it’s nice to reduce context switching where we can because scheduler switching from one task to another always adds a little overhead. Since that happens thousands of times every second, <strong>less context switching would mean fewer CPU cycles wasted</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-ractor-fit-in">Where does Ractor fit in?</h2>

<p>The Ractor pattern allows parallel execution (which wasn’t possible in Ruby before) of more than one Ruby thread by limiting the shared state of a block of code that you want to execute in parallel. Those “blocks of code” (aka “actors”) can also talk to each other through messages. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actor model</a> used in other languages.</p>

<p>There are two ways we could leverage Ractors for modern apps: from the top (wrap every worker into a Ractor) and from the bottom (selectively use Ractors within existing code to parallelize CPU-intensive work).</p>

<p>While I see more to be gained from the top way, it seems like there’s so much shared and mutable state in Ruby libraries that it’s going to be quite tricky, although not impossible. It will likely take some efforts and at least a year of work from the community to push libraries towards less shared state. For the next year, we’ll mostly see Ractor maturing and getting adopted in the “bottom” use cases.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-ruby-ecosystem">Impact on the Ruby ecosystem</h2>

<p><strong>By itself, async IO will help to use CPU more efficiently by reducing context switching.</strong></p>

<p>Better support for async IO in Ruby 3.0 will increase community’s adoption of async web servers like Falcon, and will hopefully give birth to async background job systems.</p>

<p>Having Sidekiq execute jobs concurrently through the async IO and event loop instead of threads could increase the throughput and save CPU work, especially for IO-bound workloads like webhook delivery.</p>

<p><strong>We’ll need to push the Ruby ecosystem to have less shared state to fully leverage the Ractor pattern.</strong> That will take us some time.</p>

						<p><a href="https://0fps.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-1/">Last time</a> we formulated the problem of isosurface extraction and discussed some general approaches at a high level.&nbsp; Today, we’re going to get very specific and look at meshing in particular.</p>
<p>For the sake of concreteness, let us suppose that we have approximated our potential field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" title="f"> by sampling it onto a cubical grid at some fixed resolution.&nbsp; To get intermediate values, we’ll just interpolate between grid points using the standard <a href="http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/interpolation/">trilinear interpolation</a>.&nbsp; This is like a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%5E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C^0" title="C^0"> generalization of Minecraft-style voxel surfaces.&nbsp; Our goal in this article is to figure out how to extract a mesh of the implicit surface (or zero-crossings of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" title="f">).&nbsp; In particular, we’re going to look at three different approaches to this problem:</p>
<h2>Marching Cubes</h2>
<p>By far the most famous method for extracting isosurfaces is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes">marching cubes</a> algorithm. &nbsp;In fact, it is so popular that the term `marching cubes’ is even more popular than the term `isosurface’ (at least according to Google)!&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s quite a feat when an algorithm becomes more popular than the problem which it solves!&nbsp; The history behind this method is very interesting.&nbsp; It was originally <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37422">published back in SIGGRAPH 87</a>, and then summarily patented by the Lorensen and Cline. &nbsp;This fact has caused a lot of outrage, and is been widely cited as one of the classic examples of patents hampering innovation.&nbsp; Fortunately, the patent on marching cubes expired back in 2005 and so today you can freely use this algorithm in the US with no fear of litigation.</p>
<p>Much of the popularity of marching cubes today is due in no small part to a famous article written by <a href="http://paulbourke.net/">Paul Bourke</a>. &nbsp;Back in 1994 he made a webpage called <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/">“Polygonizing a Scalar Field”</a>, which presented a short, self-contained reference implementation of marching cubes (derived from some earlier work by Cory Gene Bloyd.)&nbsp; That tiny snippet of a C program is possibly <strong><em>the most copy-pasted code of&nbsp;<span>all time</span></em></strong>. &nbsp;I have seen some variation of Bloyd/Bourke’s code in <strong>every</strong> implementation of marching cubes that I’ve ever looked at, without exception.&nbsp; There are at least a couple of reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paul Bourke’s exposition is really good. &nbsp;Even today, with many articles and tutorials written on the technique, none of them seem to explain it quite as well.&nbsp; (And I don’t have any delusions that I will do any better!)</li>
<li>Also their implementation is very small and fast. &nbsp;It uses some clever tricks like a precalculated edge table to speed up vertex generation.&nbsp; It is difficult to think of any non-trivial way to improve upon it.</li>
<li>Finally, marching cubes is incredibly difficult to code from scratch.</li>
</ol>
<p>This last point needs some explaining, &nbsp;Conceptually, marching cubes is rather simple. &nbsp;What it does is sample the implicit function along a grid, and then checks the sign of the potential function at each point (either +/-). &nbsp;Then, for every edge of the cube with a sign change, it finds the point where this edge intersects the volume and adds a vertex (this is just like ray casting a bunch of tiny little segments between each pair of grid points).&nbsp; The hard part is figuring out how to stitch some surface between these intersection points.&nbsp; Up to the position of the zero crossings, there are&nbsp;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E8+%3D+256&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^8 = 256" title="2^8 = 256"> different possibilities, each of which is determined by the sign of the function at the 8 vertices of the cube:</p>

<p>Some of the marching cubes special cases. &nbsp;(c) Wikipedia, created by Jean-Marie Favreau.</p>
<p>Even worse, some of these cases are ambiguous!&nbsp; The only way to resolve this is to somewhat arbitrarily break the symmetry of the table based on a case-by-case analysis. What a mess!&nbsp; Fortunately, if you just download Bloyd/Bourke’s code, then you don’t have to worry about any of this and everything will just work. &nbsp;No wonder it gets used so much!</p>
<h2>Marching Tetrahedra</h2>
<p>Both the importance of isosurface extraction and the perceived shortcomings of marching cubes motivated the search for alternatives. &nbsp;One of the most popular was the <a href="http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e74-d_1_214">marching tetrahedra</a>, introduced by Doi and Koide.&nbsp; Besides the historical advantage that marching tetrahedra was not patented, it does have a few technical benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marching tetrahedra does not have ambiguous topology, unlike marching cubes.&nbsp; As a result, surfaces produced by marching tetrahedra are always manifold.</li>
<li>The amount of geometry generated per tetrahedra is much smaller, which might make it more suitable for use in say a geometry shader.</li>
<li>Finally, marching tetrahedra has only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E4+%3D+16&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^4 = 16" title="2^4 = 16"> cases, a number which can be further reduced to just 3 special cases by symmetry considerations. &nbsp;This is enough that you can work them out by hand.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exercise:&nbsp; </strong>Try working out the cases for marching tetrahedra yourself. &nbsp;(It is really not bad.)</p>
<p>The general idea behind marching tetrahedra is the same as marching cubes, only it uses a tetrahedral subdivision. &nbsp;Again, the standard reference for practical implementation is Paul Bourke (<a href="http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/polygonise/">same page as before</a>, just scroll down a bit.) &nbsp;While there is a lot to like about marching tetrahedra, it does have some draw backs. &nbsp;In particular, the meshes you get from marching tetrahedra are typically about 4x larger than marching cubes. &nbsp;This makes both the algorithm and rendering about 4x slower. &nbsp;If your main consideration is performance, you may be better off using a cubical method. &nbsp;On the other hand, if you really need a manifold mesh, then marching tetrahedra could be a good option. &nbsp;The other nice thing is that if you are obstinate and like to code everything yourself, then marching tetrahedra may be easier since there aren’t too many cases to check.</p>
<h2>The Primal/Dual Classification</h2>
<p>By now, both marching cubes and tetrahedra are quite old. &nbsp;However, research into isosurface extraction hardly stopped in the 1980s.&nbsp; In the intervening years, many new techniques have been developed. &nbsp;One general class of methods which has proven very effective are the so-called `dual’ schemes. &nbsp;The first dual method, surface nets, was proposed by Sarah Frisken Gibson in 1999:</p>
<p>S.F. Gibson, (1999) “<a href="http://www.merl.com/papers/docs/TR99-24.pdf" target="_blank">Constrained Elastic Surface Nets</a>”&nbsp; Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, Technical Report.</p>
<p>The main distinction between dual and primal methods (like marching cubes) is the way they generate surface topology.&nbsp; In both algorithms, we start with the same input: a volumetric mesh determined by our samples, which I shall take the liberty of calling a&nbsp;<em>sample complex</em> for lack of a better term.&nbsp; If you’ve never heard of the word&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inperc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Cell_complex">cell complex</a>&nbsp;before, you can think of it as an n-dimensional generalization of a triangular mesh, where the `cells’ or facets don’t have to be simplices.</p>
<p>In the sample complex, vertices (or 0-cells) correspond to the sample points; edges (1-cells) correspond to pairs of nearby samples; faces (2-cells) bound edges and so on:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="534" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/samplecomplex/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png" data-orig-size="533,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="samplecomplex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=533" title="samplecomplex" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=235" height="235" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Here is an illustration of such a complex. &nbsp;I’ve drawn the vertices where the potential function is negative black, and the ones where it is positive white.</p>
<p>Both primal and dual methods walk over the sample complex, looking for those cells which cross the 0-level of the potential function. &nbsp;In the above illustration, this would include the following faces:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="535" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/boundarycells/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png" data-orig-size="533,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="boundarycells" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=533" title="boundarycells" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=300&amp;h=235" height="235" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<h3>Primal Methods</h3>
<p>Primal methods, like marching cubes, try to turn the cells crossing the bounary into an isosurface using the following recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edges crossing the boundary become vertices in the isosurface mesh.</li>
<li>Faces crossing the boundary become edges in the isosurface mesh.</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>n-cells crossing the boundary become (n-1)-cells in the isosurface mesh.</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to construct a primal mesh for our sample complex would be the following:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="536" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/primalcomplex/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png" data-orig-size="533,424" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="primalcomplex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=533" title="primalcomplex" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=238" height="238" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=238 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=150&amp;h=119 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>This is pretty nice because it is easy to find intersection points along edges. &nbsp;Of course, there is some topological ambiguity in this construction.&nbsp; For non-simplicial cells crossing the boundary it is not always clear how you would glue the cells together:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="537" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/primalcell/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png" data-orig-size="929,198" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="primalcell" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=640" title="primalcell" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=300&amp;h=63" height="63" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=296&amp;h=63 296w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=591&amp;h=126 591w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=150&amp;h=32 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=300&amp;h=64 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>As we have seen, these ambiguities lead to exponentially many special cases, and are generally a huge pain to deal with.</p>
<h3>Dual Methods</h3>
<p>Dual methods on the other hand use a very different topology for the surface mesh.&nbsp; Like primal methods, they only consider the cells which intersect the boundary, but the rule they use to construct surface cells is very different:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every edge crossing the boundary, create an (n-1) cell.&nbsp; (Face in 3D)</li>
<li>For every face crossing the boundary, create an (n-2) cell. (Edge in 3D)</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>For every d-dimensional cell, create an (n-d) cell.</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>For every n-cell, create a vertex.</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates a much simpler topological structure:</p>

<p>The nice thing about this construction is that unlike primal methods, the topology of the dual isosurface mesh is completely determined by the sample complex (so there are no ambiguities).&nbsp; The disadvantage is that you may sometimes get non-manifold vertices:</p>

<h2>Make Your Own Dual Scheme</h2>
<p>To create your own dual method, you just have to specify two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A sample complex.</li>
<li>And a rule to assign vertices to every n-cell intersecting the boundary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second item is the tricky part, and much of the research into dual methods has focused on exploring the possibilities. &nbsp;It is interesting to note that this is the opposite of primal methods, where finding vertices was pretty easy, but gluing them together consistently turned out to be quite hard.</p>
<h3>Surface Nets</h3>
<p>Here’s a neat puzzle: what happens if we apply the dual recipe to a regular, cubical grid&nbsp;(like we did in marching cubes)? &nbsp;Well, it turns out that you get the same boxy, cubical meshes that you’d make in a Minecraft game (topologically speaking)!</p>
<p><a href="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/exampledualmesh.png"><img title="exampledualmesh" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/exampledualmesh.png?w=150&amp;h=145" height="145" width="150"></a><a href="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/spheresmoothed.png"><img title="spheresmoothed" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/spheresmoothed.png?w=150&amp;h=138" height="138" width="150"></a></p>
<p>Left: A dual mesh with vertex positions snapped to integer coordinates.&nbsp; Right: A dual mesh with smoothed vertex positions.</p>
<p>So if you know how to <a href="https://0fps.wordpress.com/2012/06/30/meshing-in-a-minecraft-game/">generate Minecraft meshes</a>, then you already know how to make smooth shapes! &nbsp;All you have to do is squish your vertices down onto the isosurface somehow. &nbsp;How cool is that?</p>
<p>This technique is called “surface nets” (remember when we mentioned them before?) &nbsp;Of course the trick is to figure out where you place the vertices. &nbsp;In Gibson’s original paper, she formulated the process of vertex …</p></div></div>

<p>Four years ago, after the unthinkable happened and the wrong guy won the US election of 2016. <a href="https://easydns.com/blog/2017/02/24/the-cultural-purge-will-not-be-televised/">I wrote an article</a> about how I had feared a type of “cultural purge” from within the corporate media, Big Tech and cancel culture spheres. Like everybody else, I didn’t expect Trump to win (like most other Libertarians, I was holding my nose and pulling for Gary Johnson, whose running mate, Bill Weld, endorsed Hillary Clinton <em>during the election campaign).</em></p>
<p>What I expected then, after Trump would have unceremoniously lost the 2016 election,&nbsp; was a type of cultural purge against anybody and everybody who enabled his run or supported him. What surprised me was that after he won the cultural purge proceeded anyway. In retrospect it seems obvious, at the time it blindsided me.<span id="more-1501"></span></p>
<p>For the next four years we watched any (remaining) semblance of objectivity and impartiality wither away from the mainstream media. Even more troubling, was that it was also happening within<em>&nbsp;</em>Big Tech. Everything polarized and all judgement calls became characteristically asymmetrical. As I noted on occasion, that compared to the post 9/11 era when the Neocons controlled the narrative and the word “liberal” was a slur, everything flipped. Now it was the word “conservative” that was unusable and being a single micron to the right of centre was equated with being “literally Hitler”.</p>
<p>I could list the countless examples of deplatformings, cancellations, character assassinations and careers destroyed in the intervening time. It became so ridiculous, so devoid of any attempt at a claim to due process or fairness that an entire counter-culture has formed around criticizing or ridiculing it. <a href="https://easydns.com/blog/2019/10/22/unassailable-the-book-that-protects-you-from-cancel-culture-and-deplatform-attacks/">I wrote a book</a> about <a href="https://easydns.com/blog/2019/10/22/unassailable-the-book-that-protects-you-from-cancel-culture-and-deplatform-attacks/">defending from deplatform attacks</a>, which I started <a href="https://axisofeasy.com/aoe/the-missing-manual-for-defending-yourself-against-deplatforming-and-cancel-culture/">giving away for free</a> in April when Big Tech started deplatforming deviant reporting on the COVID-19 crisis. Babylon Bee sprang into existence and quickly rivalled The Onion, <a href="https://babylonbee.com/news/op-ed-anyone-who-claims-cancel-culture-is-real-is-a-bigot-who-should-lose-his-job">riffing on cancel culture</a> and hitting headwinds on multiple occasions when their scathing satire <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/twitter-apologizes-mistakenly-suspending-babylon-154401646.html">was indistinguishable from the reality</a> they were lampooning.</p>
<div id="attachment_1511"><p><a href="https://babylonbee.com/news/op-ed-anyone-who-claims-cancel-culture-is-real-is-a-bigot-who-should-lose-his-job"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1511" loading="lazy" src="https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/oped-e1610129919714.png" alt="" width="800" height="745"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1511">TL,DR: Cancel culture is a right-wing conspiracy promulgated by Qanon Incels</p></div>
<p>More than once I thought “This is it, this has to be Peak Outrage”, and then somebody else’s career or business would be destroyed, sometimes for imagined transgressions that may or may not have taken place years ago or even before the target even started a position they’d just been canceled from having (David Collum’s section on cancel culture, featuring his own cancelation, lays many of these out in his famous Year In Review series, <a href="https://www.peakprosperity.com/dave-collum-2020-year-in-review-part-2/#cancelculture">the 2020 issue</a>).</p>
<p>Once the 2020 election was finally in the rear-view mirror and it appeared likely the administration had changed I thought, once again, that the worst was over. The world was mired in lockdown fatigue, we’re not even dealing with the economic fallout of COVID yet, and “ding dong the witch is dead”. Surely cancel culture and social justice extremism would taper off, if only out of exhaustion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">i’m fucking exhausted <a href="https://t.co/gjmsQtgBFh">pic.twitter.com/gjmsQtgBFh</a></p>
<p>— Jordan Lancaster (@jordylancaster) <a href="https://twitter.com/jordylancaster/status/1316065323595034628?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>Boy am I wrong, again.</h2>
<p>The ignominy with which TheDonald has chosen to close out his term, the lack of humility, of which is he likely congenitally incapable of, will instead reignite the flames of the culture wars and propel them to new heights. As investing legend (and Fed critic) Bill Fleckinstein observed in his subscriber note yesterday, there is a right way and a wrong way to go out, even if you feel like you got shafted:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the subject of yesterday’s violence, although it is unlikely to have long-lasting economic impacts and thus is largely in the realm of politics, which I tend to avoid, I think there is a worthwhile lesson to point out. Obviously, Trump’s worst qualities, which stem from his being a petulant egomaniac, have been on display since he lost the election and I’m reminded of a very valuable lesson I learned from my investment business mentor, who told me that when you get fired by a client (yes, that happens), rather than be upset and act petulantly what you should say is, “How can I make the transition easier for you?”</p>
<p>In other words, you turn a loss into a bit of a victory by being a class act. I can’t tell you how many times over my investment career when that lesson and corollaries to it have been quite useful, and no matter what, trying to comport yourself in such a manner pays big dividends over time in my opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Fleck, I don’t even want to get into the gory details of the events of Jan 6, the storming of the capital, the riots, other than to say that when we talk about the twilight of the nation state and the rise of the Network State <a href="https://axisofeasy.com/salon">in our #AxisOfEasy podcasts,</a> these are the sort of disorderly episodes we fear punctuating or worse, defining, this oncoming societal shift.</p>
<p>We certainly seem to be <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/670089.The_Fourth_Turning">into The Fourth Turning now</a>, a book I have been rereading and was just finishing up listening to the day of the DC riots. Their prescience is creepy, especially as they outlined the “climax” phase of the Crisis period, which, by their reckoning started around… 2020 and would last another 6 to 10 years:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>One or both of today’s dominant parties could go the way of the Whigs…History warns that when a crisis catalyzes, a previously dominant political party or regime can find itself perceived or blamed for direct mistakes that led to the national emergency.</p>
<p>Whoever holds power when the Fourth Turning arrives could find themselves joining the ranks of the 14th century Lancastrians, circa 15th century Catholics, circa 1680 Stewarts, circa 1770 Tories, circa 1860 Democrats, and circa 1929 Republicans. That party could find itself out of power for a generation.</p>
<p>Key persons associated with it could find themselves defamed, stigmatized, harassed, economically ruined, or even personally punished”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since that day, Big Tech and corporate media moved at a new speed that I found dizzying. Twitter pile-ons are ugly enough spectacles and that’s just watching end-users gang up on the sacrificial deviant of the day. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol">watching&nbsp;<em>Shopify</em></a> of all companies, pile on to Facebook and Twitter’s deplatforming of a sitting president (which at this moment he is, like it or not), <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/07/media/josh-hawley-book-canceled/index.html">Simon and Schuster canceling their contract</a> to publish Sen Josh Hawley’s book <em>on Big Tech censorship</em> (which I wanted to read) and I’m sure the list will go on after I’m done writing, this is just fucking crazy.</p>
<p>(I paused writing this to take a meeting, an hour later I come back to finishing it off and a friend, who fled Chicago this past summer because of the complete breakdown of civil order there, among other US cities at that time, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2021/1/7/22219360/trump-rally-capitol-tank-noodle-insight-studios-properties">sent me this story</a>. It outlines numerous other firings and cancelations of Chicagoans who attended the DC rally (but not necessarily involved in the violence), and businesses who even commented in social media about it.</p>
<div id="attachment_23289"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23289" loading="lazy" src="https://axisofeasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/properties-1024x374.png" alt="" width="1024" height="374"></p><p id="caption-attachment-23289">Translation: a social media mob demanded we cancel one of our employees with zero due process or time to consider, so we did. <strong>Who do you want us to fire next?</strong></p></div>
<h2><strong><em>Think it through people.</em> </strong></h2>
<p>Do you want to live in a society where Facebook and Twitter decide not only what is <em>permissible</em> to say but even <em>which narratives can be explored</em> and which ones can’t?</p>
<p>Yes I know, “private companies, their own AUP, blah blah blah” – I’m a libertarian and a tech company CEO, so I know all this. I’ll preempt these objections with what I said in my book, which is that when tech companies base platform/deplatform decisions on something that is happening&nbsp;<em>outside&nbsp;</em>of their platforms, they are in effect, exercising jurisprudence and adjudicating international law. All any company can competently assess is what is happening on within their respective platforms, how their employees are fulfilling their roles and serving the businesses customers <em>and nothing else.</em></p>
<p>Would you be ok with your employer firing you if enough strangers who don’t know you, don’t do business with your company and have no first hand knowledge of events or what your circumstances are scream at your boss to cut you loose?</p>
<p>Do you want contracts to be subject to negation by&nbsp; public sentiment of events 2 or 3 or more degrees separated from the contracted parties?</p>
<p>Do you want to have every aspect of your life scrutinized by somebody else’s measure of moral and ideological purity before you can say anything online? How about before you can book a hotel room? Fill up your car with gas? Go shopping? Get on a plane?</p>
<p>After all, we have big data and AI now, <em>so this is all doable.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Do you really want to live within the constraints of a type of societal social credit system where your every action, <em>your very thoughts</em> are bounded by external and ever shifting, subjective and <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/merriam-webster-modifies-word-definition-after-left-manufactures-offensive-meaning-for-it/">revisionist social mores</a>? Many of them defined by the most oversensitive, self-absorbed hysterics on social media?</p>
<p>Be very careful if you think this is a good thing, because sooner or later, you’re going to be on the wrong side of it. By then it’ll be too late.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>Around the end of 2019, as we were going through our few last months of
engineering school, we ended up having a quite consequent amount of free
time due to the highly irregular organisation of courses throughout the year.</p>

<p>Daniel, a friend of mine from school who has
been a huge fan of chess for a while now told us one night about how he read 
about this chess variant with three players and how he thought it would be
interesting to build a game engine for it.</p>

<p>Since I had time to <del>waste</del> spend building something <del>funny</del> meaningful,
I was interested in getting involved in this project to make it grow and be
something more than only a game engine (which I thought nobody would use
anyway, since playing chess through command line on a single computer does not
seem that appealing).</p>

<p>That’s how, Daniel, Vincent (another friend from school with whom I had
worked on many side projects), and I decided that we were going to build a
website so that people could come and play chess with two of their
friends.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-three-player-chess">What is three-player chess?</h2>

<p>Some might wonder what really is 3-player chess, do the rules change
when introducing a third player, and if they do, how?</p>

<p>Even though 3-player chess seems like a simple and precise concept, there are many variations
with light differences and not one set of rules for 3-player chess. These different
variations come in variants with different names (Trichess, Chess for three, Three-Player
Chess, Yalta chess…) but not every mention of one variant describes the same rules and
there is a huge lack of norm here.</p>

<p>The variation of chess played on <a href="https://yalta-chess.com/">yalta-chess.com</a> can be
considered as a unique variant, but mostly inspired by <strong>Yalta Chess</strong> (not much suspense
here) from which we tried to follow the rules as much as possible, but once again, the rules
differed depending on the articles.</p>

<p>On our website, you’ll play on a 96-cell board (32 for each player, just like usual chess).</p>

<p><img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-animation4.gif" alt="Yalta board"></p>

<p>The moves are the same as classic chess, but it can take some time to get used to the
moves around the center or the board when starting to play <strong>Yalta Chess</strong>. The only real difference
with 2-player chess is how winners and losers are handled.</p>

<p>The winner is the first player to checkmate another player, meaning that there are one
winner and two losers. This makes the game more interesting, rewarding aggressive strategies
since playing too defensive might end up in a loss where one of the other players checkmated
the third player.</p>

<h2 id="early-development">Early development</h2>

<p>Our initial goal was pretty simple and seemed easy to accomplish, the
tasks which needed to be done could have been summed up as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building a game engine, implementing every rule and move.</li>
  <li>Having a game page on which 3 players could play together with a decent user
experience.</li>
  <li>Having a basic matchmaking system, so that players could join games easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>It looked easy and fast, the game engine was the main challenge since the special
shape of the board made the classic 2-player chess implementation unsuitable for
our needs and we needed to come up with a smart way to handle the board. Once the
game engine was out of the way, the only remaining thing would be to build a simple
website with basic functionalities.</p>

<p>Two of us already had some web development knowledge which we acquired through previous
side-projects, I would not say that we were <strong>amazing</strong> (or good) web developers,
but we were at least decent. Well, for the backend at least, our UI/UX level was (and
still is, but those who saw the website already know that) pretty bad.</p>

<p>Since we weren’t looking for high performances in our game engine because a few
milliseconds were not going to impact the user experience, building the engine was
actually pretty fast. One of us focused on it, and after a few days we had a game engine
implementing the rules and about everything we needed except <em>promotions</em>, <em>castling</em>, and
<em>en passant</em> which came later.</p>

<p>Our implementation relied on the fact that instead of using one 8x8 board as in 2-player
chess, we considered the board as 3 distinct 4x8 sub-boards, each sub-board filled with a
different color on the example below: 
<img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-subboards.png" alt="Yalta debug mode"></p>

<p>The website, on the other hand, was way more complicated than we anticipated, handling
concurrent plays with real-time information transfer between the players (without
refreshing after each move) and implementing a decent user experience was much more
challenging than we expected.</p>

<p>Our first playable version looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-debug.gif" alt="Yalta debug mode"></p>

<p>With the three boards representing the three sides of the board as explained above.</p>

<p>This first version allowed us to check that our engine worked as intended, but
required us to refresh a page to see the other players’ moves and wasn’t very user friendly.</p>

<p>That’s when we really became aware that the website part of the project would require
an amount of work strongly higher than the game engine implementation.</p>

<h2 id="a-basic-project">A basic project</h2>

<p>The more we implemented new features on our website, the more features we thought about
which seemed to be required to have a decent user experience on the website. Some of these features
were not necessary but seemed like good ideas/interesting to implement so we implemented some of them
and the others were listed and put aside for later.</p>

<p>After a few weeks, we had a decent result for the play part of the website; three players could
play on the same page, moving by selecting a piece and moving it to its location and seeing the actions’
results in real-time.</p>

<p>Our first <em>matchmaking</em> system was fairly basic, there was a list of created games, and any player
could join any game, if the user was the third player to join a game, it would start, and if there were
3 players already in the game, the user would be considered as a spectator. On top of that, any user
could create a new game.</p>

<p>At this time we had already spent way more time on this project than we thought we were going to,
even though we had only implemented the features we thought were necessary to have a good time
playing the game. The website’s current state was enough to send the link to some friends and play
games with them if we wanted to, the global design of the website wasn’t nice, but playing stayed pretty intuitive.</p>

<p><img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-landing-1.png" alt="Landing page"></p>

<h2 id="not-so-basic-anymore">Not so basic anymore</h2>

<p>When we started this project, we did not define the real scope of users who would use it,
the more we worked on it and the more features we started implementing, the more we started to
want to make it public so that everyone could come and play.</p>

<p>As we started having less free time due to school projects and then the real jobs we got
after graduating, we spent way less time developing this project the following months but we kept working
on it and added a lot of new sfeature. Some of those being necessary for a public release,
some that we felt were a really nice addition for users and some which might just be
really useless (Hello, in-game chat). Among these extra-features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A custom game system to play with friends with custom settings</li>
  <li>A public queue system to play with random unknown players</li>
  <li>A training mode to play against bots in different difficulties</li>
  <li>A profile system with ranks, elo, skins, themes, and statistics</li>
  <li>Game timers</li>
  <li>A board rotation system, to see the board as one of your opponents</li>
  <li>An in-game chat</li>
  <li>The possibility to show replays of games</li>
  <li>A documentation section to explain the website and the game rules</li>
  <li>A landing page to explain to new users what happens here</li>
  <li>A new implementation of the game engine with improved performances
and a graph system (replacing the 3x4x8 sub-boards implementation)</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, a landing page to welcome new players to our website.
The old matchmaking system based on a game list was removed, since the public
queue and private game system fully replaced the need for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-ways-to-play.png" alt="Ways to play"></p>

<h2 id="costs-and-revenues">Costs and revenues</h2>

<p>As we added new features and new services which started to increase potential costs, we had to
consider the <em>business</em> aspect of the website. We were not fully against trying to monetize it but
we did not want this to impact the user experience, driving potential users away because of
<em>aggressive advertising</em> or <em>pay-to-win</em> systems.</p>

<p>We considered <strong>ads</strong>, but generic ads (such as adsense) would require to have a huge 
amount of traffic to really generate money and they usually don’t fit well into a website. We did
not want our website to get significantly less enjoyable for users just to win a few euros every month (or year).</p>

<!--
Another thing we considered was to bring premium content to the website, allowing users to purchase
differents assets such as skin. The issue with this solution is that it is really hard to find good
content which will not impact the other users impact experience.
We did implement a skin system, so that players could update the apparences of their pieces, so that
we could set up a system where the users would be able to buy these apparences. But the impact on the
other players which were just trying to focus would be too high, who wants to start a game and be
matched again a player with flashy purple pieces?
There are options to prevent this scenario such as adding a button to hide every opponents skin, but
players won't buy skins if the other players can't see it.
-->

<p>We considered some other solutions than ads but in the end, <strong>we did not find an adequate business model</strong>.
Not being able to generate revenue is not currently an issue, since the goal never was to quit our jobs and
start working on this project every day of the week. Nevertheless, we did not anticipate when we started this
project (before we decided to add many unexpected features) that there were gonna be real costs to run
the website.</p>

<p>Indeed, the website now runs using many different services and tools which come with a cost, meaning
that we cannot sustain with this business model (which is not one, since we generate no revenue) if
our user count grows too much.</p>

<p>As long as our monthly costs stay under a few dozen of euros, it is
fine, I’d say that we are happy to pay for it if some people are happy to play on
<a href="https://www.yalta-chess.com/">yalta-chess.com</a>. But if this website became too popular, we would have
to scale up the different services we pay for (hosting, Redis, database…), resulting in hundreds of
euros bills.</p>

<p>Hence, if too many people end up enjoying our website, at some point we will have to <strong>shut it
down</strong> (or strongly restrict traffic) if we still cannot generate revenue.</p>

<p>This is really <strong>unlikely</strong> to happen since we don’t plan on doing real advertising for this project,
and we are not so presumptuous as to think that this website is good enough to deserve this much 
success. But we still have to consider this scenario, and if it happens we will still try to consider
ways to generate revenue, we are not fully closed to ads, but we feel like right now nothing …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>To create relevant search, processing clickstream data is key: you frequently want to promote search results that are being clicked on and purchased, and demote those things users don’t love.</p>
<p>Typically search systems think of processing clickstream data as a batch job run over historical data, perhaps using a system like Spark. But on Shopify’s Discovery team, we ask the question: What if we could auto-tune relevance in real-time as users interact with search results—not having to wait days for a large batch job to run?</p>
<p>At Shopify—this is what we’re doing! We’re using streaming data processing systems that can process both real-time and historic data to enable real-time use cases ranging from simple auto boosting or down boosting of documents, to computing aggregate click popularity statistics, building <a href="https://elasticsearch-learning-to-rank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-concepts.html#judgments-expression-of-the-ideal-ordering" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">offline search evaluation sets</a>, and on to more complex reinforcement learning tasks.</p>
<p>But this article is introducing you to the streaming system themselves. In particular, to Apache Beam. And the most important thing to think about is <em>time</em> with those streaming systems. So let’s get started!</p>
<h2>What Exactly is Apache Beam?</h2>
<p><a href="https://beam.apache.org/" target="_blank" title="Apache Beam" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apache Beam</a> is a unified batch and stream processing system. This lets us potentially unify historic and real-time views of user search behaviors in one system. Instead of a batch system, like Spark, to churn over months of old data, and a separate streaming system, like Apache Storm, to process the live user traffic, Beam hopes to keep these workflows together.</p>
<p>For search, this is rather exciting. It means we can build search systems that both rely on historic search logs while perhaps being able to live-tune the system for our users’ needs in various ways.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an early challenge everyone faces with Beam: that of <strong><em>time!</em></strong> Beam is a kind of time machine that has to reorder events in their right spot after getting annoyingly delayed by lots of intermediate processing and storage step. This is one of the core complications of a streaming system - how long do we wait? How do we deal with late or out of order data?</p>
<p>So to get started with Beam, the first thing you’ll need to do is Hack Time!</p>
<h2>The Beam Time Problem</h2>
<p>At the core of Apache Beam are <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-a-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pipelines</a>. They connect a source through various processing steps to finally a sink.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data flowing through a pipeline is timestamped. When you consider a streaming system, this makes sense. We have various delays as events flow from browsers, through APIs, and other data systems. Finally the events arrive at our Beam pipeline. They can easily be out-of-order or delayed. Beam source APIs, like the one for <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.5.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaIO.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kafka</a>, maintain a moving view of the event data to emit well-ordered events known as a <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#watermarks-and-late-data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">watermark</a>.</p>
<p>If we don’t give our Beam source good information on how to build a timestamp, we’ll drop events or receive them in the wrong order. But even more importantly for search, we likely must combine different streams of data to build a single view on a search session or query, like below:</p>
<figure><img alt="combine different streams of data to build a single view on a search session or query, like below" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Beam_for_Search__Getting_started_with_the_Beam_time_machine.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1610128718" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Beam_for_Search__Getting_started_with_the_Beam_time_machine.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1610128718"></figure>
<p>Joining (a Beam topic for another day!) needs to look back over each source’s watermark and ensure they’re aligned in time before deciding that sufficient time has elapsed before moving on. But before you get to the complexities of streaming joins, replaying with accurate timestamps is the first milestone on your Beam-for-clickstream journey.</p>
<h2>Configuring the Timestamp Right at the Source</h2>
<p>Let’s set up a simple Beam pipeline to explore Beam. Here we’ll use Kafka in Java as an example. You can see the full source code <a href="https://gist.github.com/geekigirl/738ead73033ae673483ab9690452f10f" target="_blank" title="Timestamp policy example with Kafka source with Apache BEAM" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">in this gist</a>.</p>
<p>Here we’ll set up a Kafka source, the start of a pipeline producing a custom SearchQueryEvent stored in a search_queries_topic.</p>

<p>You’ll notice we have information on the topic/servers to retrieve the data, along with how to deserialize the underlying binary data. We might add further processing steps to transform or process our SearchQueryEvents, eventually sending the final output to another system.</p>
<p>But nothing about <strong>time</strong> yet. By default, the produced SearchQueryEvents will use Kafka <em>processing</em> time. That is, when they’re read from Kafka. This is the least interesting for our purposes. We care about when users actually searched and clicked on results.</p>
<p>More interesting is when the event was created in a Kafka client. Which we can add here:</p>
<p><code>.withCreateTime(Duration.<em>standardMinutes</em>(5))</code></p>
<p>You’ll notice above, when we use create time below, we need to give the source’s Watermark a tip for how out of order event times might be. For example, below we instruct the Kafka source to use create time, but with a possible 5 minutes of discrepancy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Appreciating The Beam Time Machine</h2>
<p>Let’s reflect on what such a 5 minute possible delay actually means from the last snippet. Beam is kind of a time machine… How Beam bends space-time is where your mind can begin to hurt.</p>
<p>As you might be picking up, <em>event time </em>&nbsp;is quite different from <em>processing time</em>! So in the code snippet above, we’re *not* telling the computer to wait for 5 minutes of execution time for more data. No, the event time might be replayed from historical data, where 5 minutes of event time is replayed through our pipeline in mere milliseconds. Or it could be event time is really now, and we’re actively streaming live data for processing. So we DO indeed wait 5 real minutes!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back and use a silly example to understand this. It’s really crucial to your Beam journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine we’re super-robot androids that can watch a movie at 1000X speed. Maybe like Star Trek The Next Generation’s Lt Commander Data. If you’re unfamiliar, he could process input as fast as a screen could display! Data might say “Hey look, I want to watch the classic 80s movie, The Goonies, so I can be a cultural reference for the crew of the Enterprise.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beam is like watching a movie in super-fast forward mode with chunks of the video appearing possibly delayed or out of order relative to other chunks in movie time. In this context we have two senses of time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Time: the timestamp in the actual 1h 55 minute runtime of The Goonies aka movie time.</li>
<li>Processing Time: the time we actually experience The Goonies (perhaps just a few minutes if we’re super-robot androids like Data).</li>
</ul>
<p>So Data tells the Enterprise computer “Look, play me The Goonies as fast as you can recall it from your memory banks.” And the computer has various hiccups where certain frames of the movie aren’t quite getting to Data’s screen to keep the movie in order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commander Data can tolerate missing these frames. So Data says “Look, don’t wait more than 5 minutes in *movie time* (aka event time) before just showing me what you have so far of that part of the movie. This lets Data watch the full movie in a short amount of time, dropping a tolerable number of movie frames.</p>
<p>This is just what Beam is doing with our search query data. Sometimes it’s replaying days worth of historic search data in milliseconds, and other times we’re streaming live data where we truly must wait 5 minutes for reality to be processed. Of course, the right delay might not be 5 minutes, it might be something else appropriate to our needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beam has other primitives such as <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/windowing/Window.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">windows</a> which further inform, beyond the source, how data should be buffered or collected in units of time. Should we collect our search data in daily windows? Should we tolerate late data? What does subsequent processing expect to work over? Windows also work with the same time machine concepts that must be appreciated deeply to work with Beam.</p>
<h2>Incorporating A Timestamp Policy</h2>
<p>Beam might know a little about Kafka, but it really doesn’t know anything about <strong>our</strong> data model. Sometimes we need even more control over the definition of time in the Beam time machine.</p>
<p>For example, in our previous movie example, movie frames perhaps have some field informing us of how they should be arranged in movie time. If we examine our SearchQueryEvent, we also see a specific timestamp embedded in the data itself:</p>
<p><code>public class SearchQueryEvent {</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public final String queryString;</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public final Instant searchTimestamp;</code></p>
<p><code>…</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>Well Beam sources can often be configured to use a custom event time like our searchTimestamp. We just need to make a TimestampPolicy. We simply provide a simple function-class that takes in our record (A key-value of Long-&gt;SearchQueryEvent) and returns a timestamp:</p>

<p>We can use this to create our own timestamp policy:</p>

<p>Here, we’ve passed in our own function, and we’ve given the same allowed delay (5 minutes). This is all wrapped up in a factory class TimestampPolicyFactory SearchQueryTimestampPolicyFactory (now if that doesn’t sound like a Java class name, I don’t know what does ;) )</p>
<p>We can add our timestamp policy to the builder:</p>
<p><code>.withTimestampPolicyFactory(new SearchQueryTimestampPolicyFactory())</code></p>

				<p>Yeti will not use any of Facebook's products from today onwards.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Facebook controls some of the most used apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and of course, Facebook. They have shown time over time that they don't care about their users' privacy and are willing to do anything to maximize their stronghold and power.</p><p>It's clear that consumers and society always lose when one company becomes too big. That's why there are monopoly and anti-trust laws that try to prevent and regulate such cases.</p><p>Tech companies such as Facebook and Google have new business models and therefore have managed to evade those laws. Luckily, this is changing, as governments are introducing more laws that aim at breaking up and regulating these companies to protect consumers.</p><p>But we can't only rely on our governments to take action. Every single consumer's decisions also matter. If enough people stop using Facebook's products, their power will diminish.</p><p>This is easier said than done, because these products have network effects. That means that the value of the product to the user increases exponentially for every additional user. For example, you wouldn't use WhatsApp if none of your friends were on it. At the same time, it's much harder for you to switch to a different messaging app like Signal because you need to convince all your friends to join, too.</p><p>It's hard but not impossible.</p><p>From today onwards, we pledge that Yeti will not use any products by Facebook. As stated in <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/become-a-facebook-free-business/">Basecamp's blog post</a>, which inspired our decision, this means:</p><ol><li>We do not buy advertisement on Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp.</li><li>We do not use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp to promote or represent our business or to communicate with our customers.</li><li>We do not assist Facebook in its data collection regime through use of Facebook social Like buttons or by offering Facebook logins.</li></ol><p>This was not an easy decision. For example, Instagram and Facebook are important platform for us to stay in touch with current and prospective consumers. It's clear that by taking this decision, we will lose customers and money. However, it is the right thing to do and this is something that's more important than financial success.</p><p>As a customer, you can be assured that none of the money you spend with us goes to Facebook.</p><p>Now, go and <a href="https://yeticheese.com/product/yeti-no-1">buy our cheese</a> so we can make up for the lost revenue 😝</p>

<p>This is the fourth part of a four part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/11/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-ii-subsistence-on-the-hoof/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/18/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-iii-horse-fiddles/">III</a>) look at the Dothraki from George R. R. Martin’s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em>.  We’re looking at, in particular, if Martin’s claim that the Dothraki are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” can be sustained in the face of even basic knowledge about historical Steppe and Great Plains nomadic peoples.</p>



<p>Last week, we <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/18/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-iii-horse-fiddles/">concluded </a>that the vast majority of Dothraki culture, social organization, economic practices and family structure are effectively completely untethered from the historical realities of effectively any of the literally dozens of historical Great Plains Native Americans or Steppe nomads.  This week, we’re going to close out our look by discussing Dothraki warfare.  We’ll start with the visual – weapons and armor – and then move to the conceptual – strategy, operations and tactics.</p>

And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>Finally, as a reminder both of what we are investigating, <strong>the key statement we are really assessing here is <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">this one by George R.R. Martin</a>:</strong></p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes… seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.</p></blockquote>



<p>It is not the <em>existence</em> of a fantasy culture which draws our attention, but the explicit declaration that this fantasy culture is not merely inspired, but ‘fashioned as an amalgam’ of real cultures, which both existed in the past <em>and still exist today</em>, with only ‘a dash of pure fantasy.’  That line is important, to be clear, <strong>because it presents the fictional Dothraki as a statement on historical Native American and Eurasian nomads</strong> and – when combined with Martin’s statements that he relies on history to inform his work – that this statement is based in some sort of historical reality.</p>



<p>Which it isn’t.  But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.</p>



<h2>Where There’s a Whip…</h2>



<p>The Dothraki are described as having three main weapons: <strong>bows </strong>(<em>AGoT</em>, 86, 555, 558, 597, 669), <strong>whips </strong>(<em>AGoT</em>, 86, 194, 493, 555, 596, 669) and a <strong>curved sword called an <em>arakh</em></strong> (<em>AGoT</em> 85, 86, 327, 493, 555, 556, 559, 560, 596, 597, 669, 674); <strong>of these, the <em>arakh</em> is clearly the most prominent</strong> (I am sure I have missed a reference to a weapon here or there, but I hope the citations here give some sense of the relative weight each is given – the <em>arakh</em> is the most frequently mentioned by some distance).  When a Dothraki warrior enters <em>Vaes Dothrak</em>, each, “unbelted his <em>arakh</em> and handed it to a waiting slave, and any other weapons he carried as well” – after the <em>arakh</em>, the other weapons are seemingly afterthoughts (<em>AGoT</em>, 327).  The prominence of the <em>arakh</em> in the narrative is underscored by the fact that it is the only one of these weapons whose name we learn in Dothraki, or which is described in terms of its shape or special function (<em>AGoT</em>, 85), while the bows and whips remain just bows and whips (ironic, as it was Steppe <em>bows</em>, not Steppe swords, which were unusual).</p>



<p>We might dismiss this as simply an accident of Daenerys’ perspective – that, being Westerosi, she focuses on the weapon most meaningful to the Westerosi – but that’s clearly not true.  After all, the <strong>offering of an <em>arakh</em> is how Daenerys’ loyal followers demonstrate their fealty to her</strong>, in a ceremony that is clearly Dothraki, not Westerosi (<em>AGoT</em>, 674).  It is also, I should note,<a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arakh"> the only weapon we see <em>non</em>-Dothraki using that is clearly identified as being foreign and typical of the Dothraki</a>.  It remains special through the eyes of multiple point-of-view characters, including military men.</p>



<p>(And, as an aside, now that we are this far in, it seems obvious but worth saying that the fact that Martin has no Dothraki viewpoint characters in his narrative is hardly a saving grace; it merely intensifies the ‘view of a savage culture from outside’ effect.  As we’ll see, this makes perfect sense given what seem to be the actual inspirations for his depiction.)</p>



<p><strong>The prominence of a curved iron (or steel) sword lets us rule out a Great Plains Native American inspiration for this kit right out</strong>; the sword was never a significant part of Plains Native American armament (the lack of tool-metal production in the Americas prior to European contact means that there was no indigenous sword-making tradition, although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macuahuitl"><em>maquahuitl</em> </a>represents a clever sort of ‘sharpened club’ design).  Even after contact, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the expense of trading for a sword wouldn’t have been justified by its utility over a steel axe which might also double as a tool (on axes, see W. Lee, “The Military Revolution of Native North America: Firearms, Forts and Politics” in <em>Empires and Indigenes</em> (2011), 62-3).  <strong>So we must turn to the Eurasian Steppe</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>And immediately we run into problems</strong>, not that any of these weapons are <em>wrong</em> per se, but <strong>that their proportion and prominence is all mixed up and that there are other, far more important weapons missing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>For a Steppe nomad, by far, above and away, the most important weapon was the bow.</strong>  The Armenians literally called the Mongols “the nation of archers” (May, <em>Mongol Art of War</em>, 43).  Nomads spent the most time learning the bow (May, <em>op. cit.</em> 42-49) and it was the one indispensable weapon.  Indeed, so indispensable that nomads were generally required to have several; the <em>Liao Shi</em> records that Khitan nomad warriors were required to possess four bows and 400 arrows, while John de Plano Carpini reports that the Mongols all needed to have 2-3 bows and three larger quivers (May, <em>op. cit. </em>49-50).  <strong>The Steppe bow itself would also have looked unusual in both shape and construction</strong> to a Westerosi observer either strung or unstrung – they were composite bows, made with a wood core, a backing of horn and a rigid end-piece (called a <em>siyah</em> in Arabic) and were generally drawn with the use of a thumb-ring to reduce strain on the thumb (May, <em>op. cit.</em>, 50-1).  This unique construction allowed these bows to reach draw weights and launch energies equivalent to the far larger yew longbows of England and Wales and still be compact enough to use from horseback.</p>

<p>(I should note that the bow was <em>also</em> the paramount weapon for the Native American horse-borne nomads of the Great Plains, at least until it came into competition with firearms, though my understanding is that Native American bows were not as powerful as Steppe bows).</p>

You can see here the unique shape and multi-part construction of the Steppe bow (notice how the material on the tips, the belly and the spine of the bow are all different) which allows it so much power in such a small frame.<br>Also, notice the very nice and colorful traditional Mongolian clothing – not leather and rough furs!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>But even after the bow, the sword is not first.  Or even close to first.</strong>  Or, indeed, <em>even on the list</em>!  The Khitan regulations I mentioned included four bows, two spears (one ‘long’ and one ‘short’), a club, an axe and a halberd, but no sword.  John de Plano Carpini describes the full kit as two or three bows with quivers, an axe, ropes, and swords <em>only for the wealthy</em> (May. <em>op. cit.</em>, 50).  Speaking more broadly, May notes that spears (used as lances from horseback) seem universal in accounts of the Mongols, but “accounts are contradictory regarding whether these [swords] were universally used” (May, <em>op. cit.</em>, 52).  While May supposes that the <em>ughurgh-a</em>, the Mongolian lasso, might have been used in combat – and it may well have – we have no definitive evidence of it.  If it was ever a weapon, it doesn’t seem to have been an important one.</p>



<p><strong>In short, while the Dothraki’s weapons are an <em>arakh</em>-sword, a whip, and a bow in that order, the Mongol’s chief weapons were his bow, followed by his backup bow, followed by his <em>other </em>backup bow, followed by his spear, and then his axe and only then followed by a sword, should he have one, which he might well not</strong>.  The reason for preferring an axe or a spear for the humble nomad should not be too surprising – iron in quantity could be hard to get on the Steppe.  Spears and axes are not only weapons, but also useful hunting and survival tools; swords are generally weapons only.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">Nomads generally cannot do their own metal working</a>, so swords would have to be imported.  Moreover, even in a melee, the first recourse would be to a spear, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/08/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-ii-total-warg/">whose reach on horseback was a huge advantage</a>,<strong> making a sword an expensive imported foreign luxury <em>backup</em> weapon with no additional utility</strong>.  Nevertheless, it’s clear that Steppe nomads, once successful and moving into agrarian areas, liked to acquire swords – swords are effective weapons! – but the sword was about the furthest thing from the core of Mongol culture the way the <em>arakh</em> is practically the <em>symbol</em> of Dothraki culture.</p>

<p><strong>The other issue, of course, is the <em>arakh</em> itself.</strong>  Martin describes the weapons as “long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe” (<em>AGoT</em>, 85) and goes back to that scythe analogy (e.g. <em>ASoS</em>, 245).  It seems generally asserted that what Martin means by this is something close to a scimitar (I have to confess, I haven’t found anywhere that Martin says …</p></div></div>

Given its safety, </span><span>w</span><span>e call for immediate widespread increased vitamin D intakes</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D modulates thousands of genes and many aspects of immune function, both innate and adaptive. The scientific evidence</span><span>1</span><span>&nbsp;shows that:</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D is well known to be essential, but most people do not get enough. Two common definitions of inadequacy are deficiency &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L), the target of most governmental organizations, and insufficiency &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L), the target of several medical societies &amp; experts.</span><span>2</span><span>&nbsp;Too many people have levels below these targets. </span><span>Rates of vitamin D deficiency &lt;20ng/ml exceed 33% of the population in most of the world, and most estimates of insufficiency &lt;30ng/ml are well over 50% (but much higher in many countries).</span><span>3</span><span>&nbsp;Rates are even higher in winter, and several groups have notably worse deficiency: the overweight, those with dark skin (especially far from the equator), and care home residents. These same groups face increased COVID-19 risk.</span></p><p><span>It has been shown that 3875 IU (97mcg) daily is required for 97.5% of people to reach 20ng/ml, and 6200 IU (155mcg) for 30ng/ml,</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;intakes far above all national guidelines. Unfortunately, the report that set the US RDA included an admitted statistical error in which required intake was calculated to be ~10x too low.</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;Numerous calls in the academic literature to raise official recommended intakes had not yet resulted in increases by the time SARS-CoV-2 arrived. Now, many papers indicate that vitamin D affects COVID-19 more strongly than most other health conditions, with increased risk at levels &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L) and severely greater risk &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L).</span><span>1</span></p><p><span>Evidence to date </span><span>suggests </span><span>the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic sustains itself in large part &nbsp;through infection of those with low vitamin D, and that deaths are concentrated largely in those with deficiency. The mere possibility that this is so should compel urgent gathering of more vitamin D data. </span><span>Even without more data</span><span>, </span><span>the </span><span>preponderance </span><span>of evidence indicates that </span><span>increased vitamin D would help reduce infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, &amp; deaths</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Decades of safety data show that vitamin D has very low risk: </span><span>Toxicity would be extremely rare with the recommendations here. The risk of insufficient levels far outweighs any risk from levels that seem to provide most of the protection against COVID-19, and this is notably different from drugs. Vitamin D is much safer than steroids, such as dexamethasone, the most widely accepted treatment to have also demonstrated a large COVID-19 benefit. Vitamin D’s safety is more like that of face masks. </span><span>There is no need to wait for further clinical trials to increase use of something so safe, </span><span>especially when remedying high rates of deficiency/insufficiency should already be a priority</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, we call on all governments, doctors, and healthcare workers worldwide to immediately recommend and implement efforts appropriate to their adult populations to increase vitamin D, at least until the end of the pandemic. Specifically to:</span></p><p><span>Many factors are known to predispose individuals to higher risk from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as age, being male, comorbidities, etc., but </span><span>inadequate</span><span>&nbsp;v</span><span>itamin D is by far the most easily and quickly </span><span>modifiable</span><span>&nbsp;risk factor with abundant evidence to support a large effect</span><span>. Vitamin D is inexpensive and has negligible risk compared to the considerable risk of COVID-19.</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>&nbsp;The following include 4000 IU within their tolerable intakes in official guidelines: NAM (US, Canada), SACN (UK), EFSA (Europe), Endocrine Society (international), Nordic countries, The Netherlands, Australia &amp; New Zealand, UAE, and the American Geriatrics Soc. (USA, elderly). No major agency specifies a lower tolerable intake limit. The US NAM said 4000 IU “is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals.” See also [</span><span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32180081/">Giustina et al ‘20</a></span><span>].</span></p><p><span>The signatories below endorse this letter.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div role="main"><div><article><p>Modern processors are quite complex, with many parts having the potential to become a bottleneck. It is relatively easy to reason about the performance of short pieces of code, especially if memory effects are kept to a minimum. Both static analysis tools like LLVM MCA and microbenchmarks can provide a lot of information in such cases. However, the behaviour of the whole program is not just the sum of those small parts. As the code becomes larger and more complex other effects start appearing. One of such potential problems are excessive instruction cache misses.</p><p>Every program has different properties, and those large-scale effects will affect it differently. However, if its job is to execute complex logic on a small amount of data, the instruction cache is likely to become a problem at some point. The actual impact may vary significantly from codebase to codebase, which is why I won’t show any numbers in this article. Let’s consider this just a collection of ideas, but it is not easy to tell how much any of them will help for a given application.</p><p>First, let’s have a quick look at the processor front end. Below is a simplified diagram of how it is arranged in Skylake, the numbers between units are the maxima per cycle.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="630" height="860" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-front-end.min.2e73578fff.svg" alt="CPU front end"></p><p>Each cycle the processor fetches up to 16 bytes from the instruction cache using information from the Branch Prediction Unit to predict the control flow. The pre-decode unit determines instruction lengths and puts up to five of them in the Instruction Queue. From the Instruction Queue, up to 5 instructions (with macro-fusion) are brought each cycle to the decoders. There is one complex decoder that can handle instructions that translate to up to 4 µops and 3 simple decoders that can handle only single-µop instructions. In total, all decoders are limited to producing no more than 5 µops each cycle. Instructions that require more than 4 µops go through Microcode Sequence ROM, which emits 4 µops per cycle, and while it is active, the decoders are disabled. There is also Decoded ICache (<abbr title="Decoded Stream Buffer">DSB</abbr>) which caches decoded µops. It can emit up to 6 µops each cycle. All µops, regardless of their source, end up in the Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ). The Loop Stream Detector (LSD) detects small loops and keeps them in the queue, so that no fetched, decodes or reads from the DSB are needed during the duration of the loop. IDQ is the last part of the front end, and the queued µops continue to the back end.</p><p>From the instruction cache point of view, the front end has two weaknesses. Firstly, instructions are processed in-order which can severely limit the processor ability to hide latencies of cache misses. HyperThreading can make sure that this part of the processor still does some useful work, but it is also the source of the second problem – all resources, including the L1 instruction cache and µop cache are shared between the hardware threads.</p><p>Modern processors provide various metrics that help monitor their behaviour. However, the task of extracting the relevant data requires a proper approach if it is to be done efficiently. Top-down analysis is invaluable with helping to understand microarchitectural phenomena in large codebases. The idea is to monitor program behaviour with the <abbr title="Performance Monitoring Unit">PMU</abbr> counters and identify the bottleneck starting with the major functional parts of the CPU and then digging deeper narrowing down on the exact source of the problem. It can be done in an automated way by tools like VTune or toplev.</p><pre><code>FE    Frontend_Bound:                                      39.48 +-  0.00 % Slots

    Pipeline)...
</code></pre><p>Above is an example of a toplev result. We can see that the instruction cache misses were the dominating bottleneck. Unsurprisingly instruction TLB misses also show up. On the front end bandwidth side of things, toplev points to the legacy decode pipeline. That makes perfect sense if the instructions are supplied from DSB or LSD, then there are no instruction fetches, and no cache misses.</p><p>Sometimes, the final summary may not provide sufficient information if there are changes in the code behaviour during the test. When that’s the case, a graph is likely to be a much more helpful way of presenting the results.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="950" height="950" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-toplev.min.2b465fdb6f.svg" alt="toplev"></p><p>Tools like toplev are great for initial identification of the problem, but once that’s done what we need is a right way for comparing different solutions. Ultimately, the most important metric is the actual performance of the program in a real-life workload. toplev still can be helpful as it shows the balance between different performance-limiting factors. What also can be useful is <code>perf stat</code> which can show the performance counter statistics. The event most relevant for us is <code>L1-icache-load-misses</code>, though there are more model-specific registers that may be of interest.</p><p>Now, that we know how to diagnose excessive instruction cache misses, let’s see what can be done to deal with this problem.</p><h2 id="avoiding-work">Avoiding work</h2><p>If the number of executed instructions is the problem, the most obvious solution is to try to reduce that number. Obviously, that’s much easier said than done, but there are some common patterns for dealing with this issue. One example would be prepared statements in databases. The general idea is that if a client knows it will send requests that have some commonality, it can tell the database engine early that the requests are going to match specific templates. This information allows the server to do as much work as possible during the preparation stage, thus reducing the amount of logic that needs to be executed for each individual request.</p><p>Extracting common patterns doesn’t have to be explicit. A server or any other kind of an application which actions depend on the user input could attempt to look for repeating patterns and cache some common parts. This is a very vague idea and most likely won’t be easily implementable in a lot of applications, but in some cases may be quite a natural solution. It also shows the main problem with the “just do less” approach – it is very application specific. On the plus, side, if this can be done, it is likely to help with the overall performance, not just the instruction cache misses.</p><p>Another potential problem is making sure that the preparation phase can really do something to help during the execution phase. If that means pre-computing some values, then it’s simple. However, if the only thing that preparation gives us is the knowledge which code paths are going to be exercised and which branches taken during the execution, it is going to be harder to take benefit from it. One option is to have some specialised code for the most common paths, C++ templates may come in handy here. If it is not easy to determine what may be the most common paths, then a just-in-time compiler may be used to generate code in the preparation stage.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><h2 id="batching-work">Batching work</h2><p>So far, we have been trying to reduce the number of executed instructions, by taking advantage of some earlier knowledge to avoiding repeating the same work. In other words, we have introduced two stages:</p><ul><li>preparation, which is performed rarely and, consequently, less performance critical</li><li>execution, which is done many times and is expected to dominate overall performance</li></ul><p>The way this can help with the instruction cache misses is that the execution stage, being smaller, is more likely to fit in the instruction cache. Whether this brings any measurable benefits depends highly on the type of the application and how much logic can be moved from execution to preparation stages.</p><p>We have already split our processing pipeline into preparation and execution stage. If the execution stage can fit in the instruction cache, we are done. However, often, that’s not the case. What we can do to improve the situation more is to split the execution into more stages. This time the goal is not to reuse work as it was with the preparation, but to group entities that need to have the same code executed for them. In other words, if the processing pipeline consists of steps A, B and C the idea is to separate them, add a queue in front of each of those stages, and then cycle through those stages each time handling multiple elements from the queue. Connections between the stages don’t have to be one-to-one, any directed graph is fine.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="756" height="331" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-seda.min.7259b25adc.svg" alt="SEDA diagram"></p><p>In the diagram above, there is one stage that feeds tasks to one of two stages. This could be, for example, a front-end of a database server. The first stage does some initial request processing and then, depending on whether it is a read or write, puts it in the appropriate queue. Each stage processes requests in batches, the first one warms up the instruction …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

It's like the distance a speeding car travels after the brakes are applied.</p>  <p>But Monday's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00955-x">study in the journal Nature Climate Change</a> calculates that a bit differently and now figures the carbon pollution already put in the air will push global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times.</p>  <p>Previous estimates, including those accepted by international science panels, were about a degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) less than that amount of committed warming.</p>  <p>International climate agreements set goals of limiting warming to 2 C&nbsp;(3.6 F) since pre-industrial times, with the more ambitious goal of limiting it to 1.5 C&nbsp;(2.7 F) added in Paris in 2015. The world has already warmed about 1.1 C&nbsp;(2 F).</p>  <p>"You've got some ... global warming inertia that's going to cause the climate system to keep warming, and that's essentially what we're calculating," said study co-author Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. "Think about the climate system like the Titanic. It's hard to turn the ship when you see the icebergs."</p>  <p>Dessler and colleagues at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Nanjing University in China calculated committed warming to take into account that the world has warmed at different rates in different places and that places that haven't warmed as fast are destined to catch up.</p>    <p>Places such as the Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica are a bit cooler, and that difference creates low-lying clouds that reflect more sun away from earth, keeping these places cooler. But this situation can't keep going indefinitely because physics dictates that cooler locations will warm up more and when they do, the clouds will dwindle and more heating will occur, Dessler said.</p>  <p>Previous studies were based on the cooler spots staying that way, but Dessler and colleagues say that's not likely.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/greenland-record-melt.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/greenland-record-melt.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/greenland-record-melt.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/greenland-record-melt.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>In this Aug. 16, 2019 file photo, icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland.

Breakthrough Institute climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the new work fits better with climate models than observational data.</p>  <p>Just because the world is bound to get more warming than international goals, that doesn't mean all is lost in the fight against global warming, said Dessler, who cautioned against what he called "climate doomers."</p>  <p>If the world gets to net zero carbon emissions soon, 2 degrees of global warming could be delayed enough so that it won't happen for centuries, giving society time to adapt or even come up with technological fixes, he said.</p>  <p>"If we don't, we're going to blow through (climate goals) in a few decades," Dessler said. "It's really the rate of warming that makes climate change so terrible. If we got a few degrees over 100,000 years, that would not be that big a deal. We can deal with that. But a few degrees over 100 years is really bad."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>
