                <div>
                    <p>One of the issues I discovered while playing with microk8s Kubernetes setup locally was that many services and tools like <code>Kubernetes Dashboard</code> uses HTTPS for access and I don't want to use Self-Signed SSL certificates as it would require me installing these certificates in every device I use which would be a pain in the butt. So I was on the journey finding a way to have an SSL Certificate for my internal IP addresses. This article will document my journey of getting automatic SSL certificates for my internal microk8s Kubernetes setup.</p><h2 id="ssl-certificate-for-internal-ip-address">SSL Certificate for internal IP address?</h2><p>My first question was is there a way to get an SSL certificate from Public trusted Certificate Authority after looking at many free services like Let's Encrypt and similar services don't provide certificates to IP addresses, but only to domain names.</p><p>After discovering the issue with no way to get an SSL certificate for internal IP I was looking into other options for my problem. After racking my brains for a few minutes I had a question: Could I create a DNS A record for internal IP and would it work? A quick visit to my DNS control panel adding A record to the local IP address and visiting the domain name and seeing my local IP address served website I was amazed that it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Discovering that I can have a domain name for internal IP working I was surprised now I had curiosity if I will be able to use service like Let's Encrypt to generate an SSL Certificate for this domain name but if I remember correctly the Let's Encrypt requires external access to verify domain name ownership. Hmm, maybe there is a way to verify domain name ownership without external access? After some digging around Let's Encrypt documentation, I found that there many ways to verify domain ownership one of them is DNS plugins which have many DNS providers to automatically verify domains by modifying DNS records using API from those providers. In my case it is DigitalOcean.</p><p>Following <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> <a href="https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>I tried to generate a certificate for internal IP but I ran into the issue that default macOS <code>certbot</code> installation from <code>brew install certbot</code> had no <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin available.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>After a quick search online I found that DNS Plugins are not installed by default with <code>certbot</code>. I needed to install <code>certbox-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin using PIP</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Afterward, I was able to generate a certificate without many issues:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Applying SSL certificate to local HTTPS server I was able to get HTTPS valid response from the internal IP address using a domain name</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Now that I know that I can generate &amp; use an SSL certificate for internal IP address just by using a domain name. Now I can try to migrate this knowledge to integrate this to microk8s local setup.</p><h2 id="integrating-let-s-encrypt-with-dns-challenge-into-microk8s-setup-using-cert-manager">Integrating Let's Encrypt with DNS challenge into microk8s setup using <code>cert-manager</code></h2><p>I am not going to describe microk8s Kubernetes setup as it is pretty straightforward compared to the plain Kubernetes setup.</p><p>The first step is to install <code>cert-manager</code> I will be using Helm to install it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now let's configure Certificate Issuer. I will be using the configuration for DigitalOcean but it should be pretty easy to follow instructions from <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/">documentation</a>.</p><p>First, we need DigitalOcean API token Base64 encoded to be saved in secrets</p><p>You can encode token to base64 using <code>echo -n "Token" | base64</code></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now we need to configure Certificate Issuer. (I had to change kind from <code>Issuer</code> to <code>ClusterIssuer</code> because of namespace issues)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that we configured everything we should use the SSL certificate somewhere for this article I will configure microk8s ingress to allow access to <code>kubernetes-dashboard</code> via <code>https://server.techprowd.com/dashboard</code></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now after applying the resources we can check if our certificate resource was created and check if our Let's Encrypt Certificate was created too</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that everything created we should be able to access <code>https://server.techprowd.com/dashboard</code></p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-6.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-6.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-6.png 1135w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If I understood correctly the Certificate will be automatically renewed when expiration time comes up.</p><p>So that's all for this article. I hope this helped other people who had similar ideas like me when started working with Kubernetes.</p><p>P.S. I am not a professional Kubernetes engineer and everything mentioned in this article is just my assumptions and trying out practices in the local environment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>â€˜Just a second. I just need to respond to this one thing,â€™ I said to my daughter, as I attended to my iPhone.</p>
<p>Only much later could I count the mistakes in that statement. No, it wouldnâ€™t take â€˜just a secondâ€™; no, I didnâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to respond to the email â€“ Iâ€™m an author and researcher, and thus rarely receive messages that have a drop-everything-and-answer urgency to them. And no, it wouldnâ€™t be â€˜one thingâ€™. My brain would be too tempted, Iâ€™d feast on it all.</p>
<p>After I finished, I looked up and my daughter was gone. The worst part: before I became distracted, we had been playing a lovely game, telling each other what superpower we most wished for. It could have brought us closer together, but Iâ€™d just blown the spirit and substance of it big-time.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re a parent in the 21st century, I bet youâ€™ve experienced your own version of this. But itâ€™s not just parents, itâ€™s all of us in our interactions with each other. Distraction has become the norm. Weâ€™re blessed with pocket-sized supercomputers that connect us to anyone and everyone, and a buffet of information. But thereâ€™s a dark side: those same gadgets distract us, often at the moments that matter most.</p>
<p>Of course, smartphones didnâ€™t invent distraction â€“ theyâ€™re just the latest culprit. Before that, we blamed television. And before that, it was the telephone, or comic books, or the radio. Go back more than 2,000 years, and Socrates was even criticising the written word, for causing â€˜forgetfulness in the learnersâ€™ soulsâ€™.</p>
<p>Still, our present feels different, with the sources of distraction seeming greater in number and more ubiquitous. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013916514539755">study</a> in 2014 showed that when two people are talking, the mere presence of a smartphone resting on a table is enough to change the character of their conversation. Thatâ€™s a tame example. To see the seriousness of the problem, look at the sobering <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving">statistics</a> on â€˜distracted drivingâ€™ in the United States.</p>
<p>After I abandoned my daughter and our game for an utterly inconsequential email, I realised I needed to deal with my distraction problem. First, I tried a popular approach: I blamed technology and made a serious attempt at a â€˜digital detoxâ€™. I bought a flip phone, subscribed to a print newspaper, and even purchased a 1990s-era word processor without an internet connection. I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, Iâ€™d become the disciplined writer and focused father Iâ€™d always strived to be.</p>
<p>Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. â€˜Hmmm,â€™ I said to myself, â€˜I really should take a glance at this bookâ€™. Iâ€™d justify the distraction as necessary for â€˜researchâ€™. And if it wasnâ€™t reading, then Iâ€™d find something else â€“ the laundry that <em>needed</em> to be folded right now, my desk that <em>needed</em> to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasnâ€™t distracting me. <em>I</em> was distracting me.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s when I started a five-year journey to understand <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/distractions/">distraction</a>, its causes and its cures. I discovered a great deal that I found surprising and counterintuitive, and I developed methods to deal with my distraction that actually worked â€“ and didnâ€™t involve me trying to turn back time and operate a flip phone. I realised that distraction often begins from within, not without, and found that the fix came from identifying and managing the psychological discomfort that leads us off track.</p>
<p>As often as not, distraction is your brain ducking challenging feelings such as boredom, loneliness, insecurity, fatigue and uncertainty. These are the internal triggers â€“ the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/kids-video-game-obsession/">root causes</a> â€“ that prompt you to find the comfort of distraction and open a browser tab, Twitter or email, instead of focusing on the matter at hand. Once you identify these internal triggers, you can decide to respond in a more advantageous manner. You wonâ€™t always be able to control how you feel â€“ but you can learn to control how you react to the way you feel. A trigger that once sent you to Twitter can perhaps lead instead to 10 deep breaths.</p>
<p>Distraction, in other words, is a symptom of a problem â€“ not the problem itself. Those deeper and systemic reasons â€“ such as an inability to cope with fear, anxiety or stress â€“ deserve our concern, because itâ€™s only when we start to address them that we can make real progress. When we begin to understand what weâ€™re trying to avoid by clicking over to Twitter or checking the news for the 10th time today, we can begin to address the issue itself, and not medicate it through more distraction. We also begin to appreciate how habitual the act of avoiding discomfort via distraction can be, and how much itâ€™s become a part of how we work and live.</p>
<p>The good news is that thereâ€™s something paradoxical about discomfort: itâ€™s actually the best tool we have for evolving and developing as a species. Feeling bad isnâ€™t actually bad; itâ€™s what helped us survive. Writing in 2001, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-70020-001">observed</a>: â€˜If satisfaction and pleasure were permanent, there might be little incentive to continue seeking further benefits or advances.â€™ If we didnâ€™t feel bad, in other words, weâ€™d never achieve good.</p>
<p>Once you understand the depth of distraction, you can start to manage it and improve. After years of experiments, I found myself less distracted â€“ a quality that improved nearly every aspect of my life. It turns out that being able to focus on the subjects and people in my life who matter improved everything from my health to my happiness to my productivity. That can seem obvious, but I couldnâ€™t have fully appreciated the joys of living an indistractable life if I hadnâ€™t gotten there on my own after a five-year journey. Being indistractable can lead you to not just change your life for the better, but also experience life fully.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Self-explore</strong></p>
<p>Identifying the triggers that made you feel bad in the first place requires self-exploration. When you notice yourself feeling distracted, pause and ask yourself what youâ€™re feeling. Are you worried? Are you afraid? Then go one step deeper. What caused the sensation? How does it feel in your body?</p>
<p>In exploring my own internal triggers, I began to appreciate that my anxiety about a project, which might lead me to find a tempting Wikipedia rabbit hole, was actually adaptive: the fact that I was anxious was good because it meant I was trying to become better. It was sometimes even as easy as saying to myself: â€˜Youâ€™re getting distracted right now because youâ€™re worried this wonâ€™t be up to snuff. Thatâ€™s okay. It means youâ€™re trying to do your best work, and thatâ€™s something to feel good about.â€™ It seems like a simple mental trick, but even that thought can have a profound influence in keeping you on track.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s an interesting paradox about internal triggers: they can be big, imposing, powerful issues, and yet the fixes can sometimes be easy and quick. Hereâ€™s an example: letâ€™s say that an internal trigger when youâ€™re about to get started on a looming project is boredom. You just canâ€™t bring yourself to get excited about doing your taxes. And because you get bored, you get distracted. But if you know youâ€™re going to get bored, you can find ways to avoid the distraction that will soothe the boredom. For instance, if you set a time limit to work on the otherwise mind-numbing task that is so short, you wonâ€™t have a chance to get bored. Anyone can work on their taxes for just 10 minutes. This is called the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/strange-sex-habits-of-silicon-valley/">10-minute rule</a>, and itâ€™s an effective way to avoid distractions of all sorts. The point is to anticipate the internal trigger and then intercept it with a new routine rather than allowing yourself to slink away into doing something you didnâ€™t intend to do.</p>
<p>In the case of my interaction with my daughter, the internal trigger might have been anxiety about work or <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (on an email). But I can address both of those proactively, so that they donâ€™t interfere with precious daddy-daughter time. In the case of my work anxiety, I could make sure that someone on my team is monitoring incoming messages. I could put up an â€˜out of officeâ€™ email that encourages people to call me if thereâ€™s really an emergency. Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something, but thatâ€™s all right too. Any one of those is a better and more constructive response to the internal trigger than being distracted.</p>
<p>Whatever approach you take to address your inner triggers, itâ€™s encouraging to note that merely recognising uncomfortable feelings and identifying them could be beneficial. For instance, in a smoking-cessation <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871611002535?via%3Dihub">study</a>, researchers found that participants who learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit smoking at double the rates of those in the American Lung Associationâ€™s best-performing cessation programme. Just identifying and investigating a craving had a tremendous impact.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve identified the triggers, you can reframe the task at hand. Sure, you might be â€˜forced to do your taxesâ€™. But another way of thinking about that is that you â€˜get to review last yearâ€™s business successesâ€™. It sounds laughable, but it works. When I hit rough patches mid-book writing, I would say: â€˜I get to share this with my audience,â€™ as opposed to: â€˜I really have to work on the book today.â€™</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s one strategy: I found the fun in whatever I was doing. Yes, I know, this is where you roll your eyes, but hear me out. I learned to stay focused on the tedious work of writing books by looking for and finding the mystery embedded in my work. I wasnâ€™t â€˜writingâ€™, I was â€˜exploringâ€™. I wasnâ€™t Ernest Hemingway; I was Scooby-Doo. Research indicates that even the simple act of thinking of something that you donâ€™t enjoy as …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like my two big hi-res monitors. I love my keyboard and my mouse. And I connect them to my stationary
“main” PC and to several other Windows and Mac laptops, alternatively. I’d like to easily switch where these peripheral
devices are connected to, and that’s the traditional role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, KVM switches that support 4K/60hz resolutions cost hundreds of dollars, there are
no KVM switches that support USB-C, and I couldn’t find KVM switches that support multiple high-res monitors
either.</p><p>So I decided to implement a mixed hardware/software solution: my monitors (all monitors today really) have more
than one input, so I can connect all my computers simultaneously. The idea is:</p><ul><li>Switch USB devices in hardware.</li><li>Detect this switch in software, and switch monitors inputs as needed.</li></ul><p>To switch USB devices, I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N6GD9JO">this USB 3.0 two-computer switch</a> from Amazon,
that’s $38 Canadian, under $30 USD.</p><p>To automatically switch monitor inputs, I <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch">wrote some software</a>.</p><p>My plan was:</p><ul><li>Watch for USB device connections/disconnections.</li><li>When a configured device is connected, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI">DDC/CI</a> to
send a command to all connected monitors to switch inputs.</li><li>In case the power management turned the video output off, turn it on again (otherwise the monitors will auto-switch
back to the input that actually supplies video output).</li></ul><p>I needed this to happen on Windows and on a Mac, and mature cross-platform support for USB low-level
control and hot plug, DDC/CI and monitor power management is non-existent. I ended up implementing this two
times: <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/MacOS">once in Swift</a>, for MacOS, and the
<a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/Windows">second time in Rust</a>, for Windows.</p><p>Amazingly enough, this works really well: when I press the button on the USB switch, monitor input is changed
instantaneously, it feels like a “real” KVM switch! 🎉</p></div></div>]]>

One of the vulnerabilities allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) by sending specially crafted chat messages, either in group chats or directly to targeted users. No user interaction is required, and the vulnerability can be exploited even when Cisco Jabber is running in the background.</p><div data-module="editorial-page">
            <p><em>All vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed to Cisco and patches are available. If you or your organization are using Cisco Jabber, <strong>update now!</strong></em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/jabber-calc.gif" height="720" width="1280"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1: The Jabber RCE vulnerability in action.</em></p>
<p>Security consultants from Watchcom discovered the four high severity vulnerabilities while pen-testing for a client. The vulnerabilities affect all currently supported versions of the Cisco Jabber client (12.1 – 12.9). The four vulnerabilities and their corresponding CVE numbers are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2020-3495: Cisco Jabber Message Handling Arbitrary Code Execution (CVSS 9.9)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3430: Cisco Jabber Protocol Handler Command Injection (CVSS 8.0)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3498: Cisco Jabber Information Disclosure (CVSS 6.5)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3537: Cisco Jabber Universal Naming Convention Link Handling (CVSS 5.7)</li>
</ul>
<p>This article describes the technical details of the vulnerabilities and gives useful advice for detection and mitigation.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is a video conferencing and instant messaging application. It is mainly used for internal communication, but can also be used to chat, call or conduct meetings with people outside of the organization. These days a lot of people are working from home and applications like Cisco Jabber are essential to stay connected, communicate efficiently and keep businesses running smoothly.</p>
<p>Given their newfound prevalence in organizations of all sizes, these applications are becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers. A lot of sensitive information is shared through video calls or instant messages and the applications are used by the majority of employees, including those with privileged access to other IT-systems.</p>
<p>The security of these applications is therefore paramount, and it is important to ensure that both the applications themselves, and the infrastructure they are using, are regularly audited for security gaps.</p>
<p>During a recent penetration test for an unrelated client, security consultants Olav Sortland Thoresen and Torjus Bryne Retterstøl from Watchcom discovered four serious vulnerabilities in Cisco Jabber. The vulnerabilities range from medium to critical severity and two of the vulnerabilities can be used to gain remote code execution. The most severe vulnerability is also wormable, meaning that it can be used to automatically spread malware without any user interaction.</p>
<p>Watchcom immediately reported these vulnerabilities to Cisco and coordinated a responsible disclosure. Patches have been issued and all Cisco Jabber users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>All four vulnerabilities affect the Cisco Jabber client application and were tested on Windows. The Cisco Jabber client is based on the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and uses the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for instant messages and presence updates. These two technologies are important for understanding the vulnerabilities and their implications. A brief overview of each of them is therefore provided below.</p>
<h3>Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)</h3>
<p>CEF is a framework that allows developers to embed Chromium-based web browsers in their applications. It is used to create desktop applications based on web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Normally, the code running in the embedded web browser is sandboxed and cannot access files or perform system calls. While this is a good security measure, application developers often want such functionality in their application and therefore find or create ways to bypass the sandbox.</p>
<p><em><strong>This leaves applications vulnerable in scenarios where the sandbox normally would’ve provided protection.</strong></em></p>
<p>Additionally, many applications that use CEF choose to pass through command line flags to the embedded web browser. This means that many CEF applications accept <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags" target="_blank">Chromium command line flags</a>. Some of these flags can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs and should therefore be treated with caution.</p>
<h3>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</h3>
<p>XMPP is an XML-based protocol for instant messaging and presence. It is based on an open standard and is widely used in both open-source and proprietary software. XMPP is an extensible protocol and several extensions that provide additional functionality to the protocol exist.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure2.png" height="209" width="1137"> <em>Figure 2: An XMPP message containing both a plaintext and an HTML version of a message.</em></p>
<p>One of these extensions is XEP-0071: XHTML-IM. This extension defines how instant messages containing HTML formatted content can be exchanged over XMPP. Since HTML content can contain malicious elements, the specification states that applications must assume that messages containing HTML are malicious and sanitize them accordingly.</p>
<p>It also states that it must be possible for users to prevent automatic loading of images. Not all applications take such precautions and we will later see how this is the root cause of two of the vulnerabilities that we discovered.</p>
<h3>Cross Site Scripting Leading to RCE Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through XHTML-IM messages. The application does not properly sanitize incoming HTML messages and instead passes them through a flawed XSS filter.</p>
<p>The filter is based on a blacklist of known-bad tags and attributes, but it is not comprehensive. Since the application is based on CEF, its embedded web browser will execute any scripts that can pass through the filter.</p>
<p>We discovered that the filter could be bypassed using the lesser-known onanimationstart attribute. Tags that had this attribute were not caught by the filter and were directly inserted into the embedded web browser’s DOM. This attribute is used to specify a JavaScript function that will be called when an element’s CSS animation starts playing. To achieve XSS using this attribute the element must have an animation assigned to it. It was not possible to inject custom CSS animations since &lt;style&gt; tags were caught by the filter, but we discovered a built-in animation called spinner-grow by grepping through the files in the installation directory. By combining these two, it was possible to create malicious HTML tags that bypassed the filter and were executed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure3.png" height="387" width="1003"> <em>Figure 3: An XHTML-IM message that has been intercepted and modified. A malicious &lt;img&gt; tag has been added.</em></p>
<p>Cisco Jabber uses XHTML-IM by default for all messages. A malicious message can therefore easily be created by intercepting an XMPP message sent by the application and modifying it. Attackers can do this manually on their own machine or it can be automated to create a worm that spreads automatically.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure4.png" height="783" width="1123"> <em>Figure 4: When the victim receives the message, the JavaScript code is executed. In this case the code opens an alert box as a proof of concept.</em></p>
<p>After achieving XSS, we started looking for ways to escape the CEF sandbox. A vulnerable function (named window.CallCppFunction) was identified. This function is used to invoke native C++ code and the application uses it to, among other things, open files received from other Cisco Jabber users.</p>
<p>We discovered that this function can be abused by an attacker to run arbitrary executable files on the victim’s machine. The function takes a file:// URL as its second parameter and by manipulating this parameter an attacker can execute arbitrary .exe files.</p>
<p><em><strong>Since Cisco Jabber supports file transfers, an attacker can initiate a file transfer containing a malicious .exe file and force the victim to accept it using an XSS attack. </strong></em></p>
<p>The attacker can then trigger a call to window.CallCppFunction, causing the malicious file to be executed on the victim´s machine.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure5.png" height="464" width="794"> <em>Figure 5: An XHTML-IM message containing exploit code that escapes the CEF sandbox and launches calc.exe on the victim’s machine.</em></p>
<p>This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-3495 with a CVSS score of 9.9 (Critical) / CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H</p>
<h3>Protocol Handler Vulnerability</h3>
<p>While researching the XSS vulnerability, we discovered another high severity vulnerability concerning the handling of URLs with custom protocols.</p>
<p>Upon installation, Cisco Jabber registers protocol handlers for a number of different protocols. These are used to tell the operating system that whenever a user clicks on a URL containing one of the custom protocols (e.g. ciscoim:test@example.com) the URL should be passed to Cisco Jabber. In this case, the protocol handlers specify that the URL should be passed as a command line flag.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure6.png" height="255" width="1032"> <em>Figure 6: One of Cisco Jabber’s protocol handlers. The protocol handler specifies that URLs should be passed to the application as a command line flag.</em></p>
<p>These protocol handlers are vulnerable to command injection because they fail to consider URLs that contain spaces. By including a space in the URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line flags that will be passed to the application. Since the application uses CEF and accepts Chromium command line flags, several flags that can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs exist. An example of such a flag is --GPU-launcher. This flag specifies a command that will be executed when CEFs GPU process is started.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be combined with the XSS vulnerability to achieve code execution without transferring any files to the victim. This makes it possible to deliver malware without writing any files to disk, thus bypassing most antivirus software.</p>
<p>The video below shows the vulnerability being exploited. The attacker sends a malicious message, containing an XSS payload that escapes the CEF sandbox and uses the protocol handler vulnerability to execute commands on the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My day job is, officially, as a Growth Engineer working primarily on Unauth Product at Pinterest. It’s slightly different from my previous software engineering roles - typically, in other roles, I would be handed a spec sheet or design and had to implement it. Sometimes I’d design it myself, but the challenges were uniquely <em>technical</em> - I had to build something, and there was creativity in so far as what technologies and design patterns I’d use, but the features and product itself were usually dictated to you. They would either be so obvious that they were trivial, or they’d be handed down by some PM some point above the line.</p><p>Working on growth engineering is different - you’re responsible for the ideation and product, and focus around a north star metric, and can gauge the success of your ideas <em>objectively</em>. You own the entirety of the process, and have a quantifiable number at the end (for unauth and SEO, it’s usually traffic, time on site, and, most importantly, user acquisition).</p><p>This lends itself to an interesting focus at work every day. You want to build a product that is actually enjoyed and valuable to users, while still trying to “game” their attention and behavior.</p><p>The following are some thoughts I’ve had from working and consulting in growth at startups and companies of various sizes, mostly in the consumer tech space:</p><h2 id="thoughts-on-users-and-product">Thoughts on users and product</h2><ul><li><p>Trying to get users to do something is less like being an omnipotent god that tells people what to do than it is reshaping rivers of user intent. You can’t control what a user does, merely guide the flow of their actions. Adding a huge button doesn’t mean they’ll click on it.</p></li><li><p>Removing the ability to do something won’t prevent them from doing it (and will most likely just increase distaste for your product).</p></li><li><p>Users are simultaneously smarter and dumber than you think. Dumber in the sense that, when you take the average level of product comprehension for a user of any site that is used by a significant portion of the world population every day, it’s fairly low. Especially when you’re focused on new user acquisition, they don’t know what to expect, or how to use what you’re providing them. At the same time, though, they’re <strong>on your site for a reason</strong>, and usually know what they want.</p></li><li><p>You need to make sure to put yourself in the same headspace as your users. As someone building a product, you have to remember that you have a significantly higher familiarity with it than the people using it. You’ll have specific names for each product feature and know the user flows and reasoning behind each action, but for a lot of the people that visit your site, it’s their first time there.</p></li><li><p>It’s easy for me, as an early 20s San Francisco based software engineer, to have a fairly skewed perception of the world. Remember the user can have every possible demographic and characteristic.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you track what your users do when they come to your site, and experiment often with major shifts to your platform. It’s incredibly easy to <em>think</em> that users are doing something for a certain reason, when in reality it’s baseless.</p></li><li><p>Everything comes at a trade-off. Sometimes this is strictly better, metrics wise, but other times the trade-offs aren’t as clear - it doesn’t mean they don’t exist, though. The choices in button ordering, what you put above the fold, the font size, it all pulls and pushes the user experience in different directions.</p></li><li><p>Build for everyone, not just the professional. It’s easy when building products at work to be in a professional mindset - you’re not really thinking about <strong>every</strong> possible aspect that someone could be using your product for. Users get value in ways you never could predict - it’s better to build a platform that is flexible and ambiguous than imagine a single purpose use for what you’re building.</p></li><li><p>You do not and can not control users, and should view yourself more as at their mercy than them at yours. Working on a product is a lot more like swinging your arms around blindly in a room hoping you hit the light switch than it is knowing exactly what people want and how to deliver it to them.</p></li><li><p>Question all of your previous learnings. Something might’ve been true in the past, but is no longer. The same experiment or feature can lead to differences in results based on some slight change in the product or flow.</p></li></ul><h2 id="thoughts-on-growth">Thoughts on growth</h2><ul><li><p>Your user metrics are almost always proxies for what you’re trying to measure. You’ll pick some north star metric and say that this is what you’re building around, but this is just a shadow of what you’re trying to measure - the nebulous cloud of “user enjoyment”</p></li><li><p>Sometimes building a more aggressive user experience is worth it in the long run. For example: By default, your site could have a 2% conversion rate and a 20% bounce rate. A new feature is introduced behind an experiment that increases the conversion rate to 3%, but increases the bounce rate to 80%. This is clearly a subpar experience - it increases your bounce rate by 400%. However, it also increases your conversion rate by <strong>50%</strong>. Depending on your product this can make sense (for example, anything with an LTV for each user that is really high, or that has a really high CAC). It might not be ideal in the long term, but having a short term lever like this can be instrumental to a product’s success.</p></li><li><p>User growth is often cyclical. Some products will have the same traffic every day of the year, whereas others will have time of day, day of week, week of month, or seasonal patterns.</p></li><li><p>Monitor everything. As a product grows, you’ll build out one-off features that are significant wins at the time, but which aren’t actively monitored. It’s cheap to add a log to something and just page a team when it drops to 0. This is significantly eased by TDD, but TDD is rarely the right answer when your main concern is growth (you should move quickly).</p></li><li><p>You should move as quickly as possible. Don’t work on an idea for a long time - build out the smallest possible version that gives you directionality (positive or negative for the user metrics you’re looking at) and iterate from there. Especially in the early stages of a company, moving slowly and not adapting to shifting market conditions can kill you.</p></li><li><p>Growth is product + a direction + fuel. Each of these is a multiplier on the others - any combination of these can make a successful company. The dream is to have a great product that knows exactly where it wants to go, with all the resources it needs, but this is very rarely the case. More often than not you’ll have a mediocre product that’s floated along for a bit while being severely understaffed. If any of them is 0, you’re DOA. There’s no pithy truism here - a company can succeed <em>because</em> it has great direction and resources, or it can fail <em>in spite of it</em>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="success">Success</h2><p>One of the most important parts of the above is that they’re not static. These aren’t commandments that are written in stone - they’re learnings that are based on trial and error, off of experiments and conversations with users. You’ll run an experiment one day that contradicts nearly everything you’ve learned about growth and product, and you just have to re-baseline yourself and take those learnings forward.</p><p>You have a lot of control in so far as what the user sees and has access to - you can never control what they do with it, though. Building something that keeps the experience in mind, and that is focused on long term, sustainable growth is all you can hope to achieve.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>1st September 2020, by Elliott Brown</p>
<h4>Today we're announcing NUM, a new DNS-based protocol to store and retrieve structured data</h4>
<p>
  The Namespace Utility Modules (NUM) protocol can be used to store structured data for any domain name or email address. NUM&nbsp;records can be stored in the DNS of the independent NUM zone (e.g. <code>_num.example.com</code>) or in the hosted NUM zone (a DNS-based store of NUM records below the domain <code>num.net</code>) using a simple web interface: <a href="https://www.numserver.com/" target="_blank">NUM Server</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-external.png" title="Content on another site." alt="Content on another site.">.
</p>
<p>
  We're announcing this experimental protocol to the technical community today and are very interested in feedback and input.
</p>
<h5>Custom and standardised records</h5>
<p>
  Custom NUM records can store structured data for any purpose, particular use cases are standardised with <a href="https://www.num.uk/modules">modules</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-internal.png" title="Content elsewhere on this site." alt="Content elsewhere on this site.">. One of our leading use cases for NUM is contact information. Enabling organisations and individuals to store contact data in the DNS opens up lots of new possibilities like dialling a domain name or email address.
</p>
<h5>Automatically populating the DNS with millions of pieces of structured data</h5>
<p>
  As well as offering a simple, user-friendly way to adopt NUM, the NUM Server also helps overcome the chicken-and-egg problem. We&nbsp;intend to populate NUM records for millions of domain names based on website information hosted on those domain names. We&nbsp;expect to publish this data in early 2021.
</p>
<h5>Free, unrestricted and unlimited access to data</h5>
<p>
  Since NUM data is stored and served using DNS it's ultra-fast, reliable and massively scalable. Access to records on the NUM Server is free, unrestricted and unlimited forever. NUM enables organisations and individuals to take back control of their data and provides a valuable resource to developers building devices, apps and services.

<h5>Experimenting with NUM</h5>

<h2 id="what-is-xls">What is XLS?</h2>
<p>The XLS (Accelerated HW Synthesis) project aims to enable the rapid development
of <em>hardware IP</em> that also runs as efficient <em>host software</em> via "software
style" methodology.</p>
<p>XLS implements a High Level Synthesis (HLS) toolchain which produces
synthesizable designs from flexible, high-level descriptions of functionality.
It is fully Open Source: Apache 2 licensed and developed via GitHub.</p>
<p>XLS is used inside of Google for generating feed-forward pipelines from
"building block" routines / libraries that can be easily retargeted, reused, and
composed in a latency-insensitive manner.</p>
<p><em>Not yet available</em>, but active work in progress is the implementation of XLS
<em>concurrent processes</em>, in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) style, that
allow pipelines to communicate with each other and induct over time.</p>
<p>XLS is still experimental, undergoing rapid development, and not an officially
supported Google product. Expect bugs and sharp edges. Please help by trying it
out, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues">reporting bugs</a>, and letting us know
what you think!</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building From Source</h2>
<p>Currently, XLS must be built from source using the Bazel build system.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Binary distributions of the XLS library are not currently available, but
we hope to enable them via continuous integration, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues/108">see this issue</a>.</p>
<p>The following instructions are for the Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) Linux distribution.
Note that we start by assuming <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html">Bazel has been
installed</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Follow the bazel install instructions:
# https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html
#
# Afterwards we observe:

$ bazel --version
bazel 3.2.0

$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-dev libtinfo5

# py_binary currently assume they can refer to /usr/bin/env python
# even though Ubuntu 20.04 has no `python`, only `python3`.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8685

$ mkdir -p $HOME/opt/bin/
$ ln -s $(which python3) $HOME/opt/bin/python
$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

$ bazel test -c opt ...
</code></pre>

<p>A reference build/test environment setup is also provided via <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>~$ git clone https://github.com/google/xls.git
~$ cd xls
~/xls$ docker build .  # Performs optimized build and test.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="stack-diagram-and-project-layout">Stack Diagram and Project Layout</h2>
<p>Navigating a new code base can be daunting; the following description provides a
high-level view of the important directories and their intended organization /

</span><span>Videos</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>Texts</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>. The posts are similar enough that they will share certain attributes (like a title), but also different enough that they will require unique columns (a url column for video). In addition, we want to have a newsfeed feature where we display all posts by most recently created. This means we need to have a way to query across the entire</span> 
</span><span>Posts</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>architecture.</span></span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This problem is generally solved in one of two ways in Rails:</span> 
</span><span>single table inheritance</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>(STI) or</span> 
</span><span>abstract classes</span><span>. Since ActiveRecord models do not have to be backed by a database table, these solutions leverage Plain Old Ruby Objects in order to represent this inheritance hierarchy. Polymorphic associations also often get thrown into the mix but don't quite fit our use case (we’ll briefly touch on this). We’ll discuss the pros and cons of each of these approaches and shed light on a new Rails feature that combines the best of both worlds.</span></p>  
  
 <h4><span>Single Table Inheritance (STI)</span></h4> 
  
<p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>In an STI implementation, attributes are stored in a single parent class table and a</span> 
</span><span>type</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>column holds the name of the subclass for the given row. Subclasses inherit from the parent class which allows us to write Text specific methods on the Text class without polluting the Video class.&nbsp; Generating a newsfeed is also very straightforward since all the data is in a single table, i.e. we can do things like</span> 
</span><span>Posts.order(created_at: :desc)</span><span>.<br></span><span><br></span></p></div> <p><a id="1268435434" data-caption="STI example"><img src="https://lirp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/opt/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM-1920w.png" alt="" id="1798209722" data-dm-image-path="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM.png" onerror="handleImageLoadError(this)"></a> 
</p> 
 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1828567217" data-uialign="center"><p><span>STI is simple to implement but can quickly get unwieldy as slight differences in models introduce new fields.&nbsp; This leads to wide tables that are full of null values storing information for a collection of now distinct models that are forced to share the same table.</span></p>  
 <h4><span>Abstract Classes</span></h4> 
  
<p><span>Abstract Classes solve the problem of wide tables by giving each model its own table and connecting them via an Abstract Base Model - the parent class cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed to be utilized. Where the entire hierarchy was represented in a single table in STI, the opposite is true using abstract classes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This gives us the ability to separate unique attributes to distinct tables, but now we have the opposite problem - repetitive columns. The</span> 
</span><span>author</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>title</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>columns will have to be included in all subclasses. We have also lost the ability to query across the entire hierarchy (i.e.</span> 
</span><span>Posts.all</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>), making our newsfeed unnecessarily cumbersome.</span> 
</span></p></div>

</p> 
  
 <p><span>We've established that both methods have their strengths but are not without significant drawbacks. So what's the solution?</span></p> 
  
 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1670289024" data-uialign="center"> <h4><span>Delegated Types</span></h4> 
  
<p><span><span>*At the time of writing, this feature is only included in edge Rails and is expected to be included in the next minor release (6.1.0). However,</span> 
</span><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39341" target="_blank" runtime_url="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39341" type="url">the code</a><span> <span>can be pulled from the Rails codebase and included in ApplicationRecord to be used right away*</span></span></p><p><span>Delegated types take the best of STI and abstract classes and merge them into a single solution. Both the superclass and subclasses are backed by database tables, allowing for common attributes to live in the parent class table and unique attributes to live in the subclass tables.</span><span><br></span></p></div>

 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1860625639" data-uialign="center"><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>So what's happening here? By including</span> 
</span><span>delegated_type :postable</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>on the</span>

</span><span>postable</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>under the hood. So far, this is the same as setting up a regular polymorphic association minus the syntactical difference. However, where polymorphic relationships define an interface for a “has_many” relationship, delegated types define an interface for “has_one”. That distinction is what allows us to isolate shared attributes in a separate table, but still be able to retrieve values specific to a delegated type row.&nbsp;</span></span></p></div>

<b>Summary</b>: In this course we explain how category theory—a branch of mathematics known for its ability to organize the key abstractions that structure much of the mathematical universe—has become useful for writing elegant and maintainable code. In particular, we'll use examples from the Haskell programming language to motivate category-theoretic constructs, and then explain these constructs from a more abstract and inclusive viewpoint. Hands-on programming exercises will be used to demonstrate categorical ideas like "the universal property of products" in working Haskell code. A rough list of topics includes: 
</p><ol>
<li>Sets, types, categories, functors, natural transformations</li>
<li>Universal constructions and associated data types</li>
<li>Adjunctions and cartesian closed categories</li>
<li>Algebras, catamorphisms, anamorphisms</li>
<li>Monads, comonads, Kleisli arrows</li>
<li>Monoids, monoidal categories, lax monoidal functors, applicatives</li>
<li>Profunctors, (co)ends, optics</li>
</ol>
<b>We will assume no background knowledge on behalf of the student</b>, starting from scratch on both the programming and mathematics.

<p><em>Ordinary Clojure code - can be run in REPL or in command line with Babashka (the whole file can be found <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">here</a> )</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I never bothered to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> so that I could be really fluent with it. If I needed anything beyond basic Bash stuff I immediately used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> in command-line scripting.</p>

<p>I’m currently implementing my Clojure simple server again, this time using the <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/integrant">Integrant</a> library. In this new version, I implemented three data stores: CSV, AWS DynamoDB, and Postgres. I had already implemented importing development data into DynamoDB (using Python), this time I used <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/Babashka">Babashka</a> to import development data into Postgres - mainly just to have an excuse to try if I could replace Python with Clojure when scripting something with Bash.</p>

<p>The scripts can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure">Clojure git</a> repo in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developing-with-babashka">Developing with Babashka</h3>

<p>The really neat thing with Babashka is that you can develop your Babashka scripts as part of your Clojure project, or independently but using your favorite Clojure IDE. The picture above shows Clojure code in my favorite Clojure IDE, <a href="https://cursive-ide.com/">Cursive</a>. I have the Clojure code that imports data into the Postgres database in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>, so I have the following extra path in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/deps.edn">deps.edn</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span> </span><span>:postgres</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:extra-paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"postgres"</span><span>]}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the nice thing is that I can develop the Clojure code as part of project’s other Clojure code. Let’s first create a short bash script that tells Babashka to run your Clojure code with a flag so that we know in the Clojure code when we are running the code using Babashka or using Clojure IDE REPL (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">run-bb-load-data.sh</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#/bin/bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>simpleserver
<span>export </span><span>RUNNING_BB</span><span>=</span>TRUE
bb bb_postgres.clj
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The flag is the <code>RUNNING_BB</code> export above.</p>

<p>Then in the Clojure code we have a top level form <code>(run-me)</code> in the namespace (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">bb_postgres.clj</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-me</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
  </span><span>"Loads data only if running from Babashka script which sets the environment variable.
  We don't want the repl to load the data when reloading the namespace.
  In repl experimentation use the rich comment below."</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>System/getenv</span><span> </span><span>"RUNNING_BB"</span><span>)]</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>"TRUE"</span><span>)</span><span>
      </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>))))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>run-me</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I.e. when reloading the namespace REPL runs the code but if the flag is not set it doesn’t actually do anything - it imports the code only if we are running the code using Babashka. The reason for this is that when I reload the namespace as part of my Clojure workflow I don’t want the data import to happen. For development purposes to test importing data, or any other function, I have a <code>rich comment</code> at the end of the file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>comment</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>"dev-resources/data"</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-raw-products</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-product-groups</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>do</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-products!</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-product-groups!</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>load-users</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-product-groups</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-products</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>comment</code> block is here so that REPL does not run this code when reloading, of course. The function calls you see inside the comment block are just experiments added in no particular order. I can send any of these forms individually to be evaluated in the REPL - a typical Clojure trick when developing with REPL.</p>

<h3 id="babashka-use-cases">Babashka Use Cases</h3>

<p>I really like the idea that I can now use Clojure in shell scripting. Of course I could use Clojure in shell scripting also without Babashka but JVM boot takes quite a long time which makes testing of the script in command line a bit painful. Not so with Babashka - Babashka boots lightning fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ&gt; <span>time </span>bb <span>'(println "Hello world!")'</span>
Hello world!

real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.003s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The use cases using Babashka in my personal scripting probably is a bit like I used Babashka to import data into the Postgres database in this exercise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-sql</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>command</span><span>]</span><span>

<p>I.e. parsing CSV, transforming data, and then call some program with the transformed data, possibly read what was returned and do other stuff. You could possibly do all this using plain old Bash but I never bothered to learn Bash in that level that I can do more than test some flags and call other programs using Bash.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-babashka-script-in-this-exercise">How Do I Use the Babashka Script in This Exercise?</h3>

<p>I used Babashka to load development data into the Postgres data store. During development I built a custom Postgres image and provided a <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> recipe to start the data store (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/Justfile">Justfile</a>):</p>

<h3 id="clojure-babashka-vs-python-in-shell-scripting">Clojure (Babashka) vs Python in Shell Scripting</h3>

<p>Let’s finally compare Python and Clojure (Babashka) when doing some Linux shell scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Easiness</strong>. Both languages are pretty easy and fast to work if you have used them. Developing Python scripts is pretty fast - you just run the script in command line. Working with Clojure has one additional plus: you can use the Clojure REPL.</p>

<p><strong>Library support</strong>: Python wins. When you are scripting in Python and you realize that it would be nice e.g. to use some AWS library - just use it (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/dynamodb/pysrc/table_importer.py">table_importer.py</a> - the AWS <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">boto3</a> library). The library support for Babashka is not as extensive, of course - but Babashka supports quite many namespaces outside <code>clojure.core</code> and also some additional libraries: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka#built-in-namespaces">Babashka built-in namespaces</a> - keep eye on that page, maybe Babashka library support is growing in the future!</p>

<p>So, the library support might not be as good as with Python. But I really do love Clojure and if I’m implementing apps using Clojure it is really nice to do some ad hoc scripting using Babashka.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It’s nice to have another scripting tool in my toolbox: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">Babashka</a>. Time will tell if I start using Clojure instead of Python as my preferred scripting language, thanks to Babashka. At least in this exercise Babashka did really well.</p>

                <!-- Toc if any -->

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15

17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7

16
17
18
19

23
24
</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When I was 15</strong>, one of my closest friends died unexpectedly. Our physics teacher broke the news to me after Iâ€™d sat an exam, having wondered all the way through why my friend wasnâ€™t there doing the same. I still donâ€™t have the words to describe how I felt: it was something approaching shock, distress, disorientation. I didnâ€™t know what to think, much less what to do. I spent many nights awake and many days in a daze.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, when I was in graduate school, another friend died suddenly, a man I loved very much. I remember checking my phone and finding out, to my dismay, via text message. But while my initial response was much the same as before, there was a palpable difference in how I felt later on. While I was again surprised and saddened, I was much less disoriented than Iâ€™d been as a teenager. I could still think, and I could still get things done. It seemed to me that Iâ€™d become better at living with loss.</p>
<p>You might think that the reason for this difference is obvious â€“ I was older, and Iâ€™d had more experience in coping with death. But raw experience alone isnâ€™t enough: what matters more is whether we learn from experience. And learning from experience, especially an experience as difficult as the death of a loved one, can involve quite a lot. Among other things, it can involve creativity.</p>
<p>This claim might seem surprising. After all, creativity is often associated with the idea of a lone creative genius, an individual who not only excels at what they do, but also transforms the world in the process. Further, even if we donâ€™t limit ourselves to romantic or heroic perspectives on the nature and value of creativity, itâ€™s commonly thought that creativity at least aims at novelty or originality.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about creativity isnâ€™t universal. The <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-complete-works-of-zhuangzi/9780231164740"><em>Zhuangzi</em></a> (èŽŠå­�), a classical Chinese philosophical and literary text, provides a different perspective. On one interpretation, creativity isnâ€™t conceived as aiming at novelty or originality, but rather <em>integration</em>. Instead of aiming at something new, it aims at something that combines well with the situation of which itâ€™s a part.</p>
<p>The story of Wheelwright Pian, from a chapter of the Zhuangzi known as the <em>Tian Dao</em> (å¤©é�“), meaning â€˜Heavenâ€™s Wayâ€™ or â€˜The Way of Heavenâ€™, effectively illustrates this perspective on creativity as it pertains to artists or artisans. In this short vignette, a wheelwright known as Pian (æ‰�) tells a duke that the book of sagesâ€™ advice heâ€™s reading is nothing but â€˜chaff and dregsâ€™. Angered, the duke demands an explanation. The wheelwright responds that, at least concerning his craft, he can create what he does only because heâ€™s developed a â€˜knackâ€™ for it that canâ€™t be wholly conveyed in words. If the blows of his mallet are too gentle, his chisel slides and wonâ€™t take hold. If theyâ€™re too hard, it bites in and wonâ€™t budge. â€˜Not too gentle, not too hard â€“ you can get it in your hand and feel it in your mind,â€™ he says. â€˜So, Iâ€™ve gone along for 70 years and at my age Iâ€™m still chiselling wheels. When the men of old died, they took with them the things that couldnâ€™t be handed down. So, what you are reading there must be nothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of old.â€™</p>
<p>Although heâ€™s a â€˜lowlyâ€™ craftsperson, the wheelwright has something important to teach the duke. Heâ€™s been creating wheels by hand for many years and has developed an ability to act and to execute his craft in an integrated manner that canâ€™t be fully captured through an algorithmic list of instructions. He responds to precise particularities in the wood, his tools and his body to create what he wants â€“ something he doesnâ€™t accomplish by imposing a plan.</p>
<p>Striving for originality can be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results</p>
<p>The sagesâ€™ advice for living well is therefore mere â€˜dregsâ€™ if itâ€™s interpreted as instructions that one can simply read and then complete. Living well in general involves much more than this; namely, a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the hard and the soft, as well as the learned and the spontaneous, the active and the passive, and even the unproductive and the productive â€“ all of which apply in the case of carving wheels, as well as elsewhere. In other words, living well involves creativity.</p>
<p>This kind of creativity isnâ€™t taken to aim at novelty or originality as such. The wheelwright is presented as creative not because of anything to do with his, or his projectsâ€™, novelty or originality, but instead because of his ability to create wheels in a sensitive, responsive and â€“ crucially â€“ well-integrated manner: one not learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity.</p>
<p>We can use the story of Wheelwright Pian to better understand why learning to live with loss is a creative pursuit. Although thereâ€™s an abundance of books dispensing advice on how to do so, ultimately learning to live with death is a deeply personal endeavour that â€“ like carving wheels â€“ canâ€™t be fully captured through a programmatic set of directions. We must respond to precise particularities of our situation (concerning our thoughts, feelings and overall circumstances) to create what we want to create (such as a sense of peace or closure). This isnâ€™t something that can be accomplished by imposing a plan, even if we make various provisional and highly malleable â€˜plansâ€™ on the fly as we go along.</p>
<p>Moreover, in working through our thoughts, feelings and circumstances in all their particularities, itâ€™s not that weâ€™re doing anything all that different from what countless others have had to do as theyâ€™ve learned to cope with loss. Nonetheless â€“ again, like carving wheels â€“ itâ€™s plausibly a creative activity, in that it involves a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the grieving and the celebratory, the resentful and the grateful, the distressed and the joyous. The ability to live with death, too, in a sensitive, responsive, and well-integrated manner isnâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity. Indeed, even the philosopher Zhuangzi himself can be understood as engaging in such a creative process after the death of his own wife in chapter 18 of the text, the <em>Zhi Le</em> (è‡³æ¨‚), meaning â€˜Perfect Happinessâ€™ or â€˜Perfect Joyâ€™.</p>
<p><strong>This way of thinking</strong> about creativity has a variety of other potential benefits. First, even if creativity were taken to aim at originality, de-emphasising originality might ironically result in greater creativity. This is because striving for originality can actually be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results: if we focus on the task of achieving something original, weâ€™ll explore only the range of possibilities deemed sufficiently likely to yield that result, leaving out a lot that could have contributed to achieving something original.</p>
<p>But imagine instead that we worked with idea that creativity wasnâ€™t about novelty. That doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™d have to give up the value of originality entirely, but rather see it as one of a range of possible outcomes. Casting a wider net in this way might hence make creativity (whatever it involves) easier to achieve.</p>
<p>Second, focusing on integration could encourage us to better understand creative agents as being intimately connected with, and products of, their environments. This would broaden our notion of creativity in a way that might allow us to see creativity demanded in a greater range of activities. After all, many of lifeâ€™s activities, from the mundane to the meaningful, arenâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via spontaneous action that integrates contrasting aspects. Just for starters, additional examples might include getting along with oneâ€™s family, building relationships with colleagues and organising oneâ€™s finances.</p>
<p>This alternative perspective on creativity might help us to see it as an everyday phenomenon in which we all participate â€“ rather than an extraordinary talent or gift that only a few enjoy. And it might also allow us to make sense of the idea of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43893-1_19#:~:text=As%20an%20art%20practice%2C%20calligraphy,Daoist%20aesthetic%20concerns%20discussed%20here.&amp;text=The%20aesthetic%20of%20the%20everyday,and%20the%20need%20for%20imagination">living creatively</a>: of an integrated life, lived spontaneously, in which all of lifeâ€™s contrasting aspects can be arranged to form a rich and variegated whole.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[The problem with C compatibility in C++]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>Generally accepted accounting principles were designed to create a single standard for comparing any and all businesses using the same terms and metrics. This is a very powerful tool, but it is a clear exchange for breadth over specificity. As a result, the economic reality of a business will likely differ from what the accounting metrics represent. By looking at a subset of business models, we can improve specificity - terms like <em>ARR </em>and <em>GMV</em> are both examples of this. While these terms have their own challenges with definitions, I think most agree what they represent: ARR is annualized recurring revenue for SaaS companies, and GMV is gross merchandise/marketplace value for marketplace companies.</p><p>One of my favorite examples of this is CAC - customer acquisition cost. It’s relevant for both SaaS businesses and marketplaces. Average CAC is the cost to acquire a single customer and Total CAC is the full spend for a cohort of customers. So what is the difference between <strong>CAC</strong> and <strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> expense? The truth is that Total CAC and S&amp;M over a given period of time <em>might </em>be the same. That being said, the usually differ by a <em>time offset </em>that depends on <strong><em>sales cycle length</em></strong>.</p><p>The critical distinction is <strong>sales cycle length</strong>. <em>Sales cycle is how long it takes for a customer to go from first contact to closing a deal</em>. We measure sales cycle by segment and can use simple reports in Salesforce or another CRM tool to figure out how long it takes on average for customers to move through the sales funnel. Generally sales opportunities begin as leads, some of those convert to <em>qualified for sales</em> and then some of those convert to <em>closed-won</em>. The Sales Funnel shows the volume and conversion at each step in the process and is usually in the hands of the CRO or sales operations team. The two lengths of time that we care about in finance are: top of funnel to sales qualification (i.e. marketing cycle length) and then sales qualification to closed-won (i.e. sales cycle length).</p><p>There is a large variance in sales cycle lengths from business to business. For example, consumer software might have a &lt;1 month sales cycle that runs entirely on marketing. On the other end of the spectrum, a complex sale to a large institution may take over a year and involve a number of different people and teams.</p><p>For the in-month sales cycle, New ARR in Month X will be attributed to the Marketing expense in Month X. Pretty straightforward.</p><p>As soon as you have a separate marketing funnel and sales funnel and things take longer than a few weeks, it becomes more complicated to measure, track and predict.</p><p>I often see operating stats that look like this:</p><figure id="w-node-be6f6b2d374d-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f755f630ab3e0e98ebd_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F79d18d99-150c-4eae-b10a-cc00916f9da3_1168x196.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The high level sales efficiency metric is New ARR / S&amp;M: the idea being that we are investing in S&amp;M in order to generate new ARR. The missing piece of information here is <strong>how long are the customers in the marketing funnel and how long are they in the sales funnel</strong>. Without that info, people often assume that it is in the same time period - whether that is a month, a quarter or a year. Switching over to a CAC calculation based on sales cycle length gives a more accurate picture of the sales efficiency.<br></p><p>For example: let’s say the marketing funnel takes <strong>1 month</strong> and the sales funnel takes <strong>3 months</strong>.<br></p><p>As a result, CAC would be the Marketing expense from 3 months prior and the average of the Sales expense over the last 3 months. So in the above example, new ARR acquired in April would be associated with the Marketing spend in January and the average of the Sales spend in Feb, March and April. Because this is a growing business, CAC will be lower than the S&amp;M in the same month, meaning that efficiency numbers are actually higher when based on CAC. Quick note to operating executives: don’t use a basic formula and sell yourself short.<br></p><p>Now looking at it through the lens of sales cycle-dependent CAC:<br></p><figure id="w-node-5b3f68252472-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f8ca3a860067d1d36b8_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fce0d6249-9d70-4cff-87bb-36004dfe03c8_1168x278.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Once you have the CAC line in the model, you can use it for SaaS Magic number, CAC payback, and a number of other metrics. (Of course, as the sales cycle changes, the CAC calculation must also change.) These metrics are important because they usually stay constant for a given product and business operation and allow you to project into the future.</p><p>The CAC calculation gets you one level deeper towards operating metrics from the high level financial metrics and is often a good bridge between the two. It represents the detailed funnels at a high level, and will ultimately drive projections with a higher degree of accuracy. For example, we now know that leads acquired through marketing spend in December will not yield sales until 3 months later in March. Based on historical metrics, we know roughly how many leads this spend will get us and therefore what kind of sales capacity we need to close on those leads and can plan sales hiring accordingly.<br></p><p>Coming from the financial perspective down into the operating perspective is a bit of a rabbit hole, so there’s an art in knowing where to stop, and it’s usually the point where precision starts to overtake accuracy in the model and digging deeper stops yielding better results. One step down from this, for example, would be to look into the sales expense - sales people are generally paid 50%+ of their total salary in commissions. If those commissions are paid in the month of sale, half of the sales expense should be weighted from that month and the other half weighted across the earlier months. If sales people are paid later on, then looking at it from a purely economic perspective as it pertains to commission rates will yield a much better result than looking at the accounting outputs for sales expense.<br></p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Recently I came across a <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/if-else-is-a-poor-mans-polymorphism-ab0b333b7265">blog post</a>
whose author claims, from the perspective of good coding practices, polymorphism is strictly superior to branching. 
In the post they make general statements about how branching statements lead to unreadable, unmaintainable, inflexible code and
how they are a sign of immaturity. However, in my opinion, the topic is much deeper and in this post 
I try to objectively discuss the reasons for and against branching.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Before I dive into polymorphism vs branching dilemma, let’s first define what we mean when we say some code is
flexible and easy to extend. In my career I reviewed thousands of lines of code, and I had thousands of lines of my code
reviewed by others, and during these reviews it often occured that the terms <em>code extensibility</em> or <em>flexibility</em> 
mean different things to different people. Familiarity with the code-base or particular programming style plays a huge role.</p>

<p>For example, someone used to writing code in a Java/C# OOP style would generally consider dynamic polymorphism through 
interfaces a standard way of providing extensibility to the code, 
while a C programmer may find a switch or if/else much more 
approachable than OOP. There are also many other factors related 
to maintainability as quality of documentation, good naming, separation of concerns, etc. These factors are orthogonal 
to the “polymorphism vs branching” dimension and also far too broad for a single blog post, so I won’t discuss them.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post, let’s define <em>extensibility</em> as the inverse of number of distinct units in the codebase
that need to be changed in order to implement a new feature. The more places you have to touch to implement the feature, 
the harder the code is to change. Obviously, it is much better when you have to touch only
one unit of code (one function, one class, one module, one package) rather than change 10 distinct unrelated units.</p>


<p>Imagine you’re writing a calculator. Your program gets an expression as an input and outputs the computed value.
For example the user inputs <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> and the output is <code>7</code> 
(or <code>9</code> if you’ve messed up the operator precedence like one of my former CS students).</p>

<p>Why such a silly example? Who is writing calculators these days? Probably no-one, but this looks like a classic example given
in many programming classes. And it is easy enough to illustrate the concept.</p>

<p>How can we model a structure to represent an expression?
You’d probably use classes or structures. Here is the code in Scala:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>+</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then it is quite easy to build an expression and evaluate it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)).</span><span>eval</span> <span>// evaluates to 5 </span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>This OOP-based solution is indeed very extensible when it comes to add a new operator.
The example above is missing subtraction operation. We can add one by defining a new class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Sub</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>-</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s really awesome – we didn’t have to touch any old code at all! 
OOP definitely rocks here.</p>


<p>Imagine you continued to extend our calculation engine with more operation classes over the next few years.
You’ve added multiplication, division, modulo, variables, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a new requirement comes – users want to not only evaluate the value of an expression,
but also do symbolic manipulation – e.g. simplify expressions. For example, given an expression
<code>a + a</code> they want to get an expression <code>2 * a</code> as a result.</p>

<p>This requirement can’t be captured by the <code>eval</code> method on the <code>Expression</code> interface. We need a new method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And as the next step, they would likely want to be able to display the expression as a String:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How many units of code do you have to change now to implement these features?
<strong>All the implementations of <code>Expression</code></strong>. Before touching all the classes, the code wouldn’t even compile.
It looks like in the context of this kind of feature, our polymorphic solution is terribly non-extensible.</p>


<p>Let’s take a step back and let’s see how we could implement this differently.
Scala and many other modern languages have a feature called <em>pattern matching</em>
which can be considered a very flexible, powerful switch.</p>

<p>Instead of defining the operations like <code>eval</code> or <code>simplify</code> on the case classes,
let’s pull them up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>


<span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now adding a new operation like <code>Sub</code> would require two changes to the code – adding a new class
<em>and</em> adding a new case in the match (switch) statement.</p>

<p>Some may say this much worse not only because of more places to update, but because of a possibility of
forgetting to update the switches which could lead to runtime errors due to unhandled cases.
Fortunately, Scala designers thought about this by providing the <code>sealed</code> keyword, which instructs the compiler
that all case classes can be defined in the same module only. This unlocks pattern exhaustiveness analysis and the
compiler would warn about missing cases:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sealed</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>

<span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about adding new functions like <code>simplify</code> or <code>toString</code>? 
It requires to changle only <strong>one place</strong> – by adding the required methods. 
No changes to the existing code are needed!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>other</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>other</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"("</span> <span>+</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>" + "</span> <span>+</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"</span><span>)</span> 
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>The blog post I mentioned in the introduction stated that using polymorphism instead of
branching leads to more readable code. I find this statement far too general and actually very debatable.</p>

<p>First, even in their own example given by the author of that blog, the solution using branching was a lot
shorter and less complex than the solution using OOP. While brief code is not always more readable than a longer version of it,
in that case, I found branching to be very explicit and easy to follow. 
It is much easier to understand the control flow
in such a program because all targets are explicitly given in a single place. In the OOP solution, 
the actual implementations are hidden behind the interface and it is much harder to find them all without additional 
help of a good IDE with a “jump to implementations” feature 
(which fortunately often works well for statically typed languages, but I’ve seen IDEs sometimes 
struggle with dynamic languages like Python).</p>

<p>Second, in general case, branching has an advantage that the function logic may depend on more than
one object type or even the actual data. For example, in the example from this post, 
the transformation <code>a * (b + c)</code> =&gt; <code>a * b + a * c</code> would depend on 
both addition and multiplication. In the classic OOP solution, would you place it in the <code>Add</code> or in the <code>Mul</code> class? 
Neither seems right. Also, putting it into one of them creates a dependency on the other one. 
An expression simplifier with code scattered accross multiple classes heavily depending on each other 
would be hard to understand.</p>


<p>This is a blog on high performance programming, so the post would be incomplete without a 
section on performance. In theory, a sufficiently good compiler should produce the same
code regardless of the choice between branching or dynamic polymorphism, but is this the case in reality?
Compilers have limitations and often don’t generate the best result code possible.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a more realistic example this time.
Some time ago I was working on serializing/deserializing code in a database system.
I stumbled upon a set of classes that described data types. They all implemented 
a common interface defining methods for serializing and deserializing values of given data type
and also computing serialized data lenghts. The following Rust snippet is a huge simplification 
of that code, but it illustrates the concept:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>BoolType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>IntType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>4</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>data_type</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>data_type</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given a reference to a <code>DataType</code> object, it is trivial to compute the data size associated with it, 
without knowing the exact static type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>t1</span> <span>=</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>t2</span> <span>=</span> <span>LongType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>t1</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>t2</span><span>];</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 4</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="performance-of-dynamic-dispatch">Performance of Dynamic Dispatch</h2>

<p>The implementation of the <code>data_len</code> function is actually very simple:</p>


<p>Wow! A single assembly instruction! 
It jumps to the address stored in the the vtable of the object pointed by the <code>rsi</code> register.
The target of the jump depends on the actual type of the object. Here is the code generated for <code>IntType.len</code>:</p>



<p>The codes for the other types differ only in the constant value.</p>

<p>These are only 3 instructions to return the result. Shouldn’t it be fast? 
Let’s measure this. Let’s put more random <code>DataType</code> objects …</p></article></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://erickhun.com/posts/kubernetes-faster-services-no-cpu-limits/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://erickhun.com/posts/kubernetes-faster-services-no-cpu-limits/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>At Buffer, we’ve been using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/buffer/">Kubernetes since 2016</a>.  We’ve been managing our k8s (kubernetes) cluster with <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kops</a>, it has about 60 nodes (on AWS), and runs about 1500 containers. Our transition to a micro-service architecture has been full of trial and errors. Even after a few years running k8s, we are still learning its secrets. This post will talk about how something we thought was a good thing, but ended up to be not as great as we thought: <strong>CPU limits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-limits-and-throttling">CPU limits and Throttling</h2>
<p>It is s general recommendation to set CPU limits. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits">Google, among others, highly recommends it</a>. The danger of not setting a CPU limit is that containers running in the node could exhaust all CPU available. This can trigger a cascade of unwanted events such as having key Kubernetes processes (such as <code>kubelet</code>) to become unresponsive. So it is in theory a great thing to set CPU limit in order to protect your nodes.</p>
<p>CPU limits is the maximum CPU time a container can uses at a given period (100ms by default). The CPU usage for a container will never go above that limit you specified. Kubernetes use a mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler">CFS Quota</a> to <strong>throttle</strong> the container to prevent the CPU usage from going above the limit. That means CPU will be artificially restricted, making the performance of your containers lower (and slower when it comes to latency).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-happen-if-we-dont-set-cpu-limits">What can happen if we don’t set CPU limits?</h2>
<p>We unfortunately experienced the issue. The <code>kubelet</code> , a process running on every node, and in charge of managing the containers (pods)  in the nodes became unresponsive. The node will turn into a <code>NotReady</code> state, and containers (pods) that were present will be rescheduled somewhere else, and create the issue in the new nodes. Definitely not ideal isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-throttling-and-latency-issue">Discovering the throttling and latency issue</h2>
<p>A key metric to check when you are running container is the <code>throttling</code> . This indicate the number of time your container has been throttled. Interestingly, we’ve discovered a lot of containers having throttling no matter if the CPU usage was near the limits or not. Here the example of one of our main API:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-usage-limits.png" alt="Kubernetes pods CPU usage and limits"></p>
<p>You can see in the animation that the CPU limits is set at <code>800m</code> (0.8 core, 80% of a core), and the peak usage is at most <code>200m</code> (20% of a core). After seeing, we might think we have plenty of CPU to let the service running before it throttle right? . Now check this one out:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-throttling-low-usage.gif" alt="Kubernetes pods Low CPU usage, High limit, lot of throttling"></p>
<p>You can notice the CPU throttling occurs, even though the CPU usage is below the CPU Limits. The maximum CPU usage isn’t even near the CPU limits.</p>
<p>We’ve then found a few resources(<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">github issue</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFApeaGv7A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1204">zanado talk</a>,  <a href="https://medium.com/omio-engineering/cpu-limits-and-aggressive-throttling-in-kubernetes-c5b20bd8a718">omio post</a>) talking about how throttling lead to poorer performances and latency for your services.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we see CPU throttling while CPU usage is low?</strong>
The tldr is basically a bug in the Linux kernel throttling unecessarly containers with CPU limit. If you’re curious about the nature of it, I invite you to check Dave Chiluk’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7QX98-kO0">great talk</a>, a <a href="https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2019/12/unthrottled-fixing-cpu-limits-in-the-cloud/">written version</a> also exists with more details.</p>

<p>After many long discussions, we’ve decided to remove the CPU limits for all services that were directly or indirectly on the critical path of our users.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an easy decision since we value the stability of our cluster. We’ve experimented in the past some instability in our cluster with services using too much resources and disrupting all other services present in the same node.  That time was a bit different, we understood more about how our services needed to be and had a good strategy to roll this out.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-keep-your-nodes-safe-when-removing-limits-">How to keep your nodes safe when removing limits ?</h2>
<p><strong>Isolating “No CPU Limits” services:</strong></p>
<p>In the past we’ve seen some nodes going to a <code>notReady</code> state, mainly because some services were using too much resources in a node.</p>
<p>We’ve decided to put those services on some specific nodes (tainted nodes), so those services will not disrupt all the “bounded” ones.  We have better control and could identify easier if any issue occurs with a node. We did this by tainting some nodes and adding toleration to services that were “unbounded”. Check <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/">the documentation</a> on how you can do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/buffer-k8s-infrastructure-nodes.jpg" alt="Buffer k8s nodes infrastructure"></p>
<p><strong>Assigning the correct CPU and memory request:</strong></p>
<p>The main worry we had was service using too much resources and leading to nodes becoming unresponsive. Because we now had great observability of all services running in our cluster (with Datadog), I’ve analyzed a few months of usage of each service we wanted to “unbound”. I’ve assigned the maximum CPU usage as the CPU request with a &gt; 20% margin. This will make sure to have allocated space in a node. If k8s won’t try to schedule any other service in that node.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/choose-cpu-request-based-on-max.png" alt="Chose CPU request based on max"></p>
<p>You can see in the graph that the peak CPU usage was <code>242m</code> CPU core (0.242 CPU core). Simply take this number and make it a bit higher to become the CPU request. You can notice that since the service is user facing, the peak CPU usage matches peak traffic time.</p>
<p>Do the same with your memory usage and requests, and you will be all set!
To add more safety, you can use the horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have room for it. Set an alert if your cluster do not have any room, or use the node austoscaler to add it automatically.</p>
<p>The downsides are that we lose in “<a href="https://wiki.openvz.org/WP/Containers_density">container density</a>”, the number of containers that can run in a single node. We could also end up with a lot of “slack” during a low traffic time.
You could also hit some high CPU usage, but nodes autoscaling should help you with it.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I’m happy to publish really great results after few weeks of experimentation, we’ve already seen really great latency improvements across all the services we’ve modified:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/speedup-no-cpu-limits2.png" alt="faster-kubernetes-containers"></p>
<p>The best result happened on our main landing page (<a href="https://buffer.com/">buffer.com</a>) where we speed the service up to <strong>22x</strong> faster!</p>

<h2 id="is-the-linux-kernel-bug-fixed">Is the Linux kernel bug fixed?</h2>
<p>The bug <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=763a9ec06c4">has been fixed and merged into the kernel</a> for Linux distribution running 4.19 or higher (kudo again to <a href="https://twitter.com/dchiluk">Dave Chiluk</a> for finding and fixing that).</p>
<p>However, as for <em>September 2nd 2020</em>, when reading <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">the kubernetes issue</a>, we can see various Linux projects that keep referencing the issue, so I guess some Linux distribution still have the bug and working into integrating the fix.</p>
<p>If you are below a Linux distribution that has a kernel version below 4.19, I’d recommend you to upgrade to the latest Linux distribution for your nodes, but in any case, you should try removing the CPU limits and see if you have any throttling.  Here a non exhausting list of various managed Kubernetes services or Linux distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian: The latest version <a href="https://erickhun.com/posts/kubernetes-faster-services-no-cpu-limits/%5Bhttps://www.debian.org/releases/buster/">buster</a> has the fix,  it looks <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1167353/accepted-linux-latest-419-105deb10u5deb9u1-source-amd64-into-oldstable-oldstable/">quite recent (august 2020)</a>. Some previous version might have get patched</li>
<li>Ubuntu: The latest version <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu Focal Fosa 20.04</a> has the fix.</li>
<li>EKS has the fix since <a href="https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/175">December 2019</a>. Upgrade your AMI if you have a version below than that</li>
<li>kops: Since <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9283">June 2020</a>,  <code>kops 1.18+</code> will start using <code>Ubuntu 20.04</code> as the default host image. If you’re using a lower version of kops, you’ll have to probably to wait the fix. We are currently in this situation.</li>
<li>GKE (Goggle Cloud) : The kernel fix was merged in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes#cos-stable-77-12371-141-0">January 2020</a>. But it does looks like throttling are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24356903">still hapenning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ps: Feel free to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> if you have more precise information, I’ll update the post accordingly</p>
<p><strong>If the fix solved the throttling issue?</strong></p>
<p>I’m unsure if totally solved the issue. I will give it a try once we hit a kernel version where the fix has been implemented and will update this post accordingly. If anyone have upgrade I’m keen to hear their results.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you run Docker containers under Linux (no matter Kubernetes/Mesos/Swarm) you might have your containers underperforming because of throttling</li>
<li>Upgrade to the latest version of your distribution hoping the bug is fixed</li>
<li>Removing CPU limit is a solution to solve this issue, but this is dangerous and should be made with extra-care (prefer upgrading your kernel first and monitor throttling first)</li>
<li>If you remove CPU limits, carefully monitor CPU and  memory usage in your nodes, and make sure your CPU requests are</li>
<li>A safe way to is to use the Horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have space.</li>
</ul>
<p>👉<strong>Hacker news update: lot of insighful <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comments</a>. I’ve updated the post to have better recommendations. You should prefer upgrading your kernel version over removing the CPU limits. Be really mindful, set the proper CPU requests, add the necessary monitoring when you do this</strong></p>
<p>I hope this post helps you get performance gains on the containers you are running. If so, don’t hesitate to share or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> with always some insighful comments</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Starting an IHP app</strong>

                    <p>
                        Let's first take a look at what happens when you start your IHP app by running <code>./start</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/start" target="_blank"><code>./start</code></a> script in your project is basically just a small wrapper that makes sure that all dependencies that are managed by nix are available and then calls the <code>RunDevServer</code> binary. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs" target="_blank">This binary is part of IHP</a> and does the actual application startup as well as managing the postgres server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can think of <code>RunDevServer</code> as a small process manager. When <code>RunDevServer</code> is started, it will directly start all processes required for your application to run:
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>the web-based IDE</li>
                            <li>a status server on port 8000 showing the compiler status and possible type errors</li>
                            <li>a websocket server used for communicating file changes for live reloading</li>
                            <li>a ghci (the standard haskell REPL) where it directly loads your app</li>
                            <li>a postgres server bound to unix socket</li>
                            <li>a file watcher to track haskell and css file changes</li>
                        </ul>
                    

                    <p>
                        All these processes are started in parallel for fast performance and synchronised in the main event loop of the dev server. Made possible thanks to haskells great concurrency capabilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important process is the ghci process with your app. Instead of fully recompiling your app on every file change, IHP loads your app in the repl and then refreshes only the changed files. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At first ghci needs a couple of seconds to load all haskell files of your application. While loading your application the status server is serving all http requests on localhost:8000. The status server will also show all type errors in case ghci failed to load your app. When the ghci finished loading, the status server is stopped and your application is started on localhost:8000.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Haskell File Changes</strong>

                    <p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTjjDo57B8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once your application is started, the dev server mainly deals with file changes. Using a file watcher the dev server is notified about any changes to your haskell files in your project. When a haskell file is changed the app process running in the ghci process is stopped and a refresh (<code>:r</code>) is triggered. The refresh is usually very fast. Once completed the app server will be started again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the haskell app has started, open browser pages will be notified using a websocket connection. The open pages will fetch the current page via ajax and will then update the dom using <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom" target="_blank">a diff and patch approach</a>. So only dom nodes that have actually changed will be touched during the live reloading. This approach will keep existing page state like scroll position or text typed into a form field. It allows for a very fast and productive feedback cycle.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>CSS File Changes</strong>

                    <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ihp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ihp</a> also supports live reloading of CSS. <a href="https://t.co/uRCCr3gkHz">pic.twitter.com/uRCCr3gkHz</a></p>— digitally induced (@digitallyinduce) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitallyinduce/status/1277583045919375363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 
                    

                    <p>
                        IHP also supports live reloading of CSS files. Once IHP sees a file change to your CSS files in the <code>static</code> directory it will notify all open browser tabs using its websocket connection. Once notified in the browser IHP will look for any <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> and <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/lib/IHP/static/livereload.js#L68" target="_blank">will reload the css file using a cache buster</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Type Errors</strong>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes you make a change which will stop your application from compiling. In these error cases the status server jumps in and starts listening on localhost:8000. The status server will then display the error message so you can quickly fix it:
                    </p>

                    <img src="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/releases/v07082020.png" alt="Example of a status server error message">

                    <p>
                        Additionally open browser tabs will be notified about this and will refresh. This way the error is instantly visible to you.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Batteries-included</strong>

                    <p>
                        While the above steps are technically complicated, when doing actual development you will not see much of this complexity.  Lots of time have been spent to find the best approach and smoothing out all the edge cases. The whole process is very much inspired by PHP where you just make file changes and it works. The live reloading really <q>just works</q>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The dev server is the heart of IHP and makes the dev process extremely productive. You get all the benefits of type-safety with the development speed you previously only got with scripting languages. If you haven't already it's time to try it out! 🚀
                    </p>

    <p>Today I finally write down some musings on two peripheral aspects of
compiler diagnostic design that I think are very important for certain kinds of warnings.
My first musing relates to <em>fixits</em>, and my second to <em>suppression mechanisms</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-fixit">What is a fixit?</h2>

<p>Most C++ compilers these days don’t just tell you <em>that</em> a problem occurred
(like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt"><code>ed</code>’s famous <code>?</code> prompt</a>),
and <em>what</em> the problem is (“expected identifier,” for example).
They’ll try to tell you <em>how to fix</em> the problem.</p>

<p>Compare GCC 4.1’s error messages with GCC 4.6’s. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/KM8P9E">Godbolt.</a>)
For this input:</p>



<p>GCC 4.1 complains merely that you have put <code>multiple types in one declaration</code>.
GCC 4.6 more helpfully complains that it <code>expected ';' after struct definition</code>,
and points to the exact position where it believes a semicolon should be inserted.</p>

<p>GCC 7 goes even further, and suggests a <em>fixit</em> — a machine-readable “spellcheck suggestion”
that some IDEs are able to apply with a single click.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>test.cc:1:12: error: expected ';' after struct definition
 struct S {}
            ^
            ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In medical terms, the compiler has gone from simply detecting the <em>symptom</em>
(“this declaration seems to contain two types, which isn’t valid C++”)
to producing a <em>diagnosis</em> of the disease (“I bet you forgot a semicolon somewhere”);
and a compiler that supports fixits is actually <em>prescribing a treatment plan</em>.
Each of these steps is a quantum leap beyond the previous one in terms of both user-friendliness
and implementation complexity.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-suppression-mechanism">What is a suppression mechanism?</h2>

<p>Suppression mechanisms relate to compiler <em>warnings</em>, not compiler errors.
Consider the following snippet (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/fTnao9">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (argc = 1)
    puts("hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every mainstream compiler warns on this suspicious-looking code (GCC and Clang with <code>-Wall</code>; MSVC with <code>-W4</code>).
Here’s GCC’s diagnostic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Wparentheses]
    4 |     if (argc = 1)
      |         ~~~~~^~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that GCC doesn’t even bother to explain really what its diagnosis is;
it emits a passive-aggressive warning message that does nothing more than suggest how to
shut itself up!</p>

<p>The diagnosis, of course, is that frequently people mean to write <code>if (argc == 1)</code>
but their finger slips and they write <code>if (argc = 1)</code> instead, which unfortunately
is also valid C++ code. Every mainstream compiler has evolved the same way to deal with this:
if you really mean <code>=</code>, then you write an extra pair of parentheses around the expression, like so:</p>



<p>The extra pair of parentheses is what I’m calling a “suppression mechanism.”
It’s just an arbitrary way of silencing a warning diagnostic — telling the compiler
“no, I really <em>meant</em> to write this legal but unusual construct.”</p>

<p>Another well-known suppression mechanism is writing <code>(void)</code> in front of unused results
to silence <code>-Wunused-value</code> and <code>-Wunused-result</code> warnings (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/WdrhrE">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[[nodiscard]] int foo();
void test(int x) {
    (void)x;
    (void)foo();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a trivial suppression mechanism is implied by the name of the <code>-Wparentheses</code> warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: '&amp;&amp;' within '||' [-Wlogical-op-parentheses]
    return (a &amp;&amp; b || c);
            ~~^~~~ ~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the compiler just wants you to add a pair of parentheses to clarify the precedence for the reader.</p>

<h2 id="musing-a-single-fixit-must-preserve-actual-behavior-or-likely-intent-but-cant-do-both">Musing: A single fixit must preserve (actual) behavior or (likely) intent, but can’t do both</h2>

<p>It’s easy for the programmer to “fix” diagnostics like <code>-Wunused-result</code> and <code>-Wlogical-op-parentheses</code>,
because they’re just asking the programmer to clarify intent that is already pretty clear:
<em>Yes</em>, I mean to discard this result. <em>Yes</em>, I mean to evaluate <code>(a &amp;&amp; b) || c</code>.</p>

<p>The more interesting diagnostics are the ones where the compiler believes it has identified a mismatch
between the code’s actual <em>behavior</em> and the programmer’s <em>intent</em>. Our <code>if (argc = 1)</code> example
above was like that. A more realistic example might be something like</p>



<p>Here it is almost certain that the programmer intended to write</p>



<p>However, the literal behavior of the code as written is equivalent to</p>



<p>When the compiler suggests a fixit for this warning, it has to choose: Should we suggest the fix
that changes the behavior of the code to what you probably meant to type — the “spellcheck” option?
Or should we show how to silence the warning while preserving the existing code’s behavior — the
“Add To Dictionary” option, if you will? (Or, continuing our medical analogy, there’s the “treatment”
option and the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate">DNR</a>” option.)</p>

<p>Showing just the “treatment” option puts the compiler in the awkward position of “recommending” that you change
the behavior of code that is, after all, perfectly legal C++ already; blindly applying the fixit to
working code might break that code. But showing just the “suppression” option might encourage a programmer to
blindly apply the fixit to <em>broken</em> code, thus leaving the bug in place but making it harder to detect
in the future.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of warnings, Clang shows <em>both</em> fixits. Two examples of this in Clang 10
are (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aWf9s6">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: using the result of an assignment as a condition without parentheses [-Wparentheses]
    if (x = foo())
        ~~^~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the assignment to silence this warning
    if (x = foo())
          ^
        (        )
note: use '==' to turn this assignment into an equality comparison
     if (x = foo())
          ^
          ==
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: &amp; has lower precedence than !=; != will be evaluated first [-Wparentheses]
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the '!=' expression to silence this warning
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
                    (        )
note: place parentheses around the &amp; expression to evaluate it first
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
            (           )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that in both cases, Clang decides to print the “suppression” option first
and the “treatment” option second.
But sometimes Clang prints the “treatment” option first and the “suppression” option second:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: size argument in 'strncmp' call is a comparison [-Wmemsize-comparison]
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ~~~~^~~
note: did you mean to compare the result of 'strncmp' instead?
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
           ^                    ~
                            )
note: explicitly cast the argument to size_t to silence this warning
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ^
                         (size_t)( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: logical not is only applied to the left hand side of this comparison [-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^  ~~
note: add parentheses after the '!' to evaluate the comparison first
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                      (     )
note: add parentheses around left hand side expression to silence this warning
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                     ( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there are many more cases where Clang emits <em>only</em> the “suppression” option
as a fixit, leaving the programmer to figure out the “treatment” on their own. (GCC 10.2
emits a fixit for only the last of these four examples; and it’s the “suppression” option.)</p>

<p>Even in the absence of any machine-readable fixits, the phrasing of the warning message
itself can induce the human reader to think in terms of suppression or in
terms of treatment. A warning message can be phrased as “Please confirm that you meant X”;
or “You did X; did you mean Y?”; or even as “Your attempt to do Y failed.”</p>

<h2 id="musing-suppression-mechanisms-are-about-edit-distance-and-about-signaling">Musing: Suppression mechanisms are about edit distance, and about signaling</h2>

<p>Compiler warnings of the kind we’re discussing here are basically of the form
“You wrote X, but I think you meant Y.” This happens only when X and Y are
in some sense <em>close together</em>. Sometimes the “closeness” is semantic, not syntactic
(as when the programmer means to invoke copy elision but writes <code>return std::move(x)</code> instead).
But for our purposes today, let’s just think about <em>syntactic</em> closeness. You meant
to write Y, but a minor typographical slip caused you to write X. In the examples above,
the slips are things like “omit one <code>=</code>,” or “omit a pair of parens” or
“put <code>&lt; 0</code> inside the parens instead of outside.”</p>

<p>Take X=”equality-compare <code>!a</code> to <code>b</code>” and Y=”negate the sense of <code>a == b</code>.”
There are some pieces of code that clearly intend to express X, such as <code>(!a)==(b)</code>.
There are some that clearly intend to express Y, such as <code>a != b</code>.
But you wrote <code>(!a==b)</code>, which falls into a gray area: it’s not clear which of
X and Y you really intended to express.</p>

<p>The job of the compiler-diagnostic-developer is to create some separation between
the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly X”
and the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly Y.”
Essentially, we create an error-correcting code by deliberately increasing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">edit distance</a>
between pairs of inequivalent C++ programs — deliberately increasing the number of keystrokes
the programmer would have to screw up in order to transform a working (and warning-free)
C++ program into an inequivalent broken (yet warning-free) C++ program.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in cases where Y is more commonly intended than X, it should be relatively <em>easier</em>
to write Y than X. In our example that’s true even at the core-language level: <code>a != b</code> is
already easier to write than <code>!a == b</code>. But when we increase the distance between X-space and Y-space,
we shrink X-space by more than we shrink Y-space. If you really intend to express <code>!a == b</code>, we’ll force you
to retreat all the way to <code>(!a) == b</code>. This is kind of analogous to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)">signaling principle</a>
in economics or evolutionary biology: Basically, if you want the compiler to accept your intent,
your code must adopt some cumbersome and frankly maladaptive ornamentation in order to <em>prove</em>
its worthiness to the compiler.</p>

<p>According to the prevailing theory of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">sexual selection in the animal kingdom</a>,
when a peahen is deciding whether to accept
a particular peacock, she uses …</p></div></div>

ESP32 is a series of dual-core up to 240Mhz, low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth/BLE.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/ac7ba2d12ae49bb808d323edae91463b7f97656872f7d24c91dab86d4ba1653d.jpeg"></p><p>Pwnagotchi is a tamagochi like device powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either through passive sniffing or by performing deauthentication and association attacks). This material is collected on disk as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including full and half WPA handshakes as well as PMKIDs. Or put quickly, it's a tamagochi who eats WiFi handshakes to be happy.</p><p>Hash Monster runs in a smaller size and cheaper platform superior to the Pwnagotchi in several aspects. While Pwnagotchi is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero and requires assembling a DIY kit with various components such as an eInk screen and an external powerbank, the Hash Monster works on directly on the tiny M5Stack device. M5 Stack couples an ESP32 with a small LCD display, buttons and internal battery. It’s a modular, stackable, scalable, and portable device which is powered with an ESP-32 core, which makes it open source, low cost, full-function, and easy for developers to handle ESP32 IoT product development. You can program M5Stack through Arduino, C++, Blockly or MicroPython to name a few. The complete development kit for M5 Stack just under $45 provides a friendly price and full-featured resources which makes it a good starter kit for you to explore ESP32. While the M5 Stack includes a built-in battery 110mAh, it can be upgraded with a stackable 700 mAh lipo battery extension module.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/615059260bcadb5085e71de543154bec6c52222f5d1efda91cdcafdbe403cce2.png"></p><p>The similarity between Pwnagotchi and Hash Monster is that they capture both PSK handshakes from WPA / WPA2 networks and PSK hashes contained in beacon frames with PMKID. A great advantage of PMKID cracking is that everything you need is available over the air even if there are no stations connected and only a single packet capture is required. Later we can crack these hashes with standard tools such as aircrack or hashcat, and thus obtain the credentials. Of course, we should only do this in networks that we manage ourselves or that we have permission to audit.</p><p><strong>The process.</strong></p><p>Hardware requirements:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3jFAnl8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">M5Stack CORE Development Kit</a> with built-in 110mAh Battery ($45)</li></ul><p>Optionally:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3gYtI48" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Extended Battery M5Stack Core Development Kit Capacity 700mAh Stackable Module</a> (USD$12)</li><li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/M5Stack-Multi-function-Digital-Watch-with-700mAh-Battery-for-M5Stack-ESP32-Core-p-1551727.html?rmmds=search&amp;cur_warehouse=CN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Smart Watch Module with 700mAh Battery for M5Stack ESP32 Core</a> ($15)</li></ul><p>The software installation is pretty straight forward:</p><p>1.Setup Arduino IDE environment.</p><p><em>M5Stack Arduino IDE Setup in 5 minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg</a></em></p><p>2.

We will do this with two known tools – Aircrack-ng and Hashcat, which relies respectively on CPU and GPU power. We will be running these tools from linux, even though they are both found in a Windows version as well. Remember to use recent versions to benefit from the PMKID attack in addition to the traditional cracking of handshakes.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/adb3724e47a02d9fe14b83454cae422f882a9c99ccc78f0f2db6ef6e7a7f6f9b.png"></p><p>Aircrack-ng can be used for very basic dictionary attacks running on your CPU. Before you run the attack you need a wordlist. I recommend using the infamous rockyou dictionary file:</p><p># download the 134MB rockyou dictionary file</p><pre><code><code>curl -L -o rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt</code></code></pre><p>Note, that if the network password is not in the wordlist you will not crack the password.</p><p># -a2 specifies WPA2, -b is the BSSID, -w is the wordfile</p><pre><code><code>aircrack-ng -a2 -b AC:FC:E3:C9:AB:C0 -w rockyou.txt 3.cap</code></code></pre><p>If the password is cracked you will see a KEY FOUND! message in the terminal followed by the plain text version of the network password.</p><p>Cracking an WiFi password using brute force attack for a long WiFi password without GPUs or Cloud help, will be a nightmare but if the password is short or you know the key pattern it will be "easily" cracked.</p><p>Here you have a small guide for linux (Ubuntu) to crack the WiFi password using the files stored on the SD_Card of the Purple Hash Monster using your computer.</p><p>First we need to install <strong>hashcat</strong></p><pre><code><code>sudo apt-get update</code><br>
<code> sudo apt install hashcat</code></code></pre><p>EAPOL/PMKID stored on the SD-Card are <em>pcap</em> files, we have to convert to <em>hccapx</em> format to work with hashcat. In terminal from the directory were we have the <em>pcap</em> file from the SD-CARD:</p><pre><code><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/master/src/cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> gcc -o cap2hccapx cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> ./cap2hccapx 1.pcap 1.hccapx</code></code></pre><p>For example if we know that the wifi password has a lenght of 8 digits we can run the following command, and in few seconds we will have the WiFi Password :)</p><pre><code><code>hashcat --force -m 2500 -a 3 -1 ?d -o cracked 1.hccapx ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1</code></code></pre><p><strong>Final notes</strong></p><p>Although in my case I exclusively use the M5 Stack for the pocket monster hash, there are undoubtedly several projects that run on the M5 Stack and you will certainly want to take a look if you are interested in wifi and bluetooth security attack tools for this platform.</p><p>M5 Stack WiFi SSID Scanner by Elkentaro</p><p><a href="https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector</a></p><p>Covid Sniffer: BLE COVID exposure app sniffer using M5 Stack</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer</a></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/02ee78aa44062073eb950642e19a44a548daf55d3217643f1a98cc84d37bc7d6.jpeg"></p></article></div>]]>

<p>Many people look at skyscrapers around the world and conclude they are unnecessarily tall. This blog post discusses the economics of skyscraper height. Contrary to popular belief, most skyscrapers have a strong economic rational. <a href="http://buildingtheskyline.org/skyscraper-height-i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read More »</a></p>

<p>What does it cost to build a skyscraper? The blog post reviews the economics of skyscraper supply. One of the reasons why we increasingly see supertalls in Asia is the because of cost of construction is so low there.&nbsp; So, what are the “costnomics” that generate building height? <a href="http://buildingtheskyline.org/skyscraper-height-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read More »</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-clipboard-async-api">2. 📋 Clipboard Async API</h2>
<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>
<p>Direct link to the demo: <a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/web-apis/web-apis-clipboard-apis/">https://demo.greenroots.info/web-apis/web-apis-clipboard-apis/</a></p>
<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-image-capture-api">4. 📷 Image Capture API</h2>
<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717833234/MPOxVZ92M.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="chrome_Umvi16wUlu.png"></p>
<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-broadcast-channel-api">5. 📡 Broadcast Channel API</h2>
<p>The <code>Broadcast Channel API</code> allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the <strong>same origin</strong>. Think of a use-case like, once you logout from an app running in a browser tab, you want to broadcast it to the app instances opened in other tabs of the same browser.</p>

        <p>With this year’s <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020">International Conference on Machine Learning&nbsp;(ICML)</a>
being over, it is time to have another instalment of this series.
Similar to <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/icml_tda_roundup/">last year’s post</a>, I shall cover
several papers that caught my attention because of their use of
topological concepts—however, <em>unlike</em> last year, I shall not
restrict the selection to papers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis&nbsp;(TDA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector:</strong> I might have missed some promising papers. Any
suggestions for additions are more than welcome! Please reach out

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04881">Learning Flat Latent Manifolds with VAEs</a>
by <a href="https://argmax.ai/team/nutan-chen">Nutan Chen</a>, <a href="https://www.argmax.ai/team/alexej-klushyn">Alexej Klushyn</a>,
Francesco Ferroni, <a href="http://bayerj.github.io/">Justin Bayer</a>, and
<a href="https://argmax.ai/team/patrick-van-der-smagt">Patrick van der Smagt</a>
discusses an interesting modification of variational autoencoders, viz.
an extended loss term that regularises the latent space to be
<em>flat</em>&nbsp;(i.e. having no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature</a>).
The main idea is to ensure that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor">Riemannian metric tensor</a>
is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>The ingenious implication of such a latent space is that the Euclidean
distance is a good proxy for the similarity between data points, whereas
this is <em>not</em> a priori the case for other latent spaces. It is interesting
to note that there is a ‘sibling’ paper to this one, which was published
at ICLR 2020, namely <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1g6xeSKDS">Mixed-curvature Variational Autoencoders</a>.
This paper presents an autoencoder whose latent space is a product of
Riemannian manifolds, whose curvature is either fixed or learnable.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that curvature is starting to attract more attention
from the machine learning community. It is such a fundamental property
of a manifold but can influence the validity of many calculations in
latent spaces. It also has some beneficial properties for <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BylEqnVFDB">graph
classification</a>, but this is
maybe a better topic for a subsequent post!</p>

<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> is arguably<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the first step
towards properly integrating topological features into neural networks
for graph classification! Briefly put, we developed a homological
<code>READOUT</code> function&nbsp;(to use the parlance of graph neural networks)
that gives rise to a learnable filter function—a <em>filtration</em>.</p>
<p>This concept might be unknown to some readers, but a filtration in this
context is a scalar-valued function on the vertices of a graph that
permits <em>sorting</em> it. Filtrations serve as the backbone for many
topology-based algorithms, primarily for the aforementioned <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>,
which permits us to study multi-scale topological
features&nbsp;(connected components, cycles, etc.) of an object.
Prior to this paper, filtrations were pre-defined or chosen based on
some target function, such as the vertex degree function of a graph. Our
approach changes this—leading to a filtration that is learnable in an
end-to-end fashion and thus specifically designed for a classification
problem.</p>
<p>We manage to achieve this by first initialising our filter function
based on a regular graph neural network; essentially, one level of
message passing between nodes is sufficient. This provides us with
a non-trivial filter function whose performance we can subsequently
adjust by calculating the topological features induced by said filter,
and vectorising the resulting representations. Since each of these steps
is differentiable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the resulting function is also differentiable,
making it possible to adjust the filter for the best classification
results.</p>
<p>I would recommend this paper to anyone who is interested in learning
more about the benefits that a topology-based perspective brings to
certain application problems. Being able to learn the <em>right</em> topological features
to classify a set of graphs opens up exciting opportunities.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04805">Topologically Densified Distributions</a>
by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> studies regularisation properties of
over-parametrised neural networks in the context of small sample-size learning.
This is achieved by studying the properties of latent
representations&nbsp;(the paper uses the term <em>internal representation</em>,
but this is equivalent). More precisely, generalisation properties are
analysed via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure">push-forward probability measure</a>
induced by the latent representation&nbsp;(or <em>encoding</em>).</p>
<p>The authors show that probability mass concentration around training
samples in the latent space is linked to the generalisation capabilities
of a model, but, even more exciting, such a concentration can be achieved by applying
topological constraints on samples from that space! In the context of
this paper, such constraints pertain to measuring the <em>connectivity</em> of
samples. This is achieved using <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>, specifically,
by calculating a zero-dimensional Vietoris–Rips complex—if you are
not familiar with this term, just think of a minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>What I particularly enjoyed about this paper is that it starts providing
solid answers to fundamental concepts in machine learning. All too often,
we remain in the realm of the empirical and just <em>observe</em> whether our
network generalises. This paper ventures into hitherto-unknown territories
and gives us a theoretical justification!</p>

<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>, and
<a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Karsten Borgwardt</a> deals with
regularising the latent space in terms of its topology. More precisely,
we preserve the topological features of the input data in the respective
latent space&nbsp;(on the batch level, respectively). While we restrict
our experiments to connected components for now&nbsp;(so no cycles
yet, even though our method generalises to higher dimensions),
our approach makes it possible to create latent representations
that ‘mimic’ the topological features of the input.</p>
<p>This leads to a nice plug-and-play loss term that can be easily
integrated into most architectures, and we can demonstrate that, among
others, it considerably improves the quality of a ‘vanilla’ autoencoder
architecture. To achieve this goal, we had to solve all kinds of
interesting adventures, one of them being how to make everything
differentiable. Interestingly, we end up with a similar necessary
condition for differentiability than for the graph filtration learning
paper, viz. the pairwise distances between different samples of the
input batch need to be <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>The coolest feature of our method is that it technically <em>only</em> requires
a distance metric between input samples<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, nothing more—no feature
vector representation or anything. It can thus conceivably be used to
represent the topology of any object you fancy&nbsp;(including
documents, images, and graphs).</p>

present a novel method for calculating normalising flows on more complex
spaces than the usual Euclidean ones. Specifically, as the title
implies, they develop methods for calculating such flows on tori and
spheres.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed about this paper is the smart way of constructing flows
iteratively: first, flows on the circle are being constructed&nbsp;(using
different concepts for defining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a>, the most favourite of
mine being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation">Möbius transformation</a>).
Since a torus can be described as the Cartesian product of circles, this
is sufficient to describe flows on tori of arbitrary dimensions! Next,
the flows are generalised to higher-dimensional spheres.</p>
<p>While I am by no means and expert in normalising flows, I liked
reading this paper a lot. The theory is well-developed and it is another
one of those publications that shows you how to go beyond the boundaries
of what is currently possible. Moreover, I enjoyed the discussion of the
implementation details—it turns out that achieving numerical stability
here is another feat that deserves some mention!</p>

<p>This year’s ICML also featured an interesting array of topology-based
papers. Not all of them fit neatly into the field of topological data
analysis&nbsp;(TDA), but I am happy to see that the community is
starting to pick up this fundamental topic. I remain convinced that
a topology-driven perspective is needed to answer certain foundational
questions in machine learning. Here’s to the future of topology!</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

    <div>
          <div><p>NeoAxis company releases a new version of NeoAxis Engine, an integrated development environment with built-in 3D and 2D game engine. The environment can be used to develop all kinds of 3D and 2D projects such as computer games, visual trainers, VR systems, to visualize processes and develop windowed applications.</p>
<p>In this release, the engine has been translated to .NET Core 3.1 from .NET Framework, has been added support for Visual Studio Code, Rider and other C# IDEs, the editor has been improved and optimized, in the launcher you can now create Window App projects, also examples of creating add-ons have been added to the Assets\Samples\Addons folder.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neoaxis.com/images/2020_5/NeoAxis_2020_5_ScifiDemo.png"><img src="https://www.neoaxis.com/images/2020_5/NeoAxis_2020_5_ScifiDemo.jpg" alt="" width="900"></a></p>
<h2>.NET Core 3.1</h2>
<p>In this release, the engine was upgraded to .NET Core 3.1, previously .NET Framework 4.6 was used. This gave a performance improvement. The engine and editor are noticeably faster. Now the created application does not require .NET installation, it is included into the project. It is also now easy to update the project to newer versions of .NET such as .NET 5.</p>
<h2>Support for Visual Studio Code, Rider and other C# IDEs</h2>
<p>Project compilation is now supported using any IDE that supports C# and .NET Core 3.1.</p>
<h2>Window app creation</h2>
<p>The ability to create windowed applications has been improved. When creating a new project, you can choose a Window App template, with which you can set the initial settings. The engine includes its own GUI system and GUI designer. This allows you to create full-fledged windowed applications, however, creating of windowed applications is still a new feature of NeoAxis.</p>

        Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm,
        providing high compression ratios.
        It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off,
        while being backed by a very fast decoder (see <a href="#benchmarks">benchmarks</a> below).
        It also offers a special mode for small data, called <a href="#small-data">dictionary compression</a>,
        and can create dictionaries from any sample set.
        Zstandard library is provided as open source software using a BSD license.

  <p>
    Tracking position of something is a topic that I like, cause it makes me
    feel like to be a human with a sixth sense. With this sense I know where an
    object is and how it moves, in spite of&nbsp; I can't see the object
    directly with my naked eyes. Then how do we get a sixth sense? Because as
    ordinary human we only have five senses.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, living in this digital age today, we already had a sixth
    sense which is called technology that implemented in an application. Related
    with our topic in this post about flight tracking, there are numerous flight
    tracking applications out there such as flightradar24, FlightAware,
    flightview and so on, which enabled us to monitor position of airplanes
    around the earth. This post won't discuss about those applications, moreover
    I will discuss how to make our own flight tracking application with
    python.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously I already posted two tutorials about flight tracking with python.
    The first one is about
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2018/11/create-simple-live-flight-tracking-python.html">creating a simple flight tracking application with python</a>
    and the another one is
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2019/01/realtime-flight-tracking-pandas-bokeh-python.html">creating a flight tracking application with pandas and bokeh</a>. What is the difference with this one? The main difference is data source.
    In those two previous posts, I used
    <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADS-B Exchange</a>
    and in this tutorial I'm using
    <a href="https://opensky-network.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Opensky Network</a>. Another difference is module version. In this tutorial I'm using the
    latest version python library in particular for plotting library. So there
    will be a slight change in the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enough for introduction. Now let's move to our main topic how to build a
    flight tracking application with python using open air traffic data. This
    tutorial consists of several sub-topics, there are: Getting data, importing
    required libraries, loading basemap, plotting aircraft's position and make a
    "realtime" flight tracking application. We will discuss each part, and at
    the end of this tutorial we will get a flight tracking application which is
    running in a browser as shown in figure 1.

</div><h3>Getting Air Traffic Data

<ins data-ad-client="ca-pub-5632482621101280" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-slot="7655392618"></ins>
</h3>
<p>
  As I mentioned earlier, in this tutorial we are using open air traffic data
  from OpenSky Network. OpenSky Network is an non-profit consortium that
  provides open air traffic data to the public in particular for research and
  non-commercial purposes. The data can be accessed through REST API, Python API
  and Java API. In this tutorial we will use REST API to retrieve the live air
  traffic data.
</p>
<p>
  To retrieve the data using REST API can be done using request operation. There
  are two types of requests can be used. The first one is request for specific
  airplane based on time in UNIX timestamp or ICAO24 address. The second one we
  can get all airplane data within an area extent using WGS84 coordinates
  system. Moreover the access for the data can be done anonymously or registered
  user. For anonymously request, it has 10 seconds resolution and 5 seconds for
  registered user. <br>
</p>
<p>
  In this tutorial we will use the second one. We will define an area extent
  with minimum and maximum coordinates, and then send the query to get all
  airplane data within the area. For example we want to fetch the data over United States
  with minimum coordinate -125.974,30.038 and maximum coordinate -68.748,52.214. The query for both anonymously and registered user will be as follow.
</p>
<pre><span>#</span>Anonymously Request
https:<span>//</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=-68.748</span><span></span>

<span>#</span>Registered User Request
https:<span>//</span>username:password<span>@</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=</span><span>30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=</span><span>-68.748</span><span></span></pre>
<p>
  Before continuing reading and to make sure the query is right, let's try it.
  Copy the anonymously query and paste into a browser. If you get a response
  like figure 2 below, then it works.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  The return response as shown in figure 2 is in JSON structure with two keys.
  The first one is <i>time </i>and the second one is <i>States</i> that contains
  data for each airplane in a list array. The list array stores many data such
  as: ICAO24 address, airplane call sign, origin country, time position, last
  contact, longitude, latitude, barometer altitude and so on. For complete
  explanation about the data response and also further information about OpenSky
  Network API please refer to
  <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2020/08/OpenSky%20Network%20API" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenSky Network API Documentation</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Getting Air Traffic Data in Python</h3>

<p>
  We already retrieved the traffic data using REST API in a browser. Now let's
  do it in Python and process the response for the next purpose. For this
  tutorial I'm using Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 and some libraries such
  as Bokeh 2.1.1, Pandas 0.25.3, requests, json and numpy. <br>
</p>
<p>
  Below is the code to make a request and do a little processing on the
  data. At the beginning, we import the required libraries such as requests,
  json and Pandas. Then define the extent coordinate in WGS84 with respective
  variable <i>lon_min,lat_min, lon_max and lat_max</i>.&nbsp; Based on the
  extent coordinate, make the request query. If you are a registered user, give
  the user name and password in <i>user_name</i> and <i>password</i> variable at
  line 11-12. Based on given extent coordinate and user data, we create a
  request query in <i>url_data</i> variable as in line 13 and get the response
  in json format. The remain of the code is used to dump the response data into
  Pandas data frame and replace the blank/empty data with 'NaN' value with 'No
  Data'. The last line which is data frame's <i>head</i> method is used to view
  the first 5 top row of the data as shown in figure 3. &nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p>Make sure after executing the code, you have a result as in figure 3. If you
  get it, it means everything is fine, and we have the data that will be used
  for the next step.</p><h3>Plotting Airplane on the Map</h3>
<p>
  After getting the data, now let's plot the location of all airplanes on a
  map.&nbsp; For plotting purpose, we are using Bokeh library. Therefore we need
  to import the library first. Additionally we also need to import NumPy library
  that will be used in coordinate conversion.
</p>
<p>
  The conversion of coordinate system is implemented in a function which is
  called <i>wgs84_web_mercator</i>_. As it's name this function will be used to
  transform WGS84 coordinate into web Mercator coordinate system. This
  transformation is required because we are using a
  <i>STAMEN_TERRAIN</i> basemap in a web browser that has web Mercator
  projection (EPSG: 3857).
</p>
<p>
  After creating coordinate conversion function and perform the transformation
  for data frame and extent coordinates. Next we set up plotting figure settings
  by specifying plotting area extent based on the range of x and y coordinates.
  The aircraft will be plotted on the basemap based on x and y coordinates with
  Points and also with airplane icon image. Why both point and image are used to plot
  the aircraft? Image will give a better visualization by using an airplane
  image and it can be rotated with the respective track angle. But unfortunately it
  can't&nbsp; high light a selected object and display more information with
  hover tool. To overcome this issue we use both image and point in circle
  object to get nice a visualization and enable selection and hovering tool.
  &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>
  The following is the code until this step. If it is
  executed we will get a result as in figure 4.&nbsp; <br>

          <p><h2><span>Overall Thoughts</span></h2></p> <p><span>48 Laws of Power is a collection of tactics for attaining power in various domains in life. It may come off as amoral, and some of the tricks outlined in the book are shady to say the least. It is a tough pill to swallow. But it is an informative and engaging book, if you read it without value judgement. Less of a wholesome guide on how to live life, more of a disappassionate analysis of ways to obtain power. And here's the way the author Robert Greene himself puts it: "I'm not evil. I'm a realist."</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Summary</span></h2></p> <p><span>Below is the the list of the 48 laws detailed in the book, along with any important notes.</span></p> <p><h3><span>Law 1: Never outshine the master</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are</strong> <span> and you will attain the heights of power.</span></p> <p><span>As you try to impress your masters, do not go too far in displaying your talents. Otherwise, you will inspire fear and insecurity.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 2: Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies</span></h3></p> <p><span>Be wary of friends. </span> <strong>You have more to fear from friends than from enemies</strong> <span>. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.</span></p> <p><span>Friends will betray you more quickly, as envy makes things tricky. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 3: Conceal your intentions</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Keep people off-balance and in the dark.</strong> <span> Never reveal the purpose behind your actions. </span></p> <p><span>Hide your intentions not by closing up but&nbsp;</span> <strong>by talking endlessly about your desires and goals (just not your real ones)</strong> <span>. These are smoke screens that can disguise your actions.</span></p> <p><span>If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 4: Always say less than necessary</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The more you say, the more common you appear</strong> <span>, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike.</span></p> <p><span>You can't take back words once they are out. Keep them under control. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 5: So much depends on reputation. Guard it with your life</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win</strong> <span>. It is the foundation of power.</span></p> <p><span>Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, </span> <strong>learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations</strong> <span>. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them. Doubt is a powerful weapon.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 6: Court attention at all cost</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost</strong> <span>. It is better to be attacked than be ignored, for what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd or buried in oblivion. Attach your name and reputation to an image larger, more colorful, and mysterious than other people.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 7: Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Use other people to further your own cause</strong> <span>. It saves you valuable time and resources. Never do yourself what others can do for you. Your helpers wil lbe forgotten, and you will be remembered. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 8: Make other people come to you. Use bait if necessary</span></h3></p> <p><span>It is always wise to </span> <strong>make your opponent come to you</strong> <span>, and have them abandon their own plans in the process. Fight the battle on your turf. When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. Lure them into your territory with a potential victory, then attack. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 9: Win through your actions, never through an argument</span></h3></p> <p><span>Any short-lived victory you think you gain through argument is an illusion, as resentment builds up. It is more powerful to get other people to agree with you through your actions, instead of your words. </span></p> <p><span>Show, don't tell. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 10: Infection: Avoid the unhappy and unlucky</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves.</strong> <span> They will also draw it on you. Don't try to help an infector, or you will pay the price. Helping the drowning man only sets you up for a disaster. You can die from someone else’s misery.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 11: Learn to keep people dependent on you</span></h3></p> <p><span>Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity. Teach a man how to&nbsp;fish&nbsp;and you feed him for his life time. Don't. To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim</span></h3></p> <p><strong>One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones</strong> <span>. Even the most suspicious people can be disarmed with gestures of generosity and honesty. Once they let their guard down, you can manipulate them at will.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 14: Pose as a friend, work as a spy</span></h3></p> <p><span>Know your enemies. Learn to probe for other people's weaknesses and intentions. Every occasion is an opoprtunity to spy. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 15: Crush your enemy totally</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 16: Use absence to increase respect and honor</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear</strong> <span>. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 17: Keep others in suspended terror: Cultivate an air of unpredictability</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Be deliberately unpredictable</strong> <span>. Patterns are powerful, and you can keep others off-balance by disrupting the predictability. They will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 18: Do not build fortresses to protect yourself. Isolation is dangerous</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 19: Know who you’re dealing with. Do not offend the wrong person</span></h3></p> <p><span>Not everyone will react to your actions the same way. There are so many different kinds of people after all. Pick your battles, choose your rivals carefully.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 20: Do not commit to anyone</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 21: Play a sucker to catch a sucker. Seem dumber than your mark</span></h3></p> <p><span>Make your victims feel smart. Make them feel smarter than you are. Once they believe this is true, they will not be able to detect your ulterior motives.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 22: Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Surrender first</strong> <span>. Turn the other cheek.  Resist the temptation to fight back for honor's sake. That will throw off the aggressor.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 23: Concentrate your forces</span></h3></p> <p><span>Focus. Intensity is the name of the game. Don't spread your energy too thin.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 24: Play the perfect courtier
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Practice flattery and nonchalance. Yield to those who are more powerful. Assert power over others in the most graceful manner. Master your emotions. Never be the bearer of bad news.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 25: Recreate yourself
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Take control over your own image, or others will. Forge a new identity that commands attention. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 26: Keep your hands clean
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Hide your mistakes, or use a scapegoat to conceal your involvement. You must maintain a flawless appearance.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 27: Play on people’s need to believe to create a cultlike following
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Keep it vague, but full of promise. Promote passion over rationality. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 28: Enter action with boldness
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Timidity is dangerous</strong> <span>. People admire the bold.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 29: Plan all the way to the end
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 30: Make your accomplishments seem effortless
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Act effortlessly, as if you could do much more</strong> <span>. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 31: Control the options. Get others to play with the cards you deal
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Rig the game. Change the playing field in your favour. Your opponents will get a false sense of control, but you will come out on top regardless of which option they choose.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 32: Play to people’s fantasies
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Life is tough. People want to believe there is something or someone to blame. Give them what they want.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 33: Discover each man’s thumbscrew
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall</strong> <span>. Once you find it, you can turn it to your advantage. What other people can't control, you control for them.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 34: Be royal in your own fashion: Act like a king to be treated like one
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 35: Master the art of timing
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Always appear patient and in control. You never want to be seen to be in a hurry. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 36: Disdain things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best revenge
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 37: Create compelling spectacles
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Create spectacles for the people around you. This creates the aura of power around you.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 38: Think as you like but behave like others
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 39: Stir up waters to catch fish
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Never be angry or emotionally stirred, for they are counter-productive. However, if you can make your rivals angry while remaining calm yourself, it is a huge advantage. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 40: Despise the free lunch
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Pay the full price, as there is no cutting corners with excellence.</strong></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 41: Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Getting lost in a great man's shadow is a dangerous trap. Build a name for yourself, on your terms. Tread your own path.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 42: Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Trouble can usually be traced to a single source. If you let them be, they will infect the group with their ill will. Get rid of them before giving them the chance to do so.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 43: Work on the hearts and minds of others
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Play on what people fear, and dropping their guards by playing on what they hold dear. Don't coerce. Go along with what others' emotions.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 44: Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect
</span></h3></p> <p><span>The mirror effect: </span> <strong>By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values</strong> <span>. This is powerful, and few can resist it.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 45: Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 46: Never appear too perfect
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Envy is dangerous. One way to to eliminate envy is to </span> <strong>appear human and relatable</strong> <span>. It is wise to appear vulnerable and admit to defects occasionally.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 47: Do not go past the mark you aimed for. In victory, learn when to stop
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Leave on a high note. Don't let hubris blind you and trap you into pushing past what you had aimed for. When you reach a goal, stop. "Stop gain" is just as important as "stop loss".</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 48: Assume formlessness
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>By taking a shape, you open yourself to attack</strong> <span>. Instead, remain adaptable, remain on your toes. Accept that change is the only constant. Be like water. </span></p>

				<div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Why do transit-infrastructure projects in New York cost 20 times more on a per kilometer basis than in Seoul? W</span><span>e investigate this question across hundreds of transit projects from around the world. We have created a database that spans more than 50 countries and totals more than 11,000 km of urban rail built since the late 1990s. We will also examine this question in greater detail by carrying out six in-depth case studies that take a closer look at unique considerations and variables that aren’t easily quantified, like project management, governance, and site conditions.</span></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to figure out how to deliver more high-capacity transit projects for a fraction of the cost in countries like the United States. Additionally, we hope that our site will be a useful resource for elected officials, planners, researchers, journalists, advocates, and others interested in contextualizing transit-infrastructure costs and fighting for better projects.</p>
<p><span>If you have ideas and evidence about why transit costs vary so greatly from one country to the next or you just want to connect with us, please get in touch at info@transitcosts.com or click on the “Contact Us” tab. We are always looking for new projects, data, corrections, resources, and feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are a group of researchers under the umbrella of the NYU Marron Institute of Urban Management, but our team is spread across the globe.</span></p>

              <p>Maintainable and readable test code is crucial to establish a good test coverage which in turn enables implementing new features and performing refactorings without the fear of breaking something. This post contains many best practices that I collected over the years of writing unit tests and integration tests in Java. It involves modern technologies like JUnit5, AssertJ, Testcontainers, and Kotlin. Some recommendations might be obvious to you, but some might conflict with what you’ve read in books about software development and testing.</p>

              </p>
              

              
              

<ul>
<li><strong>Write small and specific tests</strong> by heavily using helper functions, parameterized tests, AssertJ’s powerful assertions, not overusing variables, asserting only what’s relevant and avoiding one test for all corner cases.</li>
<li><strong>Write self-contained tests</strong> by revealing all relevant parameters, insert data right in the test and prefer composition over inheritance.</li>
<li><strong>Write dumb tests</strong> by avoiding the reuse of production code and focusing on comparing output values with hard-coded values.</li>
<li><strong>KISS &gt; DRY</strong></li>
<li><strong>Test close to production</strong> by focusing on testing a complete vertical slide and avoiding in-memory databases.</li>
<li>JUnit5 and AssertJ are a very good choice.</li>
<li>Invest in a testable implementation by avoiding static access, using constructor injection, using <code>Clocks</code> and separating business logic from asynchronous execution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="given-when-then">Given, When, Then</h2>
<p>A test should contain three blocks which are separated by one empty line. Each block of code should be as short as possible. Use subfunctions to shorten these blocks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given (Input): Test preparation like creating data or configure mocks</li>
<li>When (Action): Call the method or action that you like to test</li>
<li>Then (Output): Execute assertions to verify the correct output or behavior of the action.</li>

<li>Use helper functions for creating data (objects) (<code>createProductWithCategory()</code>) and complex assertions. Only pass those parameters to the helper functions that are relevant for your tests. Use reasonable defaults for the other values. In Kotlin, this is easy by using default arguments. In Java, you have to use method chaining and overloading to simulate default arguments.</li>
<li>varargs can make your test code even more concise (<code>ìnsertIntoDatabase()</code>).</li>
<li>Helper functions can also be used to create simple values more easily. This is even nicer in Kotlin where you can use extension functions for this.</li>

The design is not as long as an Airbus A350, but it has the same wing span. This allows the Flying-V to use the present infrastructure at airports, such as gates and runways. The Flying-V carries about the same number of passengers -&nbsp; 314 in the standard configuration – and the same amount of cargo, 160 m<sup>3</sup>. Project leader at TU Delft, Dr. Roelof Vos: “The Flying-V is smaller than the A350 and has less inflow surface area compared to the available amount of volume. The result is less resistance. That means the Flying-V needs less fuel for the same distance.”</p></div><div id="c463506"><div data-namespace-typo3-fluid="true">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In recent months, I've noticed a dramatic increase in TypeScript packages on GitHub. I usually come across them when checking repositories of the people I follow like. Or, when I'm looking for dependencies to solve a problem in my projects. And the more TypeScript packages I'm encountering, the more often I get reminded of this little annoyance towards the project.</p>
<p>My context is that I've not looked into TypeScript yet. That means I have no idea how it works. Unfortunately, this is now starting to become kind of a problem when searching for dependencies. It does, when I either willingly or accidentally include a TypeScript package into my projects. Mainly because my package-choosing criteria include:</p>
<ul>
<li>picking packages that I potentially can contribute to (e.g., a lesser-known package that contains well-written code); or</li>
<li>picking packages that are well-maintained by a large community but may include code that I'd not be able to easily contribute to (e.g., a popular package using a C library internally)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've put these criteria in place willingly to achieve a certain quality standard when building applications. Either because I can fix bugs myself quickly, or because I'm able to rely on a strong community to fix them. However, with TypeScript packages in npm, there's now this opaque problem of not knowing the language or quickly telling a package's language and its community size. Also, TypeScript could be just another CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>So essentially, the problem is that TypeScript authors publish their packages on npm, the package manager for Node.js. And to me, that's what is weakening the JavaScript ecosystem. Since its inception, and throughout trends like Coffeescript, npm has mostly held the promise of only hosting JavaScript packages. However, this promise is <code>rejected()</code> (lol) by many authors publishing their TypeScript-to-JavaScript transpiled packages.</p>
<p>Indeed, it makes sense considering that Microsoft markets TypeScript as a "superset of JavaScript" and since it "compiles" to JavaScript, why not publish packages to npm? But in terms of equality and identity, TypeScript is not JavaScript. After all, you'd not consider C and Objective-C the same either, or would you? In both examples, the languages are subsets/supersets but were conceived with different goals in mind to solve other problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, TypeScript authors should, in my opinion, do something along the following lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>namespacing their TypeScript packages; or</li>
<li>build and publish their packages to their package manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, continuing to publish TypeScript packages to npm is, in my opinion weakening the JavaScript ecosystem as it's splitting its community and polluting the npm namespace.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>
<ul>
<li>For a short time, there was an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24344506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense conversation</a> on Hacker News. But for unknown reasons, my post got marked as <code>[flagged]</code>. I've written an email to the operators.</li>
</ul>

Well, the first answer is that you build a gaming PC. That was a good project with a lot of incentives to complete, but that also meant it was soon over.  So, what next? I spotted a post about an outreach project from CERN to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ozel/DIY_particle_detector" target="_blank">build your own particle detector</a> for under £30. Sounded like fun, so here’s how we got on.</p>



<p>Firstly, a bit about ourselves: I’ve just retired from an IT architecture role at a major UK bank, a brave decision when you still have a child at secondary school and there’s a global pandemic looming. My son, Sam, has just completed his GCSEs and is about to enter the sixth form.  I have a degree in Physics and Sam has a keen interest in scientific things. We both suffer from hypermobility of the finger joints, meaning that we have limited fine motor skills (translation: we are both klutzes. Even klutzes can successfully build this detector.) I haven’t picked up a soldering iron in anger for a long time and Sam has only done two or three connections for a school project so we are effectively total noobs to this sort of project.</p>



<p>Anyway, here is a write-up of our experience and lessons learned rfom building the electron detector. If you’re planning on building one yourself then you may find this useful</p>



<h2>Buying the components</h2>



<p>The great thing about the CERN kit is that you can order most of the parts easily using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/ozel/diy_particle_detector/electron-detector/" target="_blank">kitspace</a>. Can you really build it for under €30 (about £27) as claimed? Well, yes and no. The exchange rates have all moved, which doesn’t help. The individual components certainly cost less than €30 but you cannot just buy individual components. You have to buy 10 resistors at a time but they are dirt cheap and you’ll just end up spending 30p instead of 3p for the parts you need. The biggest surprise was that you have to buy a minimum of three circuit boards, but this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It’s handy to have a spare board if your soldering skills are questionable, plus the alpha detector variant uses the same board so you have an incentive to build that model too. All-in-all, the cost of all the electronic components same to just under £40. If you were buying for a class project – a dozen or so boards – I think the bulk  price would be closer to £33/€37 per board.</p>



<p>There are some optional costs too that you may want to take into account. We bought a BNC to audio jack cable for about £8 on Amazon as this was quicker, easier and ultimately cheaper than building one from scratch. We also had to buy some tools that we needed but didn’t have in our existing toolbox. You may prefer to buy a metal case or project box for around £6, however I would recommend using an old sweet tin or similar. We used a presentation case off a Fossil watch that my wife received one Christmas.  To mount the board in the case, you’ll need some sort of metal standoff. We bought a box of M3 brass standoffs of assorted lengths with all the necessary screws and bolts for about £11 on Amazon. (120 components when you need only one!) You’ll also need some small lengths of connecting wire – about 30cm in total. (Tip: Amazon Prime is well worth the cost if you need to order all these things as you go along.)</p>



<p>Finally, you are going to need some sort of radioactive source to try out the detector. We bought 100g of analytical quality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potassium chloride</a> (KCl) on Amazon for under £5. This is a better price than that of the potassium-rich salt substitutes that are also on Amazon and has a higher proportion of potassium to boot.</p>



<h2>Tools that you’ll need</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1536" src="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949.jpeg 2048w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure>



<p>Before you start, make sure that you have all the tools that you’re going to need, Here’s a list of what we found necessary:</p>



<ul><li>A soldering iron with a small tip suitable for the components and board</li><li>A de-soldering pump and braid for when you mess things up</li><li>Small cutting pliers for tidying up excess wires when you’ve soldered a component</li><li>Wire strippers for the ends of the connecting wires</li><li>A small multi-meter for testing joints and checking the board</li><li>A nail punch to make holes in your old tin box</li><li>A file to file down the sharp edges on the holes that you’ve just punched</li><li>Some things to hold the board and components in position while you solder them. We used an old wall tile and a hexagonal pencil.</li></ul>



<h2>Constructing the detector</h2>



<p>We spent about three elapsed hours over about 3 weeks building the board and maybe another hour building the case and mounting the board into it. Why so long? Well, this project didn’t have the same appeal to a 16 year old as does building a gaming PC. Plus, use of said gaming PC frequently took priority over this project. We decided to solder the components in groups, doing the resistors first, then the capacitors then the semiconductors. The build instructions in the wiki are pretty good and easy to follow. </p>



<p>We tested every joint as we soldered it, making sure to test from another point on the circuit board so as to prove the connection was good. My son did all the soldering on one of the PCBs. I started work on a second board partly as a backup and partly to have something that could form the basis of the alpha detector. (I discovered the hard way that the two variants begin to differ at the third component, R3!)</p>



<p>Here are some shots of the board at different stages of construction:</p>

<h3>Stage 4</h3>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1536" src="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0948.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0948.jpeg 2048w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0948-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0948-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0948-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"><figcaption>The completed detector in its case with switch, battery and connector</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Testing the detector</h2>



<p>The first thing to do when testing the detector was to make sure that there were no shorts by measuring resistance across the power connectors. (Tick! A satisfactory 9.8 kilo-ohms) and make sure that power was reaching the board. Then we plugged it into a PC and switched it on. We were using the pulse detector JavaScript to check that it was working. I flicked the switch and…nothing. So, we examined the board. We knew we were novice constructors and some of the joints looked potentially to be dry and on one or two others we could not be 100% sure that we had an air gap between adjacent joints so we de-soldered and remade about 3 joints. Again we connected to the PC and we saw the satisfying pulses when the device was turned on and off. We also saw quite a bit of microphony being picked up when the tin was moved or when one of us spoke near it.</p>



<p>Ok, so next step was to try it with a radiation source. I weighed out roughly 10g of KCl into a plastic lid and positioned it under the diodes in the detector. We hadn’t made a radiation window in the lid of the tin and the diodes were about 1.5cm above the surface of the KCl. I switched on the detector and…nothing, not even the on/off pulses. The detector seemed dead.  I took the device apart and retested very connection with the multi-meter and made sure all the case connections were good and that the case was properly wired to earth. I checked that power from the battery was reaching all the necessary parts and that the battery power was good. I could find nothing wrong. </p>



<p>It quickly became apparent that there was an intermittent problem. Sometimes, the JavaScript detector would see a pulse when the device was switched on or off and sometimes – usually – there was nothing. Sometimes you would see noise on the web oscilloscope and sometimes not. I was scratching my head as to what the problem was. Eventually, it occurred to me to try actually listening to the audio output, a trivial thing to do under Windows. BINGO! I could hear white noise when the device was switched on and, just audible over the noise, a soft click every 20-30 seconds. Clearly the detector was working and therefore what I was facing was a software problem.</p>



<h2>The importance of sound cards, and repurposing yet again an ancient laptop</h2>



<p>I have to say that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ozel" target="_blank">Oliver Keller</a> was an enormous help while I was trying to get the detector working and I cannot stress enough how important it is to listen to his advice about audio connections and sound cards. The problem seems to be that sound cards (or chips) in modern PCs are too clever for their own good. They are designed to optimise microphone input for Skype and Zoom and that means removing the noise and extraneous clicks that are exactly the signal that the detector puts out. </p>



<p>Modern technology was assuming the detector signal was unwanted noise so I needed some primitive technology. I have an old notebook laptop, an Asus EeePC 901. I bought this about 10 years ago and it has been the subject of several hobbyist projects over the years. I upgraded it’s memory to 2GB. I replaced it’s laughably small 4GB SSD with a 32GB one.  I upgraded it from Windows XP Home, via several versions of Ubuntu, to Windows 10 Home. You may be surprised that such a machine can run Windows 10 and MS Office but it can do so, just not well. I backed it up (virtualized it for VMWare) and installed a fresh copy of Lubuntu. I fired up the web oscilloscope under FireFox and now I have a working detector:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="600" src="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-01-105609_1024x600_scrot.png" alt="" srcset="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-01-105609_1024x600_scrot.png 1024w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-01-105609_1024x600_scrot-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>You can quite clearly see a detector pulse in the screenshot. The noise sometimes peaks and can give a false reading but these are fairly easy to spot. The false pulses are one sided and lack the rebound peak of a true pulse. From around 25g of KCl, I’m seeing two or three pulses per minute in the detector</p>



<h2>So what comes next?</h2>



<p>OK, now that the detector is working, what comes next? Our first plan is to try out the python script to make sure that we can see and correctly analyze the energy spectrum from the KCl.  Step three will be to try various things to reduce the electrical noise. I have a suspicion that the tin leaks a little light into its interior but that can be remedied with black tape. Step three will be trying out various samples from my small mineral collection in the …</p></div></div>

<p>The Secondary Memory Interface (SMI) is a parallel I/O interface that is included in all the Raspberry Pi versions. It is rarely used due to the acute lack of publicly-available documentation; the only information I can find is in the source code to an external memory device driver <a href="https://github.com/Ysurac/raspberry_kernel_mptcp/blob/master/include/linux/broadcom/bcm2835_smi.h">here</a>, and an experimental IDE interface <a href="https://github.com/fenlogic/IDE_trial">here</a>.</p>



<p>However, it is a very useful general-purpose high-speed parallel interface, that deserves wider usage; in this post I’m testing it with digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital converters (DAC and ADC) but there are many other parallel-bus devices that would be suitable.</p>

<p>To take advantage of the high data rates, I’ll be using the C language, and Direct Memory Access (DMA); if you are unfamiliar with DMA on the RPi, I suggest you read my previous 2 posts on the subject, <a href="https://iosoft.blog/raspberry-pi-dma-programming/">here</a> and <a href="https://iosoft.blog/fast-data-capture-raspberry-pi/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Parallel interface</h2>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1941" data-permalink="https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/smi2/" data-orig-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png" data-orig-size="447,123" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="smi2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=447" src="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=447" alt="" srcset="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png 447w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=150 150w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 85vw, 447px"><figcaption>Raspberry Pi SMI signals</figcaption></figure>



<p>The SMI interface has up to 18 bits of data, 6 address lines, read &amp; write select lines. Transfers can be initiated internally, or externally via read &amp; write request lines, which can take over the uppermost 2 bits of the data bus. Transfer data widths are 8, 9, 16 or 18 bits, and are fully supported by First In First Out (FIFO) buffers, and DMA; this makes for efficient memory usage when driving an 8-bit peripheral, since a single 32-bit DMA transfer can automatically be converted into four 8-bit accesses.</p>



<p>If you have ever worked with the classic bus-interfaces of the original microprocessors, you’ll feel quite at home with SMI, but no need to worry about timing problems, because the setup, strobe &amp; hold times are fully programmable with 4 nanosecond resolution; what luxury!</p>



<p>The SMI functions are assigned to specific GPIO pins:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1947" data-permalink="https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/rpi_smi_pins-2/" data-orig-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png" data-orig-size="611,631" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rpi_smi_pins" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=290" data-large-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=611" src="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=611" alt="" srcset="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png 611w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=145 145w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=290 290w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>The GPIO pins to be included in the parallel interface are selected by setting their mode to ALT1; there is no requirement to set all the SMI pins in this way, so the I2C, SPI and PWM interfaces are still quite usable.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>



<p>The simplest device to drive from the parallel bus is a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC), using resistors from each data line to a common output. This arrangement is commonly known as an R-2R ladder, due to the resistor values needed.</p>



<p>I’ve used a pre-built device from Digilent (details <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/r2r-module-retired/">here</a>, or newer version <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-r2r-resistor-ladder-d-a-converter/">here</a>) but it is easy to make your own using discrete resistors; the least-significant is connected to GPIO8 (SD0), and the most-significant to GPIO15 (SD7).</p>



<h4>Software</h4>



<p>I’ll be making extensive use of the dma_utils functions that were created for my previous DMA projects, but before diving into the complication of SMI, it is helpful to test the hardware using simpler GPIO commands:</p>


<pre title="">#define DAC_D0_PIN      8
#define DAC_NPINS       8

extern MEM_MAP gpio_regs;
map_periph(&amp;gpio_regs, (void *)GPIO_BASE, PAGE_SIZE);

// Output value to resistor DAC (without SMI)
void dac_ladder_write(int val)
{
    *REG32(gpio_regs, GPIO_SET0) = (val &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; DAC_D0_PIN;
    *REG32(gpio_regs, GPIO_CLR0) = (~val &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; DAC_D0_PIN;
}

// Initialise resistor DAC
void dac_ladder_init(void)
{
    int i;
    
    for (i=0; i&lt;DAC_NPINS; i++)
        gpio_mode(DAC_D0_PIN+i, GPIO_OUT);
}

// Output sawtooth waveform
dac_ladder_init();
while (1)
{
    i = (i + 1) % 256;
    dac_ladder_write(i);
    usleep(10);
}
</pre>


<p>This is less-than-ideal because we have to use one command to set some I/O pins to 1, and another command to clear the rest to 0, so in the gap between them the I/O state will be incorrect; also we won’t get accurate timing with the usleep command.</p>



<p>To my surprise, when I ran this code on a Pi Zero, and viewed the output on an oscilloscope, it didn’t look too bad; however, as soon as I moved the mouse, there were very significant gaps in the output, so clearly we need to do better.</p>



<h4>SMI register definitions</h4>



<p>To use SMI, we first need to define the control registers, and the bit-values within them. The primary reference is bcm2835_smi.h from the Broadcom external memory driver, but I found this difficult to use in my code, so converted the definitions into C bitfields; this makes the code a bit less portable, but a lot simpler and easier to read.</p>



<p>Also, when learning about a new peripheral, it is helpful if the bitfield values can be printed on the console. This normally requires the tedious copying of register field names into string constants, but with a small amount of macro processing, this can be done with a single definition, for example the SMI CS register:</p>


<pre title="">#define REG_DEF(name, fields) typedef union {struct {volatile uint32_t fields;}; volatile uint32_t value;} name

#define SMI_CS_FIELDS \
    enable:1, done:1, active:1, start:1, clear:1, write:1, _x1:2,\
    teen:1, intd:1, intt:1, intr:1, pvmode:1, seterr:1, pxldat:1, edreq:1,\
    _x2:8, _x3:1, aferr:1, txw:1, rxr:1, txd:1, rxd:1, txe:1, rxf:1  
REG_DEF(SMI_CS_REG, SMI_CS_FIELDS);

volatile SMI_CS_REG  *smi_cs;

smi_cs  = (SMI_CS_REG *) REG32(smi_regs, SMI_CS);
</pre>


<p>The last bit of code is needed so that smi_cs points to the register in virtual memory; if you don’t understand why, I suggest you read my post on RPi DMA programming <a href="https://iosoft.blog/raspberry-pi-dma-programming/">here</a>. Anyway, the upshot of all this code is that we can access the whole 32-bit value of the register as smi_cs-&gt;value, and also individual bits such as smi_cs-&gt;enable, smi_cs-&gt;done, etc.</p>



<p>To print out the bit values, we use macros to convert the register definition to a string, then have a simple C parser:</p>


<pre title="">#define STRS(x)     STRS_(x) ","
#define STRS_(...)  #__VA_ARGS__

char *smi_cs_regstrs = STRS(SMI_CS_FIELDS);

// Display bit values in register
void disp_reg_fields(char *regstrs, char *name, uint32_t val)
{
    char *p=regstrs, *q, *r=regstrs;
    uint32_t nbits, v;
    
    printf("%s %08X", name, val);
    while ((q = strchr(p, ':')) != 0)
    {
        p = q + 1;
        nbits = 0;
        while (*p&gt;='0' &amp;&amp; *p&lt;='9')
            nbits = nbits * 10 + *p++ - '0';
        v = val &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; nbits) - 1);
        val &gt;&gt;= nbits;
        if (v &amp;&amp; *r!='_')
            printf(" %.*s=%X", q-r, r, v);
        while (*p==',' || *p==' ')
            p = r = p + 1;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
</pre>


<p>Now we can display all the non-zero bit values using:</p>


<pre title="">disp_reg_fields(smi_cs_regstrs, "CS", *REG32(smi_regs, SMI_CS));
</pre>


<p>..which produces a display like..</p>


<pre title="">CS 54000025 enable=1 active=1 write=1 txw=1 txd=1 txe=1
</pre>


<h4>SMI registers</h4>



<p>The SMI registers are:</p>


<pre title="">CS:  control and status
L:   data length (number of transfers)
A:   address and device number
D:   data FIFO
DMC: DMA control
DSR: device settings for read
DSW: device settings for write
DCS: direct control and status
DCA: direct control address and device number
DCD: direct control data
</pre>


<p>You can specify up to 4 unique timing settings for read &amp; write, making 8 settings in total. The settings are specified by giving a 2-bit device number for each transaction; this selects 1 of the 4 descriptors for read or write. I’ve only used one pair of settings, and the ADC &amp; DAC don’t have address lines, so the address &amp; device register remains at zero.</p>



<p>Direct mode is a simple way of doing accesses using the appropriate timings, but without DMA; it has separate address, data and control registers.</p>



<p>Some notable fields in the control &amp; status register are:</p>



<p><strong>Enable</strong>: it is obvious that this bit must be set for SMI to work, but it is less obvious when that should be done. Initially, I assumed it was necessary to enable the interface before any other initialisation, but then it responded with the ‘settings error’ bit set. So now I do most of the configuration with the device disabled, then enable it before clearing the FIFOs and enabling DMA, otherwise the transfers go through immediately.</p>



<p><strong>Start</strong>: set this bit to start the transfer; the SMI controller will perform the number of transfers in the length register, using the timing parameters specified in DSR (for read) or DSW (for write). If there is a backlog of data (FIFO is full) the transaction may stall.</p>



<p><strong>Pxldat</strong>: when this ‘pixel data’ bit is set, the 8- or 16-bit data is packed into 32-bit words.</p>



<p><strong>Pvmode</strong>: I have no idea what this ‘pixel valve’ mode should do; any information would be gratefully received.</p>



<h4>Direct Mode</h4>



<p>As the name implies, SMI Direct Mode allows you to perform a single I/O transfer without DMA. However, it is still necessary to specify the timing parameters of the transfer, specifically:</p>



<ul><li>The clock period, that will be used for the following timing:<ul><li>The setup time, that is used by the peripheral to decode the address value</li><li>The width of the strobe pulse, that triggers the transfer</li><li>The hold time, that keeps the signals stable after the transfer</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>To add to the complication, the SMI controller can drive 4 peripheral devices, each with its own individual read &amp; write settings, so there are a total of 8 timing registers. I’m keeping this simple by always using the first register pair (for device zero) but it is worth remembering that you can define more than one set of timings, and quickly switch between them by setting the device number.</p>



<p>Likewise, I’m ignoring the address field since it is also redundant for my DAC; for safety, I clear all the SMI registers on startup, in case there are any residual unwanted values.</p>



<p>As it happens, this setup/strobe/hold timing is largely redundant for our simple resistor DAC (since it doesn’t latch the data) but we still need to specify something, for example if we want the overall cycle time to be 1 microsecond, this can be achieved with a clock period of 10 nanoseconds, setup 25, strobe 50, and hold 25, since (25 + 50 + 25) * 10 = 1000 nanoseconds. This is the code I use to set the timing:</p>


<pre title="">// Width values
#define SMI_8_BITS  0
#define SMI_16_BITS 1
#define SMI_18_BITS 2
#define SMI_9_BITS  3

// Initialise SMI interface, given time step, and setup/hold/strobe counts
// Clock period is in nanoseconds: even numbers, 2 to 30
void …</pre></div></article></div>

EV articles I have read on Hacker News and Reddit didn’t prepare me for a dozen EV infrastructure problems in my part of the EU. Anecdotes below explain lessons I learned the hard way.</em></p><p>When I see a cool new gadget, my rationality goes away. I tell myself, “Don’t buy another device that will somehow be discharged when you need it,” but to no avail. The siren call would sing, “It has USB-C!” until my wallet opens wider than the Spielberg’s “Jaws”.</p><p>This time, the siren call was a government incentive of 10,600 EUR ($12,100) for a new electric vehicle purchase. “Great,” I thought, “I need to replace my old car.” My experience of driving electric car-shares in Oxford and Berlin was great. So, I purchased a 1.5-ton gadget, with no USB-C ports included, called <a href="https://ev-database.org/car/1204/Hyundai-Kona-Electric-64-kWh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyundai Kona EV</a>:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small.jpg"><img title="Hyundai Kona EV, Credits: https://ev-database.org/car/1204/Hyundai-Kona-Electric-64-kWh" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-1024x540.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="308" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-300x158.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-768x405.jpg 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-500x264.jpg 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small.jpg 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a></p><p>Why not a Tesla Model 3, you ask? Fun fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikola Tesla</a> was a naming inspiration for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla cars</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikola trucks</a>. Tesla was an ethnic Serbian born in present-day Croatia, but you can’t officially buy a Tesla or Nikola vehicle in Croatia (where I live) or Serbia. Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1176190550854127616?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted his hope to open sales in the region early in 2020</a>, but as of August 2020 that didn’t happen.</p><p>First, the good parts: as soon as I picked up my car in Zagreb, Croatia, I was impressed. EVs are so quiet that EU law requires they produce a buzzing sound when going slower than 30 km/h. Acceleration is instant; torque is strong enough, even in Eco mode, to make tires scream if I pushed the “gas” pedal too fast. There are no vibrations and no jerking when the car shifts gears. EVs use regenerative breaking, again completely silent. EV charging is currently free in Croatia, and depending on rainfall, <a href="http://mecometer.com/whats/croatia/electricity-production-by-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44% of that electricity is carbon-free</a>. I was in love with the car.</p><p>The first weekend I drove with a group of friends to a <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/leadership-central/speech-contests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toastmaster’s competition</a> in Ljubljana, Slovenia, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/A1tH92uEFXTUHuu96" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">143 km from Zagreb</a> (83 mi). Kona EV with 64 kWh battery has a declared range of 450 km (280 mi), so even with 90% battery, I had enough for a round trip. So I thought. I soon learned the first lesson:</p><p><em>#1: EVs have <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a31898441/study-ev-winter-range-loss-averages-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20% shorter range</a> in cold weather.</em></p><p>It was November. But still, 450 x 90% x 0.8 = 324 km, round trip is 286 km, we were good. While driving 130 km/h on a highway (80mph, a legal limit), I noticed my range dropping significantly. The car specs sheet lied in the worst possible way: they were technically correct. High torque: true. Range of 450 km: true. But:</p><p><em>#2: EVs can’t deliver both performance and declared range at the same time, you need to choose one.</em></p><p>I had the wrong intuition that cars have a longer range on the highway than in the city. That is true for gas cars because gas cars are extremely inefficient in cities. All cylinders are running, swallowing gas when accelerating, and that kinetic energy is lost when braking. As EVs use only the energy needed and recuperate that energy when breaking, they really have a declared range when driving in the city. When driving fast, EV range shortens because <a href="https://www.softschools.com/formulas/physics/air_resistance_formula/85/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air resistance is proportional to the square of speed</a>. Gas engines are more efficient when all cylinders are firing at constant, high RPMs. As a result, gas cars have a <a href="https://www.mpgforspeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximum range at speeds of 89-97 km/h (55-60 mph)</a>. EVs have a maximum range at <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/15/tesla-range-plotted-relative-to-speed-temperature-graphs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 55 km/h (35 mph)</a>, and range falls linearly as you drive faster. For example, this is the range decrease for Tesla Model S, depending on speed and temperature:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png"><img title="Tesla Model S100 range vs speed vs temperature, Credits: https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/15/tesla-range-plotted-relative-to-speed-temperature-graphs/" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande-300x225.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande-400x300.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>As I slowed down, the estimated range increased. Unfortunately, part of the highway was closed for construction, and we needed to take a detour. The round trip just got longer, so I decided to park at the EV charging place. But, it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_connector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type 2 AC charger</a>, meaning another lesson was coming:</p><p><em>#3: To charge at Type 2 AC plugs in the EU, you need to bring your cable.</em></p><p>Of course, I had none. Fast chargers I used before had attached cables, and I was wondering what was the point of <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kona-EV-Charging-Auto-Lock.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cable lock button on Hyundai Kona</a>? It is there because:</p><p><em>#4: Lock your <a href="https://www.evexpert.eu/p/338/duosida-charging-cable-type2-type2-32a-3phase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">230 EUR Type 2 cable</a> if you don’t want it stolen.</em></p><p>Between event sessions, I was Googling “fast EV chargers in Slovenia.” Highway stops by “Petrol” had them, great. Around 11 PM, we left Ljubljana in high spirits. We arrived at the Petrol station and found a fast charger, with cables. Guess what happened next:</p><p><em>#5: EU fast chargers are activated via a proprietary chip card or smartphone app. Each company in each country uses a different card / app.</em></p><p>Of course, I only had a smartphone charging app for Croatia. Lessons were coming fast:</p><p><em>#5A: Petrol gas stations clerks can’t sell you a Petrol charging card, and they can’t activate an EV charging even when you want to pay for it.</em></p><p>“Download and register in the Petrol app,” the night clerk said. Yes, but:</p><p><em>#5B: Petrol Android app is 50 MB, so if a station is covered by a <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/glossary.php3?term=edge#:~:text=EDGE%20(also%20known%20as%20Enhanced,order%20to%20conserve%20spectrum%20resources." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slow EDGE signal</a>, you can’t download the app.</em></p><p>We got back to the highway, where my friend caught H+ signal and downloaded the app. At the next Petrol station, we discovered:</p><p><em>#5C: When you hit the “Start charging” button in the Petrol app, it redirects you to a registration form to enter payment and address.</em></p><p>No problem, I can fill the form, even on EDGE signal. But then:</p><p><em>#5D: To register in the Petrol app, needed for charging, you need a valid address in Slovenia.</em></p><p>It is good the EV charging station was 20 meters away from the gas station because I was cursing Petrol so loud a clerk would have had all rights to call the police. I should have read <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=si.petrol.onecharge&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Petrol app comments</a> beforehand:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1.png"><img title="Petrol app comments" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-1024x732.png" alt="" width="584" height="417" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-1024x732.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-300x214.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-768x549.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-420x300.png 420w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1.png 1105w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a>It was past midnight when we got back on the highway. To extend the range, I slowed down to 75 km/h (46 mph). The limit was 130km/h, so a trailer truck started taking over us. Then I remembered a Tour de France strategy I saw on TV:</p><p><em>#6: In an emergency, you can extend the range of your EV by tailgating a&nbsp; trailer truck, a strategy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafting_(aerodynamics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aerodynamic drafting</a>.</em></p><p>Don’t hold me responsible for traffic tickets or beating by an angry trucker. There I was, hidden behind a trailer truck, to save electricity while driving 90 km/h. The car showed it was using less power, and the range extended. When we entered Zagreb, there was 19 km left:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small.jpg"><img title="Kona EV low battery warning, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-300x233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-300x233.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-387x300.jpg 387w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p>I went to a fast-charging station I could actually activate, and I fell asleep in the car.</p><p>I made fun of Petrol for their unfriendliness towards tourists, but at least the EV chargers at Petrol stations are working. In Croatia, you can’t always count on that. In my modest opinion, that stems from the fact that charging is free. Why is free electricity a problem, you ask? There is no commercial incentive to build and maintain charging stations. Instead, most chargers are built when the EU donates money or when the government is pressed to improve EV infrastructure. Local politicians come when a charging station is finished to deliver speeches: “This is an example of Croatia using EU funds wisely, for a green and sustainable future.” After the journalists leave, there is no economic interest in sustaining chargers in the future.</p><p>For example, this city-provided Type 2 charger has been broken for three months:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 1, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg" alt="" width="641" height="873" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg 641w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></a></p><p>In front of the Zagreb city hall, one charging station displays an error:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 2, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg" alt="" width="704" height="455" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg 704w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1-464x300.jpg 464w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"></a></p><p>While other just states it is out of order:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 3, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="145" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg 535w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2-300x81.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2-500x136.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px"></a></p><p>What I learned is:</p><p><em>#7: Free chargers are often unmaintained, and you are better with a commercial provider you can hold accountable.</em></p><p>“But, there is nothing to break on a charging station!” I thought. Boy, I was wrong. EV charging stations use internal computer for authorization, and for controlling the display and the charging protocol. Before charging starts, a car locks the cable with the mechanical pin and signals that back to the charger. When a car is unlocked, it signals a charger to drop the voltage to zero, so the mechanical pin holding cable can be released. Guess what?</p><p><em>#8: Some chargers are not compatible with some EVs and refuse to stop charging, resulting in the “Hotel California effect.” You can check out in the app, but you can never leave.</em></p><p>For example, Croatian Telecom chargers. The first time their cable got stuck in my car I panicked. Their app was not working, the charger was not responding to car signals, and their charging stations don’t have the stop button:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg"><img title="HT charger cable locked, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg" alt="" width="899" height="585" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg 899w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-300x195.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-768x500.jpg 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-461x300.jpg 461w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px"></a></p><p>They have the contact phone, but it was Sunday afternoon. I called them, expecting three levels of menus and “we are not working on weekends” message. To my great surprise, a female voice answered after two rings. “I have a big problem with your EV charging station: I can’t get my car out because…” My explanation was stopped by “What is the serial number written on the station?” As I dictated the serial, I could hear fast typing. A few seconds later charging station stopped buzzing, display went blank for a moment, and I could unplug my car. “Wow, that was fast, thank you very much!” I said. Although they currently don’t charge for electricity, Croatian Telekom is a commercial operation. They have a direct 24/7 support line where a representative can reset any charging station in Croatia, provided the serial number. It seems that such a solution was easier than fixing charging stations or the charging app. I now just call them and say, “Can you reset the station with serial X?” If you work there, let me know, I would like to buy a box of chocolates for the team.</p><p>Unfortunately, EV charges are not the only thing broken here. Our driving culture is also broken:</p><p><em>#9: It is common to find a gas car parked at the EV charging spot, the practice called <a href="https://twitter.com/ivebeeniced?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICEing</a> (internal combustion engine-ing).</em></p><p>One time I urgently needed to charge, and this was the charging spot:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg"><img title="Blocking EV parking, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg" alt="" width="717" height="785" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg 717w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px"></a></p><p>ICEing is common around the world.

<p>“Xpra is a tool which allows you to run X programs — usually on a remote host — and then direct their display to your local machine, disconnect from these programs, and reconnect from<br>
the same or another machine, all without losing any state. It differs from standard X forwarding in that it allows disconnection and reconnection without disrupting the forwarded<br>
application; it differs from VNC and similar remote display technologies in that xpra is rootless: i.e., applications forwarded by xpra appear on your desktop as normal windows managed<br>
by your window manager, rather than being all “trapped in a box together”. Xpra also uses a custom protocol that is self-tuning and relatively latency-insensitive, and thus is usable<br>
over network connections that are too slow or unreliable for standard X forwarding. Xpra can also be used to shadow an existing X11 display.”</p>

        <p>The machine that powered numerous Number Stations</p>
      
        <p>
          uberardy — 2020-08-29
        </p>
      </div>
  
  <div>
    <p>A few years ago, I first stumbled over some recordings of number stations and started reading up on their history. For most of them, we have pretty good guesses who ran them and for what purpose. One example is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxlrnAC7Y7Q">Gongs and Chimes Station</a>, known for its melody that got increasingly creepy over the years, the more worn down the tape got. What always seemed mysterious to me is the kinds of devices used to actually generate the spoken messages. Were they similar to electromechanical devices used for time announcements over the telephone, <a href="https://youtu.be/4aMqKr0D-7o?t=47">with multiple play heads</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lESMfh72RJg">complicated tape mechanisms</a>?</p>
<p>Then, I stumbled over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4buFLqjvTjA">this video</a>. And... It's <em>the actual voice</em> used by the <em>Gongs and Chimes</em> Station? What surprised me was how rather small, polished and complex the machine seemed. There definitely was a microcontroller in there, it had an LED display, and just in general seemed like a rather fancy device.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/sprach-morse-generator.jpg" alt="Grey box-shaped machine with a tilted front panel. There are a paper punch tape reader, LED display and numeric keyboard with some extra buttons on the front."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The most important thing however was, I finally knew what to look for. Searching for "Sprach-Morse-Generator" (Speech-Morse-Generator) quickly got me to <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/index.htm">a page about it at the crypto museum</a> which also mentions its official name: "Gerät 32620" (Device 32620). The page also has some great information about the history of the device and the voice behind it.</p>
<p>What exited me the most was... There are actually links to technical documentation about the Speech generator and its companion device, Gerät 32621, which could be used for digitizing voice recordings and writing them to EPROM cartridges to use with Gerät 32620.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4061.pdf">The 32620 Guide</a></h3>
<p>I don't want to go over everything mentioned in these guides; if you speak German I'd recommend giving it a read yourself; but I do want to mention some things I found notable.</p>
<p>As input, either paper punch tapes, the keyboard, or a serial interface (RS-232) can be used. The last one is a bit unclear, it is mentioned in the beginning, but later parts of the document mention it as a possible future addition. Either way, the messages are transferred to RAM, from where they can later be transmitted. It can hold up to 3791 characters.</p>
<p>The language samples are loaded from an exchangeable cartridge which can hold up to 96 kByte, where they are stored as uncompressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a> . They proudly mention the cartridges can be swapped in 10 seconds.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The number of words per minute and pitch of the voice can be varied, which explains why some recordings of number stations with the same voice sound a bit different.</p>

    </p>

<p>What I find quite surprising: The keyboard and output of the device mostly uses English words. A bit unexpected for a device developed in eastern Germany for use in the Soviet Union; I would rather have expected Russian there.</p>

    <p>There are some pretty charming charts in the documentation showing some interactions with the device.</p>

    </p>
    <p>On the back are a speaker, output to the transmitter and some status outputs and remote control inputs. These were probably used so the chimes and speech wouldn't overlap.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also pretty detailed schematic drawings and lists of component at the end of the document.</p>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4062b.pdf">The 32621 Guide</a></h3>
<p>This is the companion device used for digitizing voices and writing them to cartridges for the 32620. It's quite astounding how complicated this device really is: It can either record words separately or all of them in one go, it automatically recognizes the beginning and end of the words, it can duplicate cartridges and it even has a UV chamber for clearing the EEPROMS on a cartridge to reuse it.</p>
<p>What's interesting: There are no photos of this device. It's unclear how many were produced, there may just have been one or two. The only things we know about it are from this document.</p>
<p>In its architecture, it is quite similar to the 32620, it has a very similar keyboard and probably the same display.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>One interesting difference: It uses German labels on the keyboard. Also, all of the text it shows on the display is in German.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/tastatur2.png" alt=""> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The documentation mentions recording up to 20 words. This also came up in the 32620's documentation, although only 13 words were ever used: digits 0-9, "Achtung" (Attention), "Trennung" (Seperation) and "Ende" (End).</p>
<p>It has controls for adjusting the 0-level of the recordings and amplification. LEDs show whether it senses an audio signal and whether it's clipping. The amplification for single words can also be adjusted later, from a value of 0 to 7. It seems like this doesn't actually change the recorded samples but controls the amplification level in the digital to analogue converter. This feature is intended for making all the digits similar in volume.</p>
<p>I find this a bit surprising, all of this is something that could be done with other equipment, especially since only two different voices for these machines are known: German and Spanish.</p>
<p>In order to check the recording, either all recorded digits or just combinations of them can be played back.</p>
<p>When programming to an EPROM, it transfers the start address and amplification for each word and the samples from RAM to the ROM and checks whether the values it reads back after programming are as expected.</p>

<p>There is a separate mode for deleting cartridges where the time to expose them to UV can be typed in via the keyboard. If the rom cartridge is double sided, the cartridge has to be turned around to delete the chips on the other side.</p>

<div>
    <p>For all of the different modes of the 32621, flow charts for the interface are provided.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The front also features various other indicators, e.g. for the different voltages in the device.</p>
</div>

<p>This manual also includes schematics for the device.</p>

<div>
    <h3>The EPROMS</h3>
<p>The crypto museum also provides dumps of the EPROMS for both the German and Spanish cartridges.</p>
<p>Having read the manuals, decoding them is actually not that hard: The data is stored as PCM, and the 32621 Guide mentions the time between samples is 125μs, which adds up to a sample rate of 8000Hz.
Loading the roms into Audacity with File&gt;Import&gt;Raw Data, you can actually already listen to them!</p>
<p>[Edit: Here are the dumps as WAVs, if you're interested: <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_ger.wav">german</a>, <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_span.wav">spanish</a>]</p>
<h4>The Header</h4>
<p>In the very beginning of the first EPROM, there are 64 byte of header information, containing the start address for each word and its amplification factor. For 20 words, that leaves just over 3 bytes per word, although they seem to just stick to 3.</p>
<p>Decoding the rest of the header took a lot longer than anticipated. I found the 3 bits for the amplification value pretty quickly in the last byte for each word. The rest somehow had to be the start address or some offset, and possibly the length. For accessing the values in each of the 8K chips, 13 Bits for the address are needed. To select one of the up to 12 EPROMs, another 4 Bit are required. This adds up to 17 Bits, so one more than in two bytes.</p>
<p>To get around this, there are two obvious solutions: Stuff the one extra bit into the byte which holds the amplification level, or throw away the least significant bit for the start address, so just every other sample can be used as the start sample.</p>
<p>Two things made this really hard to pin down: The z80 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little endian machine</a>, meaning for 16 bit values, the less significant byte is stored before the more significant byte, but this doesn't mean they would <em>have</em> to store the values in this order. Also, the binary chip select value for the first EPROM isn't 0, but 2. I only stumbled upon that when looking at the schematic for the EPROM cartridge (p. 38 in the 32620 manual). There's also a really cute demultiplexer built from discrete AND and NAND gates for translating the chip address to the actual chip select lines!</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>Isn't it gorgeous! Note how it only <em>suggests</em> the presence of the fourth address line for the chip select with that not connected NAND.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/demux.png" alt="The schematic for the demultiplexer built out of discreet components."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>My best guess to why is the case is the chip select address values 0 and 1 are already used to select some other components. But, at last, I think I found out how it works:</p>
<p>For each word, the second byte contains the 3 least significant bits for the chip select and 5 of the address bits. The first byte contains the remaining 8 address bits. The end of each word is the beginning address for the next word. That's why there are two extra bytes after the last word. This would have worked for up to twenty words, as there would still be 4 spare bytes to contain the end address of the last word. The third byte contains the remaining chip select bit, some mysterious bits, and 3 bits for the amplification level.</p>
<p>The remaining chip select bit is still a bit confusing to me: The German recordings don't use it, since they fit on just 6 EPROMs. The Spanish one has to use it for the last two words, but there's something odd happening with the values in the one before the last two words.</p>
<p>Another thing worth noting: The German words all use the default amplification level of 3, whereas the Spanish ones use lower and higher values for some words. To be <em>really</em> authentic, you'd have to take that into account when playing the samples.</p>
<p>One last thing I was interested in: The Spanish voice uses the same word for "Trennung" and "Ende"&amp;em;"final", and they sure <em>sound</em> the same. So, is …</p></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Why I Actively Discourage Online Tooling Like Jwt.io and Online JSON Validators]]>

September 1, 2020 | https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>You already know that I'm pretty frustrated with the way we do things on the web. In order to fetch a list of things and display them as rectangles on a webpage, we need to jump through 1938137 hoops. What is this, Circus Charlie? Anyone? Remember that game??? I'm old 😭</p>&nbsp;<h2>The problem with our current stack</h2><p>The process of making a web app is so unnecessarily complex and so many people are going for a SPA even when it's not needed. GraphQL makes working with an API easy, but it still involves building that API, and writing a lot of boilerplate. You might not mind all of that until someone removes the layer for you. And that's <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blitz</a>.</p>&nbsp;<p>"Damn, I just want to fetch some data directly from the database and display it!" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"You can do that with PHP and raw SQL..." - Someone on HN, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"LMAO" - You</p>&nbsp;<p>"Well, why don't you use Rails?" - Someone on Reddit, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"I only know JavaScript and I want to use React" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Welp, too bad there's nothing similar to Rails in the React world..." - Someone on Twitter, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Hey, what if there was a Fullstack React framework, similar to Ruby on Rails?" - Blitz, if it could talk, probably</p>&nbsp;<p><em>Meteor crying in the corner, probably</em></p>&nbsp;<h2>What is Blitz?</h2><p>Blitz "removes" the API layer in a very clever way so you can directly call functions from your backend, which completely changes the game. Actually, this is not the best way to describe what it does, so you better <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the docs</a>. TL;DR: it's magic.</p>&nbsp;<p>What I like about Blitz is that it builds on top of already solid solutions like <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-query</a>, and <a href="https://prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>. I already used them in other projects, but I love the way Blitz glues all of them together and it magically works. </p>&nbsp;<p>The ability to get whatever you want directly from the database, with the nicely typed API from Prisma, and then just display it, is a pretty wonderful experience. It makes me feel that for years we had no frickin' clue why we did things the way we did them, until finally someone realized that we don't have to do them that way.</p>&nbsp;<p>When generating a new Blitz app you get all the authentication boilerplate generated for you and I all I have to say is <em>fucking finally</em>.  It's 2020, I don't want to build the authentication layer again, and again, and again, and again. Hey frameworks, just let me get me the current user with <code>const user = useCurrentUser()</code> and don't bother me with anything else.</p>&nbsp;<p>I can't even describe how fast you can ship a product when there is no API layer and boilerplate involved. </p>&nbsp;<p>There are similar frameworks to Blitz which go in a completely different direction by rebuilding most of the stack. Personally, I'm tired of the React community constantly reinventing things that don't need reinventing. Next.js is already amazing, so just imagine how much code we'd be able to reuse if we all agree on using it by default. More reusing, less reinventing, please.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Launching a production app in a few days</h2><p>I already did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiLYvLNDeKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr-7Z9Grvfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streams</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/flybayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon</a>, the creator of Blitz, and I couldn't wait to actually try Blitz on a real project. The problem is, I needed a real project because I didn't want to waste my time on some demo gibberish which is never going to see the light of day.</p>&nbsp;<p>I got frustrated by the app that I was using for writing changelogs for <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sizzy</a>, so I decided to sit down and write <a href="https://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own tool</a> with some more advanced features that will make the process easier. </p>&nbsp;<p>I <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestreamed the entire process</a> from "hello world" to deployment and I couldn't believe that it only took me only 5 days. </p>&nbsp;<p>Actually, the majority of the work was done in only 2 days, which is crazy. Someone commented "my boss shouldn't see this" on the stream and the credit for that goes to Blitz. You can definitely ship faster than a team of people who would argue about the modeling of the API, raw SQL queries, and whether to use redux-saga or RxJS for fetching the data.</p>&nbsp;<p>Hey Kitze, if you finished most of the things in 2 days, why did it take you 5 days?</p>&nbsp;<p>Great question, reader.</p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 3: Polishing the design and adding extra features</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 4: Deployment. I deployed the database to DigitalOcean without a problem, but I had a problem with deploying the Blitz app to Vercel. Turns out, the problem wasn't with Blitz or Vercel and it was ... TypeScript. Yup, I couldn't deploy the app because TS was being a pain in the ass, and the Vercel logs didn't show that. I had to dive deep, find the problematic files, and fix everything, so that took most of the day.</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 5: CSS. Of course. You can put as many layers as you want on top of CSS, it's still CSS at the end of the day. I literally lost an entire day on centering things and making sure the fixed header and sticky footer layouts work in Safari on iOS. Oh, by the way, fuck Safari. We finally got rid of the pain that's IE pain, but Safari is here to replace it.</li></ul><h2>Why another changelog app?</h2><p>I would never make an app if there wasn't an actual need for it. There are tons of Saas products for making changelogs, but I had something different in mind.</p>&nbsp;<p>I was using a popular solution for writing the Sizzy changelogs for 1.5 years. However, the changelog was a huge markdown document, so we had to use Notion boards to plan the work as individual cards, and then collaborate on them with the Sizzy team. When we were done, we'd export markdown from all the cards and merge them in a giant markdown document. In the past 3 months, I'm working on the changelog alone, so I decided to directly write the giant markdown document. Aside from being an overwhelming experience, I also lost my 3 hours of progress by accidentally closing the tab.</p>&nbsp;<p>So I said: fuck it, I'd rather build a proper changelog app instead of writing this changelog again.</p>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to improve the process of collaborating and publishing a changelog, and in the process, I came up with a bunch of ideas that will hopefully change the changelog game. Wait... was there ever a <em>changelog game</em>? If not, there is now. Boom 🎤</p>&nbsp;<p>Wait, the mic should actually drop.</p>&nbsp;<p>🎤  </p>&nbsp;<p>There.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Introducing <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fungarzione</a> - The Changelog Of The Future</h2><p>Instead of publishing a giant markdown document, a team of collaborators would start working on individual entries. The editor supports Markdown, but also MDX, with a set of custom components that would make the changelogs way better. </p>&nbsp;<p>Creating a changelog entry is super simple, and it's not as overwhelming as starting a giant markdown document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Individual entries can then progress from Draft to Ready For Review, to Published. Team collaboration features like assigning people and commenting on the entries will be available when registration is open to everyone.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>After creating a bunch of entries, a changelog is created by combininig individual entries, as well as adding a list of small bug fixes and improvements, which will appear grouped at the end of the document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Then, the draft changelog is moved to "Ready for Review" and it cannot be published, unless all of the entries in that changelog area already published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Users can leave feedback individually for each changelog, as well as subscribe to get an email when a new changelog is published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione is live</h2><p>I already ported <a href="http://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last 10 changelogs for Sizzy</a> to Fungarzione and I'm already in love with the publishing experience. It's not that overwhelming and I can work on the changelog in chunks.</p>&nbsp;<p><em>self high-five</em></p>&nbsp;<p>Also, to be honest, even with my mediocre design skills, it already looks better than some of the popular changelog apps out there 🙈 </p>&nbsp;<p><em>taps myself on the back a bit more</em> </p>&nbsp;<p>If you're interested in signing up you can <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave your email here</a> and you'll get a notification when public access is available (hopefully soon).</p>&nbsp;<p>I'm also looking for people who'd like to port their changelog <em>now</em>, so I can get some feedback on the editor experience. You just need to have a production app with an established user base, as well as an existing changelog. Just <a href="mailto:kristijan.mkd@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot me an email</a> and we can discuss.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Conclusion on Blitz</h2><p>I still have to explore Blitz a bit more to figure out all the downsides, but I think that I'd definitely pick Blitz for most of my future apps, unless I have a really specific reason not to. Brandon said there will be a way to reuse the same Blitz client in React Native apps, so you won't miss the actual API layer.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione</h2><p>I know what you're thinking right now.</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione?!</p>&nbsp;<p>FUNGARZIONE?!?! What the hell does the name mean, Kitze?</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione comes from the word Fungangarzione. And the origin of Fungangarzione is really a long story, so I guess you'll have to <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hang out in my stream</a> to find out 😜 I'm planning to live stream the rest of the work on this app, and trust me, there are too way too many things that I'd like to do. If you have any ideas or suggestions you're more welcome to join my stream! 🙌</p>&nbsp;<p>I want to give another shout-out to all the people on Twitch who helped me while I was building this app (even though they're credited in the footer of the page).</p>&nbsp;<p>There's no way I would've shipped it in such a short time without your help 💜</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

If you want to avoid these topics, please jump to the last paragraph of this introduction, starting with ‘Enough about the depressing stuff.’</em></p><p>Before we start, I feel like I need to give a bit of background on why I care so deeply about privacy. It’s partly historical. Being Ashkenazi, I learnt from a very young age about the importance of sensitive information, and who you give that information to. My grandfather broke the law by not going to the police station to register himself as a Jew. The Holocaust saw 76,000 Jews deported to death camps from France alone - around 1/4th of the country’s Jewish population at the time. There’s a chance that not being part of the Jewish census saved his life. Lesson: be careful who you give sensitive information to.</p><p>That grandfather and two of his brothers left Paris in the middle of the war, and took a train south with no plan, no luggage, no contact, and no destination other than, well, heading south. They were helped by strangers and survived. Their mother however, along with two other siblings, had a plan. They had a deal with a smuggler to reach unoccupied France. The smuggler informed the Nazis, and all 3 of them died in deportation. Lesson: each person who has information on you represents an additional chance for it to be leaked.</p><p>And yes, we can raise the irony of mentioning my Jewish grandpa to warn you against sharing sensitive information online. There, I just did.&nbsp;</p><p>While this happened in the 1940’s, a data point’s lifespan is drastically different today. It’s possible that you posted something online 10 years ago, and it was fine back then, but 20 years from now you will hope that no one finds it. My message is: the Internet never forgets, cultures change, and retroactive laws exist. People can get screwed over digital data. Let’s take the obvious example: China’s state surveillance has an eye on literally each and every move of its inhabitants, whether physical or digital. The state uses extensive data to allocate social scores, which can have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278?nw=0" target="_blank">drastic impact</a> on Chinese people’s life, including banning them from purchasing train or plane tickets, providing them with lower Internet speed, and denying them visas and loans. China also makes use of this surveillance system <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">against its Uyghur population</a>, detaining between 1 and 2 million people - the estimates vary - in concentration camps, where prisoners suffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps#Testimonies_of_treatment" target="_blank">extensively reported torture, brainwashing and forced labour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from governmental issues, there’s also the topic of pervasive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI" target="_blank">tracking and ads</a>, championed by Facebook and Google. I’m yet to see the difference between today’s digital advertising and individually-customised mass manipulation. Maybe because there is none. Please try and change my mind if you have any conclusive elements.</p><p>Enough about the depressing stuff. I’ve explained why your privacy matters, and we’re now about to dive into a few security concepts. I wrote this article with <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a>, as he knows much more about these concepts than I do. So here’s my first pro tip for you, unrelated to privacy or security: date people you admire. Now, let’s get into the technical aspects.</p><h2>CIA</h2><p>The CIA ‘triad’ is a summary of the main concepts of information security. There are 3 aspects regarding information which are targeted by infosec:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information can only be observed by authorised third parties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrity</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information is and stays accurate over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: the assurance that a piece of information can be accessed by an authorised user when they need it.</p></li></ul><h2>Encryption: Server-side vs. Client-side</h2><p>Encryption secures data and aims to maintain its confidentiality and integrity.</p><p>We differentiate server-side from client-side encryption. Server-side means that only information stored on said server is encrypted. This means that the company has the encryption key, and therefore can access your communication (yes, including your nudes). However, server-side encryption doesn’t apply to the <strong>transmission </strong>of your communication. The data you share is not necessarily encrypted, only the storage is, which is why you should favour platforms that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" target="_blank">https</a>.</p><p>Client-side – or end-to-end – encryption means that the transmission of your information is encrypted, and that <strong>only your device</strong> has the key. If you log in from a different device, you won’t be able to see the exchanges. Since the company <strong>does not have the key</strong>,<strong> </strong>they cannot access your messages. As a result, even if they were to store your exchanges, said exchanges would automatically be encrypted. However, this also means that you won’t be able to recover your messages, should you lose the key.</p><p>In the case of a communication service, this means that the nudes you're sending to <strong>someone you trust</strong> are encrypted from your device to the company's server, as well as from their server to your trusted partner's device. Without encryption however, anyone on your network can see and tamper with all your communications. By 'tamper with', we mean any kind of modification by an unauthorised third-party. Examples include someone changing your password and email address on a platform to take over your account, deleting your private files on a cloud file storage service, replacing software in your online backups with malware, etc.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_5282"><div><p>A recent example is the July Twitter hack, during which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1286088135525318656" target="_blank">hackers managed to read users' messages from Twitter's admin control panel</a>. &nbsp;With end-to-end encrypted DMs, no one at Twitter would have been able to access them.</p><h2>Encryption vs. Hashing</h2><p>A distinction has to be made between two important notions: encryption and hashing. Encrypting information means that you turn it into scrambled text which can be decoded with a key. For instance, it's useful to make sure a communication between two peers cannot be read by an unauthorised person.&nbsp;</p><p>Hashing a piece of data on the other hand means that you turn it into a <strong>unique signature</strong> which <strong>cannot be reversed</strong> into its original readable state. The only way for someone to obtain the original input based on the hashing output, is to try inputs themselves until their output matches. Hashing is not intended as a cypher to decrypt, which is why encryption and hashing serve different purposes and are used in different cases. Hashing is noticeably useful to store passwords, because you avoid storing the actual easy-to-steal-and-reuse passwords. Instead, you compare the hashing output that you store to the hashing output of what a user entered while trying to log in. If you get the same hash that you’ve stored, then the password is correct.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_7990"><div><h2>100% secure does not exist</h2><p>Flaws and vulnerabilities can always be found. However, the sturdier your tools, the safer you'll be. And contrary to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914" target="_blank">what A-ha used to sing</a>, it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><h2>Free vs. Open source</h2><p>Free and open source software are specific philosophies, based on specific values. Free software specifically refers to the notion of users' freedom, which isn't the case in open-source software. As <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank">the GNU website</a> puts it: 'To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”'.</p><p>There are 4 criteria for software to be free:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the programme as you wish, for any purpose.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the programme works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. This entails having access to the source code.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</p></li></ul><p>On the other hand, open-source software has a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">less strict definition</a>, and a different philosophy. You can also see the source code, amongst other things.</p><p>If you want to get into the political aspect of these terminologies, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html" target="_blank">here</a>’s a good explanation.</p><h2>Credential stuffing attack</h2><p>Credential stuffing is a popular attack whose goal is to automatically test a user’s known credentials on multiple platforms on a large scale. Nowadays, it is widely used by malicious intruders because of the online accessibility of billions of credentials gathered from data leaks (<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dating-the-ginormous-myspace-breach/" target="_blank">MySpace</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dailymotion-allegedly-hacked-85-million-user-accounts-stolen/" target="_blank">Dailymotion</a>, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-dropbox-hack-is-real/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> to name some of the biggest).</p><p>And there you have it, a roundup of the main security concepts. Feel free to reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/this2shallgrow" target="_blank">me</a> on Twitter. Part 2 will be available next week, with a list of the privacy and security tools we frequently use and recommend.</p><p>If you’re looking for a UX researcher or UX designer to work in the privacy and security sphere, I’d love to have a chat with you! </p></div></div></div>]]>

  <p>I meet regularly with early-career software developers. A few recurring meetings, 1x/week, plus ad-hoc calls as needed with others.</p>

<p>A question came up recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My three-month internship is close to wrapping up. The Co-founder/CEO/lead developer of the consulting company I’m at likes me, said he wishes he could hire me but cannot, because they don’t have enough work in the pipeline.</p>

  <p>He said he’d write me a letter of recommendation, and asked me to draft it for him.</p>

  <p>How do I write my own letter of recommendation, for my first real software development job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feels like a trap, huh?</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/office-hours-tufts.jpeg" alt="who are you?"></p>

<p><a href="https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/jumbo-talk/post/the-office-hours/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>Or, maybe they know you. They know you <em>too well</em></p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/recommendation-warning.jpg" alt="untrustworthy"></p>

<p><a href="https://blacklawyermagic.wordpress.com/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>I explained a few concepts that we wanted to “speak to” in the letter. I’ll explain.</p>

<p>The software developer that I meet with mentioned that the CEO’s advice on the next job included “be able to speak to low liability”.</p>

<p>I wanted to dig into this “liability” piece.</p>
      <h2 id="how-much-does-a-bad-hire-cost">
        
        
          How much does a bad hire cost? <a href="#how-much-does-a-bad-hire-cost">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>What’s the biggest risk in hiring?</p>

<p>It’s <em>the risk of a bad hire</em>.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to make a bad hire?</p>

<p>I would conservatively estimate that it costs $100,000 and nine months of your life. Here’s how the math works from a hiring manager’s point of view:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spend a month and 25 hours of labor dev team manager labor to find/interview the candidate(s) and winnow the applicants down to someone to make an offer.  (the hiring manager would prefer to be doing <em>literally anything else but hiring</em>.)</li>
  <li>Extend an offer, wait 2-6 more weeks before the new candidate starts. It can be painful to wait another six weeks, because the team is currently short-staffed, and has been for a long time. That’s why they’re hiring!</li>
  <li>Start date! Start paying $150,000/yr or $3000/week for your shiny new employee.</li>
  <li>Pay $12,000 for the first month of them working, figuring out your dev environment, ticket management, who knows what parts of the codebase, and a few easy bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Start getting nervous. Employee not batting it out of the park like you’d hoped. Maybe still onboarding, give it another month (and $12,000 in payroll expense).</li>
  <li>OK. Three months in and another $36,000 in payroll later, you’re pretty sure there’s a problem.</li>
  <li>Start the pre-Performance Improvement Plan work. Talk to their team, their manager, them. Why is it not working? Why is the team <em>working slower</em> with this new team member, instead of working faster? <em>Not only are you wasting five figures of payroll, the rest of your expensive dev team is producing less as well!</em></li>
  <li>Pre-PIP work is over. Another $5k in payroll gone forever. Now it’s time to give the formal PIP, which everyone knows is “beginning the firing process”</li>
  <li>Two more months and $24,000 in payroll later, you fire the employee.</li>
  <li>You feel relief with having gotten rid of the bad employee. You’re thrilled that you can get back to normal work.</li>
  <li>Check the clock and balance sheet. It took you nine months and $100k to get to where you were at step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Add up the time/expense:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1-2 months to to find/hire a candidate.</li>
  <li>7-8 months (and $84K-$96k) to hire, trial them, try to help them be successful, give up on that plan, and fire them.</li>
  <li>Many hours spent thinking about this specific problem, talking with others about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s nine months of your life. That’s 9 months of time, sure, but it’s also 9 months of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. What if you’d hired a great candidate? They’d be rapidly approaching their first year on the job, and everyone would be happy about it, instead of this disaster you’ve had to deal with.</p>

<p>Here’s the really scary part: To large organizations (1000+ employees), <em>wasting $100k is meaningless compared to the wasted time and mis-directed effort</em>. The entire organization is more annoyed at having <em>lost the time of a productive software developer</em>. They don’t care that they lit a giant pile of money on fire, <em>they’re annoyed that their competitor is getting new features out the door and gaining marketshare and the future of their $x,000,000 company hangs in the balance</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and the good managers, not only do they want to be wise with money and build features/gain market-share…</p>

<p>They want to see their team flourish.</p>

<p>Being fired is a life-defining moment. (I speak from experience)</p>

<p>If you’re a kind and empathetic person, <em>it’s particularly unpleasent to fire someone and it feels like a personal failure</em>.</p>

<p>You want to work for a kind and empathetic manager. (They’re not common, but they’re not impossible to find.)</p>

<p>So, tailor your letter to speak to the concerns of a kind and empathetic manager. This manager would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Want to see you do well</li>
  <li>Want to see you develop your skills and competencies</li>
  <li>Want you to make meaningful contributions to the product</li>
  <li>Want a healthy team dynamic</li>
  <li>Want you to voice concerns and observations as relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more</p>
      <h2 id="a-primary-goal-for-an-early-career-software-developer-telegraph-low-liability">
        
        
          A Primary-goal for an early-career software developer: Telegraph Low Liability <a href="#a-primary-goal-for-an-early-career-software-developer-telegraph-low-liability">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>First, when I say <code>telegraph low liability</code> I mean it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphing_(sports)">sports definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In sporting terminology, to <strong>telegraph</strong> is to unintentionally alert an opponent to one’s immediate situation or intentions. The sporting use of the term <em>telegraph</em> draws a direct comparison with the communication device of the same name. “Telegraphing” always refers to a reflexive physical action rather than a protracted or intellectual give-away. For example, a boxer rotating his shoulders to throw a hook would be telegraphing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should aim to “telegraph” that you’re a low-liability hire <em>without ever saying it so explicitely</em>. It’s a subtle thing, best communicated incidentally, not directly.</p>

<p>Five years ago, I wrote <a href="https://josh.works/so-you-want-to-work-remotely">So you want to work remotely…</a></p>

<p>Quoting myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there’s the matter of framing how you go about working remotely. Obviously you want to work remotely, but put yourself in the shoes of a prospective employer. They don’t care if you work remotely or not - they want you to do great work for them and make them an effective, profitable organization.</p>

  <p>Companies that hire remotely tend to be younger, agile-er, and smaller. So every employee matters. Making a bad hire can be catastrophic in terms of money and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. Your job is to make it very, very obvious that hiring YOU is a great decision. In fact, you want to be so good at what you do that passing up on you is a terrible decision.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>When you can walk someone down the path from “Hire me” to “I’ll help you make <code>$x00,000/year</code> more than you would otherwise”, <em>you’re talking their language</em>. You’re <em>telegraphing</em> that you understand their concerns without ever stating their concern explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To bring it full circle, here’s how I would go about <em>drafting</em> a CEO’s Letter of Recommendation <em>for me</em>. If you find this idea uncomfortable, don’t worry about it. That’s a sign of psychological health, that you don’t love putting flattering words <em>about yourself</em> into other people’s mouths.</p>
      
    

<p>Normally, that’s a good aversion to have. For this particular situation, you’ll have to bite the bullet and move on. I’m not going to give you the actual words (how could I?) but I’ll explain my process. I’ll include comments throughout:</p>
      <h3 id="1-draft-the-openingclosing">

<p>This is the first uncomfortable sentence you’ll have to write:</p>

        <p id="article-description">How to avoid buying your bike again every 6-12
        months and tips for how to apply the same reasoning to other things, like
        computers</p>
        <hr>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/solitary-wheel.jpeg" alt="a solitary wheel left behind after the rest of the bike was nicked">
            <figcaption>
                Rucksack Rupert strikes again
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some very commonly repeated advice on preventing someone from nicking your
        bike:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Buy a good [~10% of bicycle value] lock, ideally one with a high
            "SoldSecure" rating and lock your bicycle somewhere inside the rear
            triangle and the rear wheel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've seen this advice repeated in cycling magazines, in quality newspapers,
        sometimes even by the police and of course on internet forums.</p>
        <p>The above would imply that if you own a £400 bicycle (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/395884/bicycle-average-prices-in-the-european-union-eu-by-country/">a
        typical price in the UK</a>) you'd buy a £40 lock and put it in the right
        place.</p>
        <p>However, it is a cold fact that a cordless angle grinder can defeat any
        bicycle lock, no matter how expensive (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywN558dJaU&amp;t=198">see this video for a
        demonstration</a>). You can buy a used cordless angle grinder on eBay for less
        than £100. Even U-locks - traditionally thought to be the strongest type of
        lock - are opened in seconds with a sub-£100 angle grinder.</p>
        <p>There is other advice floating around of doubtful value, for example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Add your bicycle to a national register</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But cases where BikeRadar manage to reunite bicycles with their owners seem
        to be the exception rather than the rule. Probably this is because, as with
        cars, the first thing you do with a stolen bicycle is take it across a border
        to somewhere different.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lock your bicycle inside a secure building or place, away from sight</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This prevents opportunistic theft but if this space is shared with others
        (apartment blocks and offices) it in fact serves to increase the economies of
        scale for prepared thieves who break into your storage area late at night with
        a van. It's not uncommon for office bicycle stores (with many fancy, expensive
        bikes inside) to be emptied out completely overnight by professional
        thieves.</p>
        <h2>A threat model, by user persona</h2>
        <p>I think the advice above is poor because it doesn't come from a systematic
        consideration of the problem <em>from the point of view of thieves</em>.</p>
        <p>To come up with better advice requires a threat model, which is a piece of
        jargon for taking a holistic view of the danger posed by attackers. I think one
        of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do threat modelling is by
        <em>user persona</em>, whereby you consider each kind of attacker in turn,
        making some reasonable assumptions about their level of motivation and
        methods.</p>
        <p>As far as bicycle theft is concerned there are three basic types of
        thief.</p>
        <h3>"No-tools Nigel", the rank opportunist</h3>
        <p>Nigel has just his two hands and is simply looking for a ride home or maybe
        something he can sell to a friend for some quick cash.</p>
        <p>Nigel will steal any unlocked bicycle.</p>
        <p>Nigel is also able to take any bicycle parts that can be removed without
        tools. That means any quick-release wheels or thumbscrew saddles. In an urban
        area your parked bicycle may be passed by a Nigel as often as a few times an
        hour so anything that is not bolted down won't last very long.</p>
        <h3>"Rucksack Rupert", the thief with a few hand tools</h3>
        <p>Rupert has a small pair of shears; 4, 5 and 6mm Allen keys and a 15mm
        spanner for wheel nuts.</p>
        <p>Rupert will make his way through cable locks with his shears. If there is a
        valuable part that can be removed with hand tools he will take it. He is
        particularly keen on premium saddles and name brand wheels.</p>
        <h3>"Powertool Percy", the professional with a complete set of tools</h3>
        <p>Percy has a small collection of electric and air tools including an angle
        grinder as well as bolt-cutters and an air-jack. He has access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(criminal)">criminal fences</a> which he
        can use to sell stolen bicycles quickly. Percy often arrives in his van and
        this allows him to steal multiple bikes at once.</p>
        <p>No bicycle is safe from Percy. No lock can hold against his angle grinder.
        Often he finds if he's wearing a hi-vis jacket he can even get away with using
        his power tools in broad daylight. He's willing to chance that if the bicycle
        seems valuable enough.</p>
        <h2>Coming up with better advice based on Nigel, Rupert and Percy</h2>
        <p>In order to keep your bicycle safe you need to take steps against all three
        levels of imaginary thieves.</p>
        <p>"No-tools Nigel" will be warded off simply by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locking your bicycle whenever you leave it - even if just for a
            minute</li>
            <li>Ensuring you leave nothing on your bicycle that can be removed without
            tools
                <ul>
                    <li>replace quick-release wheel skewers with bolts</li>
                    <li>take your lights with you when you park in public</li>
                    <li>make sure your saddle is not on a thumbscrew</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Rucksack Rupert" will be deterred by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not using a cable lock!</li>
            <li>Making sure that nothing good can be removed from your bicycle with
            hand tools
                <ul>
                    <li>Lock both wheels <em>and the frame</em> to the bike stand -
                    don't rely on bolts</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Powertool Percy" will be kept at bay by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nothing, save ensuring that your bicycle doesn't look valuable enough
            to be worth his time
                <ul>
                    <li>this probably means keeping its value down below a few hundred
                    pounds</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The virtue of the "bicycle shaped object"</h2>
        <p>Valuable bicycles (&gt;£1000) have an extremely short half-life in urban
        areas. The sad truth is that the Percys of the world are common enough and
        resourceful enough that a bicycle worth over a thousand pounds isn't really
        safe anywhere in a large town. <strong>This includes most e-bikes.</strong> You
        might notice that cycle couriers who have e-bikes tend to eat lunch while
        looking directly at their locked e-bike, so that it never goes out of their
        sight. Few people in other lines of work can do the same.</p>
        <p>If the tyres are inflated, my own commuter bicycle is probably worth £30 to
        the right buyer. My bicycle is so low-end that cycling snobs refer to it as a
        mere "bicycle shaped object". Rather selfishly I am glad that such snobs exist
        as having a lot of more valuable bicycles around provides me with good ambient
        security. No thief is going to bother cutting my locks when there is a
        Campagnolo on the next rack.</p>
        <p>One father I know had his primary-school-age daughter "decorate" his
        commuting bicycle with girly stickers and pink glitter. If anyone examines his
        bicycle closely he looks like a complete loon but I think his motivation is
        right: it's going to be much less appealing to steal when it's covered in Miffy
        stickers.</p>
        <h3>Insurance - not usually worth it</h3>
        <p>What about bicycle insurance? It's fairly expensive here in the UK, usually
        10-15% of the bicycle's value annually and insurers typically only pay out when
        the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you're on your
        own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often
        these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you're
        chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.</p>
        <h2>Lists of "best practices" vs having your own threat model</h2>
        <p>The same thing goes for securing your bicycle as for securing other things:
        pat, concrete pieces of security advice are something to treat with a bit of
        doubt.</p>
        <p>In bicycles the common mantra is "spend 10% on a lock" but in computing the
        mantras are slogans such as "use a strong password", "back up your important
        data" or "use encryption" but these can all be just as vapid.</p>
        <p>"Strong passwords!" as a slogan fails to address the fact that the average
        internet user has hundreds of logins for various sites (my own password manager
        has over 700 sites recorded). The majority of internet users decide on a single
        "strong password" and then use it everywhere. They are only a single bad
        sysadmin or javascript injection away from losing access to every account on
        every website they have.</p>
        <p>Backing up your important data is only an aid to your security if the backup
        is stored as securely as the original. Much user data is stolen or exposed
        through poorly secured backups on shared fileservers. A huge number of people
        have passport and utility bill scans in their Dropbox - again, behind the same
        email and password they use everywhere. Companies can be surprisingly sloppy
        with backups too: often dumped into cloud storage somewhere once before the Big
        Migration and never removed.</p>
        <p>Encryption is troublesome as it can give undue confidence that can backfire
        spectacularly: a quarter of a million American diplomatic cables were
        inadvertantly published in unredacted form when a Guardian journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:_Inside_Julian_Assange%27s_War_on_Secrecy">
        included the password for an widely-distributed encrypted file in his book</a>.
        Apparently he thought the file's password was somehow temporary. It wasn't.</p>
        <p>Instead of following such "best practices" it's much more intellectually
        robust to <strong>come up with your own threat model</strong> - then you can
        decide your own concrete steps instead of just following the security steps of
        others which might be inapplicable or even wrong.</p>

<br/>
August 31, 2020 | https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/blog/2020/08/first-impressions-github-codespaces.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/blog/2020/08/first-impressions-github-codespaces.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>Github recently launched their new <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Github codespaces</a> service - an online, in-browser Integrated Development Environment powered by <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. This environment allows someone to quickly load a virtual machine and a complete code editing interface, that is all accessible within the browser without having to install anything on the users machine. If you are familiar with products like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Amazon Web Services’s Cloud 9 IDE</a> or its predecessor C9.io this will probably feel very familiar.</p>

<p>As one of the lucky few who were given access to the GitHub Codespaces beta program I had the opportunity to test it out and offer my thoughts on behalf of the Aristotle team below.</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p>There were a few small changes that needed to be done to the <a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Aristotle Metadata home page</a>, (including making this blogpost) and it was easy opening a Codespace to start working. Opening a code space for a project is literally as easy as GitHub says - click “Open in Codespace” on a repository and it does the rest - no need to configuring or decommission a server, its all handled for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-opening-project.png" alt="How to open Codespaces" title="How to open Codespaces"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Our website</a> is a basic <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site, and offers a great basic test of whats available in Codespaces already. Loading a fresh Codespace took less than 2 minutes, which is comparable to AWS Cloud9. As someone who used Cloud9 when it was still C9.io, Codespaces reminded me a lot of that - its a simple way to open an editor and a virtual machine for a GitHub project.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces">documentation for Codespaces</a> is also great. What I didn’t know is that GitHub can also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account">load your dotfiles directly into each new Codespace</a>, so your preferences (<code>.bashrc</code> and similar files) will follow you across Codespaces.</p>

<h2 id="editing-files">Editing files</h2>
<p>Being based on Visual Studio Code, <strong>Yes, Codespaces has a Dark Mode</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-dark-editor.png" alt="Default Codespaces Editor" title="Default Codespaces Editor"></p>

<p>Although if you are using different browsers to open your workspace (which I had to do for reasons below), your colour scheme preferences won’t follow you across browsers. I’m not a regular user of Visual Studio Code, but it seems to includes all the standard features you expect from a browser, such as syntax highlighting, VIm and Emac keybindings (which work very well in browser), and autosave which is enabled by default, and I promptly disabled.</p>

<p>You can also drag-and-drop files from your local machine into Codespaces filesystem, and preview and edit certain non-text files in the browser, such as images, both of which are really handy for web development.</p>

<h2 id="terminal-emulator">Terminal emulator</h2>
<p>Codespaces includes a powerful terminal editor that seems to be based on a stock Debian image. The only thing I didn’t like is that separate terminals are accessed using a dropdown instead of with tabs, but this is a minor detail.</p>

<p><strong>Big news: Docker is here</strong>, and it works well.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-docker.png" alt="Docker in Codespaces" title="Docker in Codespaces"></p>

<p>One of my biggest issues with C9.io was the lack of Docker support, which was solved when AWS bought Cloud9 but comes with the extra complexity of configuring your Amazon machine. So being able to simply run Docker in the browser is great. Docker-compose isn’t installed by default, and I haven’t had a chance to see how that works.</p>

<p>The only issue I found with the terminal emulator was you can only paste with right-click into Chromium-based browsers like Chrome or Edge, <em>Firefox users beware</em>.</p>

<h2 id="serving-sites">Serving sites</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace">Codepsaces does a great job of handling port forwarding for you </a>, so you can simply start you server process (on a non-Port 80 port) and if GitHub detects a <code>localhost:PORT</code> combination it makes it accessible for you by clicking on the URL, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-jekyll.png" alt="Jekyll in Codespaces" title="Jekyll in Codespaces"></p>

<p>Loading and reloading Jekyll was fast, and by the time I clicked the forwarded link or switched tabs to preview changes to the site, it was already refreshed. 
<del><strong>However, this is another Chromium-only feature the clikcable port forward links don’t work in Firefox</strong></del>  this seems to be fixed now in Firefox.</p>

<p>One other minor issue is you can’t open your site in a private window or different browser to view the server without logging into GitHub. This isn’t a huge issue, but if you are trying to view what your site looks like under different browser or when logged out it can be troublesome.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-final-site.png" alt="Aristotle Home Page in Codespaces" title="Aristotle Home Page in Codespaces"></p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p><strong>This is amazing</strong> and may become my default IDE - as a co-founder who is spending less time as a developer, and more time in meetings, writing emails, strategy papers, letters and tenders, <em>this is just amazing</em>! Most of my daily tools are Windows based, so I’ve been spending a lot of time getting Windows Subsystem for Linux working alongside the rest of my daily workflow, which comes with its own headaches. So being able to quickly checkout a branch, make changes and take some load of my local machine seems very promising.</p>

<p>There are a lot of features here to review that I haven’t had a chance to look at, including collaborative workspaces, Git integration and connecting with a local version of Visual Studio, but from a quick glance everything works smoothly.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s an extremely quick way to get started on a project, and I look forward to writing an update after I’ve had a chance getting the Aristotle Metadata Registry software, with all its many dependencies, running in codespaces under Docker-compose.</p>

<p><strong>The Aristotle Metadata Registry is no stranger to cloud innovation</strong>. If you want to learn how to access a cloud-hosted metadata registry as simple as Github’s Codespaces <a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/contact.html">get in contact with us</a>.</p>

    <p>I watched the talk
“<a href="https://vimeo.com/230142234">Platform as a Reflection of Values: Joyent, Node.js and beyond</a>”
by Bryan Cantrill, and I think he was able to put into words something I already
felt for some time: if there’s no piece of software out there that reflects your
values, it’s time for you to build that software<sup id="fnref:talk-time" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:talk-time">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I kind of agree with what he said, because this is already happening to me. I
long for a database with a certain set of values, and for a few years I was just
waiting for someone to finally write it. After watching his talk, Bryan is
saying to me: “time to stop waiting, and start writing it yourself”.</p>

<p>So let me try to give an overview of such database, and go over its values.</p>



<p>I want a database that allows me to create decentralized client-side
applications that can sync data.</p>

<p>The best one-line description I can give right now is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s sort of like PouchDB, Git, Datomic, SQLite and Mentat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A more descriptive version could be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An embedded, immutable, syncable relational database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s go over what I mean by each of those aspects one by one.</p>



<p>I think the server-side database landscape is diverse and mature enough for
my needs (even though I end up choosing SQLite most of the time), and what I’m
after is a database to be embedded on client-side applications itself, be it
desktop, browser, mobile, etc.</p>

<p>The purpose of such database is not to keep some local cache of data in case of
lost connectivity: we have good solutions for that already. It should serve as
the source of truth, and allow the application to work on top of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html"><strong>SQLite</strong></a> is a great example of that: it is a very powerful
relational database that runs <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html">almost anywhere</a>. What I miss
from it that SQLite doesn’t provide is the ability to run it on the browser:
even though you could compile it to WebAssembly, <del>it assumes a POSIX filesystem
that would have to be emulated</del><sup id="fnref:posix-sqlite" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:posix-sqlite">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pouchdb.com/"><strong>PouchDB</strong></a> is another great example: it’s a full reimplementation of
<a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> that targets JavaScript environments, mainly the browser and
Node.js. However I want a tool that can be deployed anywhere, and not limit its
applications to places that already have a JavaScript runtime environment, or
force the developer to bundle a JavaScript runtime environment with their
application. This is true for GTK+ applications, command line programs, Android
apps, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mentat"><strong>Mentat</strong></a> was an interesting project, but its reliance on SQLite
makes it inherit most of the downsides (and benefits too) of SQLite itself.</p>

<p>Having such a requirement imposes a different approach to storage: we have to
decouple the knowledge about the intricacies of storage from the usage of
storage itself, so that a module (say query processing) can access storage
through an API without needing to know about its implementation. This allows
the database to target a POSIX filesystems storage API and an IndexedDB storage
API, and make the rest of the code agnostic about storage. PouchDB has such
mechanism (called <a href="https://pouchdb.com/adapters.html">adapters</a>) and Datomic has them too (called
<a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/storage.html">storage services</a>).</p>

<p>This would allow the database to adapt to where it is embedded: when targeting
the browser the IndexedDB storage API would provide the persistence layer
that the database requires, and similarly the POSIX filesystem storage API would
provide the persistence layer when targeting POSIX systems (like desktops,
mobile, etc.).</p>

<p>But there’s also an extra restriction that comes from by being embedded: it
needs to provide and embeddable artifact, most likely a binary library object
that exposes a C compatible FFI, similar to
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html">how SQLite does</a>. Bundling a full runtime environment is
possible, but doesn’t make it a compelling solution for embedding. This rules
out most languages, and leaves us with C, Rust, Zig, and similar options that
can target POSIX systems and WebAssembly.</p>



<p>Being immutable means that only new information is added, no in-place update
ever happens, and nothing is ever deleted.</p>

<p>Having an immutable database presents us with similar trade-offs found in
persistent data structures, like lack of coordination when doing reads, caches
being always coherent, and more usage of space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.datomic.com/"><strong>Datomic</strong></a> is the go to database example of this: it will only add
information (datoms) and allows you to query them in a multitude of ways. Stuart
Halloway calls it “accumulate-only” over “append-only”<sup id="fnref:accumulate-only" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:accumulate-only">3</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s accumulate-only, it is not append-only. So append-only, most people when
they say that they’re implying something physical about what happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also a database can be append-only and overwrite existing information with new
information, by doing clean-ups of “stale” data. I prefer to adopt the
“accumulate-only” naming and approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/"><strong>Git</strong></a> is another example of this: new commits are always added on top
of the previous data, and it grows by adding commits instead of replacing
existing ones.</p>

<p>Git repositories can only grow in size, and that is not only an acceptable
condition, but also one of the reasons to use it.</p>

<p>All this means that no in-place updates happens on data, and the database will
be much more concerned about how compact and efficiently it stores data than how
fast it does writes to disk. Being embedded, the storage limitation is either a)
how much storage the device has or b) how much storage was designed for the
application to consume. So even though the database could theoretically operate
with hundreds of TBs, a browser page or mobile application wouldn’t have access
to this amount of storage. SQLite even <a href="https://sqlite.org/limits.html">says</a> that it does
support approximately 280 TBs of data, but those limits are untested.</p>

<p>The upside of keeping everything is that you can have historical views of your
data, which is very powerful. This also means that applications should turn this
off when not relevant<sup id="fnref:no-history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:no-history">4</a></sup>.</p>



<p>This is a frequent topic when talking about offline-first solutions. When
building applications that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can fully work offline,</li>
  <li>stores data,</li>
  <li>propagates that data to other application instances,</li>
</ul>

<p>then you’ll need a conflict resolution strategy to handle all the situations
where different application instances disagree. Those application instances
could be a desktop and a browser version of the same application, or the same
mobile app in different devices.</p>

<p>A three-way merge seems to be the best approach, on top of which you could add
application specific conflict resolution functions, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pick the change with higher timestamp;</li>
  <li>if one change is a delete, pick it;</li>
  <li>present the diff on the screen and allow the user to merge them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some databases try to make this “easy”, by choosing a strategy for you, but I’ve
found that different applications require different conflict resolution
strategies. Instead, the database should leave this up to the user to decide,
and provide tools for them to do it.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)"><strong>Three-way merges in version control</strong></a> are the best example,
performing automatic merges when possible and asking the user to resolve
conflicts when they appear.</p>

<p>The unit of conflict for a version control system is a line of text. The
database equivalent would probably be a single attribute, not a full entity or a
full row.</p>

<p>Making all the conflict resolution logic be local should allow the database to
have encrypted remotes similar to how <a href="https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/git-remote-gcrypt/">git-remote-gcrypt</a>
adds this functionality to Git. This would enable users to sync the application
data across devices using an untrusted intermediary.</p>



<p>I want the power of relational queries on the client applications.</p>

<p>Most of the arguments against traditional table-oriented relational databases
are related to write performance, but those don’t apply here. The bottlenecks
for client applications usually aren’t write throughput. Nobody is interested in
differentiating between 1 MB/s or 10 MB/s when you’re limited to 500 MB total.</p>

<p>The relational model of the database could either be based on SQL and tables
like in SQLite, or maybe <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query.html">datalog</a> and <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/whatis/data-model.html#datoms">datoms</a> like in
Datomic.</p>



<p>Now let’s try to translate the aspects above into values, as suggested by Bryan
Cantrill.</p>



<p>Being able to target so many different platforms is a bold goal, and the
embedded nature of the database demands portability to be a core value.</p>



<p>When the local database becomes the source of truth of the application, it must
provide consistency guarantees that enables applications to rely on it.</p>



<p>The database should empower applications to slice and dice the data in any way
it wants to.</p>



<p>Since I can’t find any database that fits these requirements, I’ve finally come
to terms with doing it myself.</p>

<p>It’s probably going to take me a few years to do it, and making it portable
between POSIX and IndexedDB will probably be the biggest challenge. I got myself
a few books on databases to start.</p>

<p>I wonder if I’ll ever be able to get this done.</p>
