<p>After publishing the URU Key project people keep asking me to make it open source. I have tried to organize sources in a more readable way but I still think that plain C and ESP IDF are too difficult for the broad audience. And, unfortunately, the biometrics part is covered by NDA and can not be published.</p>
<p>Therefore I am starting a new project to address these and other issues.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-form-factor">Size and form factor</h2>
<p>A few months ago I have finalized the <a href="https://en.ovcharov.me/2020/04/06/uru-key-final-hardware-design/">URU Key hardware design</a> and started working on housing for it. Yes, it is very small and lightweight but carrying it around is a kind of a problem. The device is too fragile to be worn on the keyring and a bit thick to put in the pocket. The necklace is not my style.</p>

<p>However, my wallet is always with me. The PCB sized as a standard credit card should perfectly fit there. The power source becomes a problem, that’s true. But, wait, is it difficult to find a charger or power bank with Micro USB nowadays?</p>

<p>The name <strong>URU Card</strong> makes a lot of sense for this project, isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User interface</h2>
<p>As on one hand, I can not use biometrics for open source project and on other hand, I do not want to omit the authentication completely leaving the device insecure there is a need for some form of user verification. Simple touch keyboard and OLED screen should allow people to enter pin code or password.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421c686c17665f43cfbb25fd3059190a055e4ae5/b0f7c/uploads/resized/uru-card-2-w800.jpg" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421c686c17665f43cfbb25fd3059190a055e4ae5/b0f7c/uploads/resized/uru-card-2-w800.jpg" data-srcset="/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w150.jpg 150w, /uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w300.jpg 300w, /uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w600.jpg 600w, /uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w800.jpg 800w, /uploads%2F2020%2F06%2F29%2Furu-card-2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 150px, (max-width: 380px) 300px, (max-width: 680px) 600px, (max-width: 880px) 800px, 1200px" alt="URU Card - touch keyboard and OLED screen" title="URU Card - touch keyboard and OLED screen" srcset="https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w150.jpg 150w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w300.jpg 300w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w600.jpg 600w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w800.jpg 800w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2F2020%2F06%2F29%2Furu-card-2.jpg 1200w"><figcaption>URU Card - touch keyboard and OLED screen</figcaption></figure>
<p>The keyboard should be implemented with the <strong>MPR121</strong> I2C touch-sensor controller, and the screen is a widely available <strong>OLED</strong> screen with the <strong>SSD1306</strong> controller. The screen is placed in the special cut in the PCB keeping the device thickness below 2 millimetres.</p>
<h2 id="framework-for-the-development">Framework for the development</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the <strong>Arduino</strong> framework is ported to the <strong>ESP32</strong> platform. There are hundreds of libraries for almost every use case and this factor should significantly simplify the project. There are libraries for <strong>ATECC508A</strong>, <strong>MPR121</strong> and <strong>SSD1306</strong> already. All that is needed is to wire everything together.</p>
<p>However, the Arduino IDE will be hardly usable for a project complex like this one. I am going to use Visual Studio Code + <strong>PlatformIO</strong> for the development and recommend others to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-the-project">The current state of the project</h2>
<p>At the moment the working <strong>BLE server</strong> with <strong>FIDO2</strong> endpoints is implemented. The device is “visible” and the computer connects to it in order to perform an authentication procedure. However, the commands are not implemented yet - it’s going to be the next step.</p>

<p>There is a PCB design as well and you can try to build the device, but do it on your own risk - it’s in a very early stage now.</p>
<h2 id="joining-the-project">Joining the project</h2>
<p>Sweetest part. The project is free to join for everyone. The minimal requirement is just an ESP32 development board like the one below.</p>

      <p><time datetime="2020-06-27 00:00:00 +0000">27 Jun 2020</time></p><p>Having your application produce the right amount and quality of logs will help you debug faster, optimize better and keep your data safe and secure. I was always fascinated with logging and tried to figure out the best ways to log and create telemetry for my applications.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to work with multiple startups, I came into close contact with all of Node.js’ major logging packages. Lately, I had the luck to work with highly security aware businesses, for whom security is an existential threat. When tasked with the challenge of creating secure applications for them, I knew without hesitation that I had to create a new library to meet all the new requirements that were at play.</p>

<p>I want to introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a>, a versatile and powerful logger for Node.js.</p>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/planning.jpg" alt="Logging Flow"></p>

<h2 id="the-logging-requirements">The Logging Requirements</h2>

<p>These are the logging requirements that were on the drawing board when Logality was first implemented. I could find some of them in some packages, but not all of them in one package:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#a-common-logging-schema"><strong>Complete Flexibility on Properties</strong></a>. In order for my organization to have a common logging schema, it is required of the logging library to allow the definition of properties from scratch. A lot of the packages make those decisions for you leaving you with no options to normalize the logging schema. The most common example for this is the date field, you can find it as <code>dt</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>timestamp</code> or any other variance, without any option to change the name.</li>
  <li><a href="#serializers-of-data-objects"><strong>Serializers of Data Objects</strong></a>. As <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> is primarily a JSON logger, dealing with data is the most common operation. Being able to serialize known data structures is key in this case. Just drop your user data object to logality and the built-in or your custom serializer will make sure to transform the object so only what you want will be logged.</li>
  <li><a href="#custom-output-and-pretty-print"><strong>Support Custom Outputs</strong></a>. Logality’s Default output is JSON but the library should not limit you as to the kind of output you want, for instance print human readable logs while on development. Custom outputs also allow you to filter log messages so you can suppress dynamically certain types or log levels of messages.</li>
  <li><a href="#logging-metadata"><strong>Logging Metadata</strong></a>. Have the logger automatically log the location of the file that the log originated from. As well as other useful system information (OS version, runtime info, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="#the-power-of-middleware"><strong>Middleware Support</strong></a>. Supporting middleware is a very powerful way to transform and augment each one of your log messages. The options that this feature opens up are endless.</li>
  <li><a href="#linking-multiple-logality-instances"><strong>Logging for Libraries</strong></a>. All open source contributors must have faced this challenge at least once: How do I output logs from my library? This is no easy task, Logality provides an eloquent and powerful solution to this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these requirements in place, <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> was created on May 18, 2018. Ever since then the library has been iteratively improving and bug fixed. Today, the current Version is 3.0.0, which was released on April of 2020. In the following sections, we will go through a more detailed analysis of the features and powerful capabilities of Logality.</p>

<h2 id="a-common-logging-schema">A Common Logging Schema</h2>

<p>The more standardized your log messages are, the easier it will be to query, parse and subsequently analyze them. Consequently, your log messages need to have a schema. As we all know, the most ubiquitous format for text based serialization today, is JSON.</p>

<p>Logality is a JSON logger that provides an initial recommendation of a logging schema but allows you to define your own schemas down to the last property.</p>

<p>This is a very important feature. When you are trying to have a common logging schema across multiple operating systems, platforms and programming languages, it is essential that your tooling allows you to be flexible and versatile.</p>

<p>Schema mutation in Logality happens through <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> and <a href="#serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers</a>, both of which we touch on below.</p>



<p>Logality will take care of all your metadata needs so you won’t need to log any additional information. In particular, Logality will automatically resolve and log for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The location of the file where the log originated from.</li>
  <li>The hostname of the machine that runs the application.</li>
  <li>The process id.</li>
  <li>The process name.</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple <code>log.info('hello world')</code> log will produce the following log message (expanded):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"severity"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"level"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"info"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"dt"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2018-05-18T16:25:57.815Z"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"message"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello world"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"event"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"context"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"runtime"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"application"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"testLogality"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"source"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>"file_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/test/spec/surface.test.js"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"system"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"hostname"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"localhost"</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"pid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>36255</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"process_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"node ."</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the use of <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> you can create and attach your own metadata on each one of your log messages.</p>

<h2 id="serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers of Data Objects</h2>

<p>As standardization of logging data is a primary requirement for Logality, serializers were introduced to solve the problem of consistently logging known data objects.</p>

<p>Let’s take for example the User Data Object (UDO) and the action of logging in, you could log the event as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>`User </span><span>${</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>}</span><span> logged in`</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But that is not a JSON log message, that is a string log message and it is not easily query-able. Let’s try this again with Logality’s JSON logging feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>User logged in</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>user</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we passed the UDO to logality, however, Logality has no instruction of what portions of the UDO we want logged and here is where serializers come in. Serializers are simple functions that take the objects that you pass as input and output the properties that you want to have logged.</p>

<p>This way, you standardize how your models are logged across your infrastructure and protect your system from logging sensitive fields like a user’s password or unnecessary information like meta data of a product.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-middleware">The Power of Middleware</h2>

<p>Logality introduces middleware which allows you to manipulate and mutate the logging messages as you see fit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>((</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Remove user data object from logging</span>
    <span>delete</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>user</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Add debugging flag on all messages</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>debug</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Middleware, you can create powerful data flows, augmenting log messages as they come in with rich metadata information collected from the environment and runtime.</p>

<p>You can also have conditional transformations of the data that pass through logality for absolute control over the data flows and your compliance requirements.</p>

<h2 id="linking-multiple-logality-instances">Linking Multiple Logality Instances</h2>

<p>As an open source contributor, one of the biggest problems I have been challenged with is how to log on open source libraries. If you want to have logging on your library you are challenged with quite a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide an option to turn off logging.</li>
  <li>Provide a way to filter the logging level.</li>
  <li>How do you format the logs according to your downstream application’s standards?</li>
  <li>Should you log to stdout, an event or a function?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are very challenging problems, to the point where no practical solution exists. Until today that is, as Logality introduces piping. You can pipe one Logality instance into another and have all the middleware functions handle the piped logality’s log messages. When Logality is piped, the log messages get passed as pure data objects so that the downstream consuming function can properly parse and manipulate them.</p>

<p>This is huge as it enables your application to granularly control how much information is logged from the libraries you are using. And at the same time have your third-party libraries log in the exact same format-schema that your entire infrastructure is logging. Isn’t that great?</p>

<p>Piping happens simply by providing the child Logality instance to the parent’s <code>pipe()</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>thirdPartyLibrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>thirdparty</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>applicationLogality</span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>thirdPartyLibrary</span><span>.</span><span>logality</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="custom-output-and-pretty-print">Custom Output and Pretty Print</h2>

<p>Finally, after all the processing the log message has gone through, you can control how the final serialization and output is handled. By default Logality will JSON serialize and output to stdout but you may have other plans.</p>

<p>This operation also enables you to filter certain log messages based on your custom criteria. This is particularly useful when managing multiple log streams from various upstreams (third-party libraries) that are piping their logs to your main application Logality logger.</p>

<p>Logality also offers a built-in pretty print functionality that, as the word suggests, will print the log messages in a human readable format, with nice colors, emojis and all. This is particularly useful when you are developing the application and don’t want to see JSON serialized log messages.</p>

<h3 id="outline-of-logalitys-lifecycle-and-piping">Outline of Logality’s Lifecycle and Piping</h3>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/logality-lifecycle-outline.svg" alt="Logality Lifecycle Outline"></p>

<h2 id="synchronous-or-asynchronous">Synchronous or Asynchronous?</h2>

<p>With a flick of a switch you can have Logality become asynchronous and reveal its Promise API. When in async mode, Logality’s Middleware and Custom Output functions will be able to handle a promise and allow you to capture log messages en-route.</p>

<p>Say you want to push all log messages to a queue, or for any reason, you want to store some, or all, of the log messages into your database. By enabling async mode on Logality you can easily and safely perform those tasks:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Security middleware for logality, store the log message</span>
<span>// in our database as well and send it to our queue for</span>
<span>// further processing and alerting</span>
<span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>security</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>// login failed, log it</span>
<span>await</span> <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>warn</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Login Failed</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>security</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you rightfully observed, when async mode is enabled Logality’s logging is, well, async, and thus returns a promise that needs to be resolved. Therefore, that is why you see the <code>await</code> before the <code>log.warn()</code> invocation.</p>

<p>Personally, my use case for using async mode and secondary data stores <a href="https://srop.co/" title="SROP The Secure Drop">at SROP</a> was for auditing log trails. When an audit log event occurred, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>When casting from YouTube to a Chromecast, sometimes the audio playback will <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/13807879?hl=en">skip</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/17251626?hl=en">stutter</a>. This issue is independent of the quality of the video, the FPS, or the internet connection. Trying to watch certain videos will reliably cause playback issues on the Chromecast.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/13807879">this thread</a>, the playback issue only appeared in the latest and final firmware update for the Chromecast. Successful playback of the videos was possible in the past, and casting the downloaded YouTube videos eliminates the problem entirely. The problem exists solely when casting certain videos using the YouTube app.</p>  <p>Given that the problem only occurs with the YouTube app, you can download a video and cast it via <a href="https://github.com/xat/castnow"><code>castnow</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt"><code>catt</code></a>, skipping the YouTube app entirely.</p> <p>You could do something like:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg"</span>

<span>function </span>cast<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
    
    <span>filename</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>youtube-dl <span>--get-filename</span> <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    youtube-dl <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
    
    <span># wait a bit to download the file</span>
    castnow <span>"</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
    <span>rm</span> <span>"</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

cast <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But having to skip using the YouTube app to cast is already a clunky solution, and downloading every video before playing them is an even worse user experience. Instant playback and ephemeral streams are what make for a pleasant video streaming experience in 2020, and this solution implements neither of them</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md">Since <code>youtube-dl</code> allows us to output to <code>stdout</code></a>, if we can hook its <code>stdout</code> to a casting app, we could emulate the instant playback and ephemeral videos we expect because we don’t have to wait for an entire file to download.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <code>castnow</code> and <code>catt</code> won’t cast from <code>stdin</code>. You’re expected to pass it file locations to cast from.</p> <p>This is where one of my favorite shell features really shines: <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html">process substitution</a>.</p> <p>With process substitution, Bash gives us a convenient way to make ephemeral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe">anonymous pipes</a>. This method is both efficient and concurrent, making this primitive an apt choice to build a solution to the problem at hand. A process reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">pipe</a> blocks until the pipe is opened by another process for writing. A process writing to the pipe will suspend until the pipe’s buffer is read by another process. The anonymous pipe will automatically remove itself, and when it is manually removed, its dependent processes will be terminated.</p> <p>When using process substitution, a process’ <code>stdout</code> is hooked up to an anonymous pipe. That pipe can be accessed from a file descriptor, and the location of the pipe is given to the calling process.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
/dev/fd/63

<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
Content sent to pipe
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In the example above, the <code>&lt;(command)</code> syntax is how we invoke process substitution in Bash. The output of <code>command</code> is written to an anonymous pipe, and the calling process is given the location of the file descriptor to access that pipe.</p> <p>Using that example, we can take advantage of process substitution:</p> <div><div><pre><code>vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The command above will play the YouTube video locally with <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>, and illustrates that process substitution can work for our use case.</p> <p>However, when we try to use <code>castnow</code>, we can’t cast from the pipe:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>castnow &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: Load failed
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Nor can we cast with <code>catt</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>catt cast &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: The chosen file does not exist.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We know we can use VLC locally, and VLC also lets you cast to a Chromecast using its IP address.</p> <p>Let’s try that again using VLC:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_vlc<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

    <span># get the ip address for chromecast.lan host</span>
    <span>ip</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>dig +short chromecast.lan | <span>tail</span> <span>-n</span> 1<span>)</span>

    vlc <span>-I</span> ncurses <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout</span> <span>'#chromecast'</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout-chromecast-ip</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$ip</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--demux-filter</span><span>=</span>demux_chromecast <span>\</span>
      <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span> &lt; /dev/tty
<span>}</span>

cast_vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That works.</p> <p>As an aside, we hook VLC’s <code>stdin</code> to <code>/dev/tty</code> so that we can use the ncurses interface even if we invoke the function from a script.</p> <p>Let’s look at the <a href="https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/ncurses/">ncurses interface</a>.</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d0822203c304db88f3cbec618e94a3d9f55cd269/c5939/assets/imgs/converted/vlc-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div> <p>It only displays the file descriptor, and very little about the video itself. I’m not a fan of that.</p>  <p>Instead of using anonymous pipes, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe">named pipes</a>. Named pipes are like anonymous pipes, except they are not anonymous (they have a name) nor are they ephemeral. Named pipes still give us the efficiency and concurrency benefits that anonymous pipes give us, but Bash lacks the syntactic sugar it has for process substitution when it comes to named pipes.</p> <p>This is how we create named pipes, write to them, read from them and remove them.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkfifo </span>ourpipe
<span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content in pipe"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ourpipe &amp;
<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>ourpipe
Content <span>in </span>pipe
<span>$ </span><span>rm </span>ourpipe
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Not as pretty as <code>&lt;(command)</code>, but it gets the job done.</p> <p>We can give a named pipe the same name as our YouTube video, and that way, the VLC interface will show the name of what we’re watching.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_ytdl<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

  <span># create a temporary named pipe</span>
  <span># why? because vlc will show the file descriptor path if we just use process substitution</span>
  <span>filename</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>youtube-dl <span>--get-filename</span> <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"/tmp/</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
  <span>mkfifo</span> <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span>

  <span># download in background, push to named pipe</span>
  youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span> &amp;
  <span>pid</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$!</span><span>"</span>
  <span>disown</span> <span>$pid</span>

  <span># cast from named pipe</span>
  cast_vlc <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span>

  <span># cleanup process and named pipe</span>
  <span>kill</span> <span>-9</span> <span>"</span><span>$pid</span><span>"</span> &amp;&gt; /dev/null
<span>}</span>

cast_ytdl <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This works, too.</p> <p>We need to manually create a named pipe with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/mkfifo"><code>mkfifo</code></a>, redirect <code>youtube-dl</code>’s <code>stdout</code> to the named pipe while running the process in the background, and then cleanup the process after casting from it via VLC, otherwise it might linger in the background. Each of those tasks would have been handled for us automatically using process substitution.</p> <p>But it does look a bit better:</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/25d68fb2085191adb26bb931e9bb31c638e5a634/f664c/assets/imgs/converted/vlc3-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div>  <p>Pipes, anonymous pipes and named pipes are also known by another name because of the way they behave: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)#Pipes">FIFOs</a>, or <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>i</strong>n, <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>o</strong>ut. What’s written to the pipe is read from the pipe in first in, first out order. This behavior maps well to video streaming.</p> <p>While you can interact with anonymous and named pipes like you would a file, the interface isn’t 1:1 with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Regular_file">standard file</a>. You cannot <code>seek()</code> forward or backward in pipe, you can just read the next forward values. For our use case, that means we cannot skip forward or backward in our streaming videos. We can only play, pause or stop the video.</p> <p>That’s not a problem for me, however it’s something that can be mitigated if it’s a problem for you. The first solution I can think of would be to write to a temporary file via <code>youtube-dl</code> and read from it. Or <a href="https://alexdelorenzo.dev/programming/2019/04/14/buffer">perhaps a temporary spooled file can act as a buffer for the pipe</a>, such that you can <code>seek()</code> through the buffer, but the buffer itself is ephemeral unlike a normal file.</p> </div></div>]]>

        <p>Local economies around the U.S. have continued to change quickly and dramatically – states and cities are slowly reopening, unemployment rates are starting to decline from the recent all-time high, COVID-19 cases are increasing in some states while decreasing in others, and communities are responding to the social unrest and George Floyd protests with city-wide curfews having impacted many businesses that were just able to reopen.</p>
        <p>Yelp last reported on the state of the local economy in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q1-2020.html">our quarterly Yelp Economic Average report on April 28</a>, showing how much consumer activity in major swathes of Main Street had dropped off in just a couple of weeks in March. Now as states start to reopen and the nation responds to anti-Black racism and police brutality, a new set of challenges lay ahead for local economies.</p>

      <h2>Some Businesses Slowly Reopen, While Many Permanently Close</h2>
        <p>As of June 15, there were nearly 140,000 total business closures on Yelp since March 1. In April we reported more than 175,000 business closures, indicating that more than 20% of businesses closed in April have reopened. Las Vegas, NV, endured the highest number of closures relative to the number of businesses in the city (1,921 total closures), while Los Angeles, CA, had the largest total number of closures (11,774 total closures).</p>

        <p>Of all business closures on Yelp since March 1, 41% are permanent closures. Our data shows the largest spikes of permanent closures occurred in March, followed by May and June, indicating that the businesses that were already struggling had to permanently close right away and the businesses that were trying to hold on, but unable to weather the COVID-19 storm, were forced to shutter in recent months.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Retail and Restaurant Businesses Continue Innovating Amid High Closure Rates</h2>
        <p>While many business sectors have struggled during COVID-19 there are a few industries that have endured especially high closure rates. Among those with the highest rate of business closures are shopping and retail (27,663 closed businesses), restaurants (23,981 closed businesses), beauty (15,348 closed businesses) and fitness (5,589 closed businesses).</p>
        <p>Retail was by far the hardest hit, experiencing the highest number of total closures, with the average daily rate continuing to increase since March. Of all closures on Yelp since March 1, 20% are for retail businesses and 35% of closed retail businesses are indicated as permanent on Yelp.</p>
        <p>In March, Restaurants had the highest number of business closures, compared to other industries, and have continued to close at high rates. Of the businesses that closed, 17% are restaurants, and 53% of those restaurant closures are indicated as permanent on Yelp. Restaurants run on thin margins and can sometimes take months or even years to break even, resulting in this higher rate of permanent closures.</p>

Many restaurants pivoted to offering takeout and delivery, while some experimented with take home meal and drink kits, and even virtual cooking classes. Some are finding new ways to use existing technology, like <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.yelp.com/2020/04/use-waitlist-online-takeout-restaurants?utm_source=biz_blog&amp;utm_medium=yelp_blog&amp;utm_content=blog_text_link">Yelp Waitlist to manage curbside pickup</a>. Servicing food to-go produces high margins for restaurants, and we’ve seen a 10X increase in searches for takeout since March 10.</p>
        <p>With many retail businesses shifting to curbside pickup, we’ve seen consumer interest spike in obtaining their goods in this way with a 20% increase in searches for curbside pickup. In the beauty industry we’ve seen hair stylists offering video hair cutting tutorials, estheticians offering virtual consultations, and small shops shifting their focus to ecommerce. Fitness in particular has seen a significant shift in their business model with gyms and studios offering virtual classes and personal trainers offering one-on-one virtual training sessions. If nothing else, local businesses owners have proven themselves to be resilient and creative during these trying times.</p>

      <h2>The Desire to Support Black-Owned Businesses Continues to Grow</h2>
        <p>As acknowledgement of anti-Black racism and police brutality become more wide-spread across the nation people are continuing to look for ways to support the Black community. Since May 25, we’ve seen a 1785% relative increase in searches for Black-owned businesses, compared to the three weeks prior. Review mentions of “Black-owned” (and related terms) also skyrocketed, up 426%, as people look to support and surface these businesses to the community.</p>
        <p>D.C. had the highest number of Black-owned searches, accounting for nearly 1% of all searches on Yelp, followed by Minnesota, Maryland, Michigan and Georgia. In fact, every state has shown an increase in searches for Black-owned businesses. Looking at metros, Ann Arbor, MI has the highest increase in searches for Black-owned, up 105X (accounting for 3% of all searches), followed by Denver (up 27X), Minneapolis (up 23X) and Baltimore (up 19X).</p>

        <p>While some normal activity is starting to bounce back, due to the many changes impacting local economies — state rules, consumer behavior, and social unrest — many of the consumer interest shifts we saw in March and April started to rebound in May, with dramatic shifts in June.</p>
        <p>Outdoor activities that became popular at the height of the pandemic as people were finding ways to stay active while social distancing – such as mountain biking (down 40%), lakes (down 34%), golf (down 33%) and hiking (down 28%) – have dropped in consumer interest since May 1 relative to other active activities. People are starting to feel more comfortable participating in indoor activities, with increased consumer interest for escape games (up 182%), Go Karts (up 147%), axe throwing (up 113%), gyms (up 81%), bowling (up 63%) and yoga (42%). That said, in some instances people are still finding ways to stay outdoors while social distancing with an increased interest in mini golf (up 132%), amusement parks (up 28%) and horseback riding (up 21%).</p>
        <p>The previous spike in community supported agriculture and grocery has started to dip (down 54% and 26%, respectively) as people start heading back into restaurants. In fact, Yelp’s diners seated data shows significantly more people are dining-in at restaurants. During the peak of the pandemic, the number of diners seated across Yelp Reservations and Waitlist dropped essentially to zero. In early June, we've seen diners seated come back substantially – now down 57% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Restaurants that cater to group dining are among those making a comeback – fondue (up 123%), tapas bars (up 98%), hot pot (up 49%) and surprisingly, even buffets (up 17%) – as foods that gained increased interest through takeout and delivery have started to fall – pizza (down 28%), chinese (down 26%), fast food (down 18%). That said, takeout and delivery has continued to sustain interest on Yelp, still up 148% based on consumer interest relative to pre-pandemic levels, indicating this could be a trend that’s here to stay.</p>
        <p>People are also headed back into malls with outlet stores, shopping centers and thrift stores all up (up 84%, 81%, 72%, respectively), as well as hosting or attending formal events with increased interest in bridal (up 70%) and formal wear (up 102%). The previous increase in cannabis dispensaries, head shops and tobacco shops has declined (down 40%, 35% and 32%, respectively). There have also been significant shifts in consumer interest for health and wellness businesses with an increased interest in saunas (up 75%), reflexology (up 69%) and dentists (up 28%), while skilled nursing (down 46%) and hospitals (down 37%) decline.</p>

<p>It's no secret that finishing a side project is hard.</p>
<p>I've struggled with some side projects and had success with others. In this post, I'll focus on the actions and adjustments that have worked for me.</p>
<p>It's possible to work on and finish side projects even with a busy schedule, the key is to optimize for interruptability. You will be interrupted so instead of counting on having hours of deep work available, it's better to be realistic and make some adjustments to use available time in a better way and reducing the cost of interruptions by having tricks to switch context fast.</p>
<h2 id="a-failed-side-project-story">A failed side project story <a href="#a-failed-side-project-story">#</a></h2>
<p>Maybe you are familiar with a similar situation</p>
<p>At the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>High motivation.</li>
<li>Priority over other tasks.</li>
<li>Working long hours because it's fun.</li>
<li>Desire to work with a new technology</li>
<li>No problem working on weekends.</li>
</ul>
<p>After some time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation decreases.</li>
<li>Feels overwheelming.</li>
<li>Harder to justify working on the project when there are other responsibilities.</li>
<li>Other stuff seems more interesting now.</li>
<li>Forgot how to set things up to continue working on the project.</li>
<li>Not sure what I was working on.</li>
<li>Forgetting about the project and archiving it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-challenges-with-side-projects">The challenges with side projects <a href="#the-challenges-with-side-projects">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Context switching and high cognitive load is exhausting.</li>
<li><strong>Losing interest/ motivation</strong>.</li>
<li>Perfectionism - never ending projects.</li>
<li>Impostor syndrome.</li>
<li>Lack of focus.</li>
<li>Lack of time.</li>
<li>Unexpected life events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-framing-the-goal">Re framing the goal <a href="#re-framing-the-goal">#</a></h2>
<p>I believe you can set yourself for failure from the start if the goal is not clear.</p>
<p>I've been excited about ideas but later found that I was not really invested in the idea and just wanted to explore a cool feature/tool. It's good to go deeper to your true motivation.</p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed can also contribute to abandoning the project, I'll talk about <strong>small steps</strong> and why it's key.</p>
<p>If your track record includes lots of ambitious projects and none of them finished, then starting with something smaller seems like the logical approach.</p>
<p>Pick a small battle, maybe just the key feature first, maybe support for just one platform. Cut off features for the first version, remember that there's a lot of forces against you completing your project so reducing load is important.</p>
<h2 id="the-approach">The approach <a href="#the-approach">#</a></h2>
<p>Now that you have a clear idea of what you want to finish, there's some actions and adjustments to your process that will increase the chance of winning the battle (shipping).</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparing your environment (painless context switch)</li>
<li>Work in <strong>Small steps</strong></li>
<li>Mental warm-up before each session.</li>
<li>Anticipate and expect interruptions.</li>
<li>Changing your physical location.</li>
<li>Writting down the ideas on your mind at the end of the session.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-steps-are-key">Small steps are key <a href="#small-steps-are-key">#</a></h2>
<p>I like the idea of not having too many open boxes at the same time, where each box is a task/feature or something that you  started but haven't finished yet.</p>
<p>It's demoralizing to wait weeks or months for a win. Small steps give you small wins, it keeps the journey fun. There's less change of feeling stuck.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/06/26/more-on-small-steps/">Geepaw Hill</a> shares excellent resources on the topic of small steps in software.</p>
<h2 id="warming-up-before-each-session-to-reduce-cognitive-exhaustion">Warming up before each session to reduce cognitive exhaustion <a href="#warming-up-before-each-session-to-reduce-cognitive-exhaustion">#</a></h2>
<p>Before starting actual work, write about what would be good to achieve in the session. I find this ritual valuable as it helps me figure out the next small step. Writing the project goal (high level) every session is also a good way to switch context and reminding yourself what's it all about.</p>
<p>I'll talk about having a "context" log, where you write the current progress, and what to do next. If you have this file, reading the previous session log let's you resume your work faster.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-context-switching">Immediate context switching <a href="#immediate-context-switching">#</a></h2>
<p>With the limited amount of mental energy, is crucial to reduce the number of setup tasks required to do a working session on your project. The goal here is reducing the number of small decisions you have to make to have a working environment.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important things for me, and the way I approach it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a separated system User on my laptop.</li>
<li>Having an email address only for my project.</li>
<li>Having a "context" file where I log what's currently happening with my project, usually at the end of a work session.</li>
</ul>
<p>These have been valuable tools for me, let me explain why:</p>
<h3 id="a-separate-system-user-for-your-side-project">A separate system user for your side project <a href="#a-separate-system-user-for-your-side-project">#</a></h3>
<p>By creating a separate user, you automatically have all the operative system tools (calendar/notes/reminders , etc.) available ONLY for your project.</p>
<p>All the files on your desktop will have a relation to your project. This may not seem impressive but think about all the small distractions you find if you use the same user for your personal/work tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to find a file (filtering unrelated stuff will bring memories of other things)</li>
<li>Reminders/calendar notifications not related to your project</li>
<li>Dealing with other project setups can be stressful.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it was Seth Godin who recommended having a separate laptop for a side project like writing a book. This is an alternative too.</p>
<p>You can add more extreme measures like redirecting distracting sites like news or reddit. If you need to login to one of those sites, it's better to switch user accounts. Try to keep your project user clean.</p>
<h3 id="having-an-separate-email-for-your-project">Having an separate email for your project <a href="#having-an-separate-email-for-your-project">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://hugozap.com/posts/ultimate-info-capturing-tool/">I'm a fan of email</a> as a note taking tool, it's available everywhere, the UI is simple. Having a separate email account lets you capture related notes/ideas/links from any device. This has been useful for me when I'm doing something else and have an idea, or find a resource that can be used to do something I want to incorporate into the project.</p>
<p>Later, when I log in to my project environment I'll get the emails with relevant information, no chance of getting distracted with other stuff.</p>
<h3 id="the-context-file%2C-(brain-dump).">The context file, (brain dump). <a href="#the-context-file%2C-(brain-dump).">#</a></h3>
<p>A context file is just a text file where you add a short summary of the current project status and what's on your mind at the time.</p>
<p>This has been valuable to me, because the act of writing it down helps me have a clear idea of things I could do next and next time I have time to work on my project I'll have a starting point and it reduces the cognitive load which maximizes the session efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location <a href="#location">#</a></h2>
<p>Going to a library or café (when possible) or event to another room and have a dedicated space for your current side project will make a difference.</p>
<p>Not sure about why, but using the same desk for different work and side projects is not ideal for me. If you can I recommend having a different place that helps you switch context quickly.</p>
<h2 id="abandoned-projects-may-not-be-a-failure-after-all.">Abandoned projects may not be a failure after all. <a href="#abandoned-projects-may-not-be-a-failure-after-all.">#</a></h2>
<p>Some abandoned projects end up being an inspiration to create something else years later. Maybe you learned something new, explored an idea, or found a problem not possible to solve with the knowledge and resources you had at the time.</p>
<p>It's good to have an open mind and be ok with finding dead-ends, they are powerful teachers.</p>
<p>However, shipping projects <strong>is awesome</strong> and by reducing scope and anticipating interruptions you will be able to complete your project and release it to the world.</p>

    <p>
      To really explain why I use org-mode for <bold>everything</bold>, I probably first have to explain my rules, which also requires a backstory.  I'll keep it short, no problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jacked into Unix the first time at Calhoun Community College, in Decatur, Alabama, during the summer of 1974.  I was 15, and my dad was a part-time programming instructor.  Having been an avid reader since the age of 6 (I read the entire elementary school library before the middle of second grade), text and text-processing was much on my mind.
    </p>
    <p>So when I encountered a system where plain text is the raw material flowing through the pipes, I was hooked.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <br>
      ...what I really learned was that the rules of Unix could be adapted to life.
      </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      This led me to undertake an informal study of Unix, all the way back to the Tech Model Railroad Club and all the hackers that came from there.  Yeah, I read the story about Margaret and the groceries and the Volkswagen; I understand his pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I really learned was that the rules of Unix could be adapted to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about 30 years as a tech writer and frequent programmer, I finally settled on a set that works for me.  Little did I know that these very principles would lead me to org-mode, which would later lead me to find my people.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <center>
	Unix rules for life

    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep it simple: It's cheaper and easier to carry around.</li>
      <li>Do one thing at a time: Multitasking is a lie.</li>
      <li>Network: You were born to connect.</li>
      <li>Say what you mean; nothing is truer than the truth.</li>
      <li>Hack: Trial and error is the only way we learn anything</li>
      <li>Be who you are: Even a bent wire can carry a great light.</li>
      <li>Use leverage; a bigger hammer isn't always the answer.</li>
      <li>Use what you have: never dig diamonds with a brick of gold.</li>
      <li>Have faith; all's possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.</li>
      <li>Think ahead, but don't worship your plans; remember today is the first day of the rest of your learning experience.</li>

<h3>
  a vi convert
</h3>
<p>
  I didn't start with org-mode, actually, but with plain journal files labeled YYYYMMDD, in a special directory in <code>/var/log</code>.  I still have those going back to sometime in the 90's.  The format was simple, but using the files soon became complex:
  </p><pre>	  
    *** personal journal of stormrider
    tue, aug 04, 1992 / 712904400
    sweetmorn, confusion 70, 3158 YOLD
    
    *** fortune -s
    Cold hands, no gloves.
    
    *** appts
    09:00  staff meeting, conf rm
    18:30  dinner with amit &amp; bonnie
    
    *** to do

    .
    .
    .
    
    *** daily journal
    06:43 - man, didn't sleep well
    last night; i think i'm overdoing
    it on the coffee at work; maybe i
    should cut back some?
    .
    .
    .
  </pre>
  The unwieldy part came with all the repeated tasks, and tasks that got carried over from one day to the next (or didn't get finished). I had to copy yesterday's file, change all the key info, sort out the todo list, erase yesterday's journal, and generally do far too much work to keep my journal up.

<blockquote>

  I got turned onto emacs sometime in the mid-nineties, when I moved to Atlanta to work for HP.  A fellow writer there used it, and suggested it might help me write and code up examples more effectively.  He was right, and it stuck....
  </blockquote>
<p>
  I did it, but intermittently, supplanting it with post-it notes, pads, planners galore, palm pilots, palmtop computers, etc.  It seemed like every day I was badly copying tasks from one day to the next. Meanwhile, my unwillingness to use Windows didn't give the the luxury of Outlook, when it came along.
</p>
<p>
  I got turned onto emacs sometime in the mid-nineties, when I moved to Atlanta to work for HP.  A fellow writer there used it, and suggested it might help me write and code up examples more effectively.  He was right, and it stuck as my editing platform of choice.
</p>
<p>
But I hadn't discovered org-mode yet. Either he didn't use it, or it hadn't been invented yet.  And to be honest, I kinda went back and forth between vi and emacs, depending on my "mood of the month."
</p>
<h3>
  a modem in the woods
</h3>
<p>
  Eventually, my HP job became a telecommuting-type arrangment, and I moved home to the farm, about an hour outside New Orleans, in the woods.  At that time, Internet was still modem-driven out here, so having command-line Linux with emacs on my laptop was a real lifesaver.
</p>
<p>
  Sometime not long before Katrina hit, I stumbled across org-mode.  I'd already used outline mode for some period of time (can't remember how long), and org-mode seemed like a logical follow-on from there.
      </p>
      <p>
	From there, org-mode just grew, and I grew with it.  All the features made it easy for me to both do what seemed natural for me, and do things in a way that felt like they supported my principles.  Gradually, my other methods of keeping track of things faded away, except for my alarm clock.  </p>
<p>
  Even when smart-phones took off, I was always trying to find some way to send org files over to my phone and use them there.  I think I even wrote some lua code in an iPhone wiki app to emulate org-mode with my files, though it was not fully satisfactory.
</p>
<h3>
  an org-mode resume
</h3>
      <p>
	Fast-forward to last May.  I'd been wanting to get on with Canonical for a long time, but hadn't found the right position, one that really matched my skills.  Then one Saturday, while I was waiting for my wife to meet me for some community event we were hosting, I saw a position that virtually described me.  I started to write a resume, but then decided that I would just take the job description elements, one-by-one, put them in an org file, and send them to the hiring manager.
      </p>
<p>
  Long-story short, almost everyone on this team used emacs, and org-mode, and lots of other .el packages that I also used every day.  I got the job, and so far, I'm very happy and feel like I fit in very well.
      </p>
      <h3>
	org-mode and my principles
      </h3>
      <p>
	Here's how I feel about using org-mode for everything: email, git, irc, web-browsing, organization, time-keeping, and so on.  And yes, I do use org-mode to connect with my email and the web, even though I use other packages (rmail, eww, magit, erc) to do the heavy lifing.  Let me walk it down, principle by principle:
	</p><ul>
	  <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Granted, emacs isn't the simplest user interface, that is, until it becomes second nature.  After that, you'll find yourself accidentally erasing cells in your Google spreadsheet when you hit "C-x C-s" to try to save (good thing there's an undo). But the fact that you can use the same text for multiple functions: appointments, task states, task notes, clocking time, building an agenda, sending email, project planning, percentage completion, ....  The list is too long to quote, but just a simple statement, like "Get the discourse publishing tool working," can become the nucleus for a whole cycle's work and all the actions that go with it.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Do one thing at a time:</strong> The window-driven nature of emacs makes it easy to switch tasks when you have to (just open another buffer) and then switch back later, and more quickly link back to where you were; not to mention that, if you become adept at using the agenda, you can keep yourself on track and move other things around with ease, and without any fear that they'll get lost.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Network:</strong> Since I'm set up to send email, IRC, Mattermost, etc., directly from my org-mode tasks, it's easy to track where I am.  But even if I used another app, it's still really easy to just cut and paste a note next to a task and then set a follow-up time to prod, all without breaking your train of thought.  You're literally still looking at the work you're doing while you're messaging about it, so there's that.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Say what you mean:</strong> You have the entire outline in front of you for whatever you're working on, so presentations, show-and-tell sessions, and status reports are really simple to give, whether verbally or in writing.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Hack...:</strong> If it doesn't do what you want, you've got customizable variables, a huge library of packages, strong macro capability, and push-come-to-shove, emacs lisp, though I rarely have to go there, TBH.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Be who you are:</strong> Org-mode matches my thinking style. Not true for everyone, but I tend to outline or mindmap (which you can do with org-mode, with the right .el package).</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Use leverage:</strong> Org-mode seriously leverages the power of plain text, in that you can either use the shortcuts to add an appointment, add tags, search tags -- or you can just do it by hand, because all of the special notation is plain text.  Leveraging human language in this way is helpful to me.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Use what you have:</strong> Org-mode and emacs give me a stable platform that works everywhere, even on a printout.  I don't need license fees, special extensions, subscriptions, add-on tools, or constant updates to keep my life humming.</li><br>

Lots of tools I've used break, crash, or get killed by absorption (I once liked Astrid, e.g., but it suddenly got sold and went away).

Growth startups require both personal and business scaling.</p>

<p>The hardest part of working at a growth startup is having to re-interview for your job every year.</p>

<h3 id="the-challenge-of-scaling">The challenge of scaling</h3>

<p>You’re heading a key function at your 25-person startup. Maybe you’re head of engineering; maybe you run marketing. Hell, maybe you’re the CEO. You kick ass and your startup grows fast – and with that growth, the needs of the company evolve. Things in the new world are now going okay, but perhaps not optimally. Eventually, the CEO and board of directors get in a room to discuss what to do.</p>

<p>I can tell you what will happen in this room. The board will discuss your performance, and compare it to the performance of other, hypothetical executives – just as if you were interviewing for your own job. In your favor: you are a known quantity, presumably viewed as talented, and perhaps even a close friend. Against you: you haven’t done this before, and we need results now.</p>

<p>In many cases this conversation will lead to you being demoted or asked to leave. In extra cruel circumstances, you can literally get fired for having done a great job. This is normal, semi-expected, and sucks. And this happens to everyone – even founding CEOs are not immune.</p>

<p>The hardest part of this situation? These hard truths often go unspoken. Sometimes it’s just too awkward to tell someone who’s been there through thick and thin that they’re expected to be a stand-in for a future big league exec. And if you have a first-time management team, they might not even realize what’s going on – they may also be in the process of not scaling fast enough, either. At least when you’re interviewing, you’re explicitly given the chance to shine; such opportunities may not be spoon-fed to you during hectic growth.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-scale-yourself">How to scale yourself</h3>

<p>To avoid this situation you need to become a self-scaling machine. Read voraciously, and find opportunities to put new skills into practice – during growth mode there’s always too much to do, so take advantage and gain actual battlefield experience. You should constantly have an image in your mind of where you expect your team to be in 6 months and steer towards that future world. Learning to see around corners allows you to scale independently, and independence is a key leadership trait since <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/05/07/startup-is-this-normal.html">startups are constantly on fire</a>. Finding mentors who are at least 2-3 years ahead of you in terms of their own careers is another great way to build these instincts.</p>

<p>And most importantly, <em>ask questions</em>. Ask your manager how they expect your job will be different in 6 months (if you’re the CEO, this advice will be slightly different –&nbsp;a trusted advisor and/or executive coach can help). Ask them what they see as your current trajectory in the role. In my experience people are way too shy about asking direct questions in general, especially to their managers – it is literally your manager’s job to provide high-quality answers to your career questions. If you nail this, it’s a fast track towards increasing responsibility and growth.</p>

<h3 id="this-isnt-a-bad-thing">This isn’t a bad thing!</h3>

<p>From the other perspective, well-run growth startups give you the regular opportunity to interview for roles that are a level higher (or two!). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissamayer/">This</a> is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcbenioff/">proven way</a> to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericsyuan/">accelerate</a> your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai#Career">career</a>. If you scale with a growing organization, you can pack decades of experience into years.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>I explore several sophisticated approximation techniques for implementing the exponential function, $f(x) = e^x$, including Taylor series approximation, Lagrange interpolation, Chebyshev interpolation, Carathéodory-Fejer approximation and MiniMax approximation.

The code for each technique is included under the corresponding Implementation heading.</em></p>

<h2 id="section-0"><a href="#section-0">Background</a></h2>

<h3 id="section-1"><a href="#section-1">Taylor series</a></h3>

<p>To motivate the definition of $e$, we will recall some calculus. Let $f$ be a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmoothFunction.html">smooth</a> function at $a$. This is to say that $f$ is infinitely <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Differentiable.html">differentiable</a> at some real value $a$: for every $k^{\text{th}}$ derivative $f^{(k)}$, we can differentiate $f^{(k)}$ again to obtain the $(k + 1)^{\text{th}}$ derivative $f^{(k + 1)}$. By definition, any function with this property which can also be uniquely represented as a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TaylorSeries.html">Taylor series</a> expansion “centered” at $a$ is called <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RealAnalyticFunction.html">analytic</a>. The Taylor series of $f$ centered at $a$ and evaluated at $x$ is defined to be</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{f(a)}{0!}(x - a)^0 + \frac{f’(a)}{1!}(x - a)^1 + \ldots + \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerSeries.html">power series</a>, or infinite polynomial with one variable. The center of expansion determines a neighborhood of values returned by the Taylor series, and the coefficient of each <em>Taylor term</em> is determined by repeatedly differentiating the function $f$ and evaluating it at $a$. A common center of expansion is $a$ = 0, in which case the Taylor series is also called a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaclaurinSeries.html">Maclaurin series</a> and the series is centered around the origin. This can be considered the “default” setting. If you cut off all terms of the Taylor expansion after some term $k$, you obtain a polynomial with degree $k$. The coefficient of the $k^{\text{th}}$ term of the series (or polynomial, if truncated) is given by</p>

<p>$$
a_{k} = \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}
$$</p>

<p>where 0! = 1.</p>

<p>For a concrete example, consider the Taylor series expansion of the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sine.html">sine</a> function. The sine function is not only infinitely differentiable, but cyclic.</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin^{(1)}(x) &amp;= \cos(x), \\
\sin^{(2)}(x) &amp;= \cos^{(1)}(x) = -\sin(x), \\
\sin^{(3)}(x) &amp;= -\sin^{(1)}(x) = -\cos(x), \\
\sin^{(4)}(x) &amp;= -\cos^{(1)}(x) = \sin(x)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>We determine each $k^{\text{th}}$ coefficient of the Taylor series by evaluating $f^{(k)}$ at $a$ and dividing it by the factorial of $k$. If we want to expand the sine function around the origin ($a$ = 0), we obtain the cyclic coefficients</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin(0) &amp;= 0, \\
\sin^{(1)}(0) &amp;= \cos(0) = 1, \\
\sin^{(2)}(0) &amp;= \cos^{(1)}(0) = -\sin(0) = 0, \\
\sin^{(3)}(0) &amp;= -\sin^{(1)}(0) = -\cos(0) = -1, \\
\sin^{(4)}(0) &amp;= -\cos^{(1)}(0) = \sin(0) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>Since $(x - 0)^{k} = x^{k}$, we have the Taylor series expansion</p>

<p>$$
\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^9}{9!} - \ldots
$$</p>

<p>Truncating the Taylor expansion of a function $f$ at any term $k$ gives a finite approximation of $f$ using the $k$ degree <em>Taylor polynomial</em>. A Taylor polynomial of $f$ centered at $a$ produces very accurate approximations of $f(x)$ when $x$ is relatively close to $a$. As the absolute value of $x$ increases away from $a$, the accuracy of the Taylor polynomial rapidly decreases, which means it requires more terms of the Taylor series (i.e. a higher degree polynomial) for accurate approximation. Consider the following plot, which shows the values of $\sin(x)$ over the interval $[-20, 20]$ compared to its Taylor polynomials of degree 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 centered at $a$ = 0.</p>

<figure>
  <p><a href="https://www.pseudorandom.com/assets/images/articles/implementing-exp/sin_taylor_series.svg"><img src="https://www.pseudorandom.com/assets/images/articles/implementing-exp/sin_taylor_series.svg"></a></p>
  <figcaption>$T_{n}$ denotes the degree $n$ Taylor polynomial of $\sin$</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Observe that the Taylor approximation of $\sin(x)$ is more accurate when $x$ is near $a$ = 0, but quickly flies away from the true value of $\sin(x)$ further away from 0. The degree 1 Taylor polynomial is only an accurate approximation for $\sin(x)$ for a very small interval near the origin, whereas the degree 9 Taylor polynomial is very accurate within $[-5, 5]$. How long the approximation holds until it becomes extremely inaccurate depends on the number of terms of the Taylor polynomial. A higher degree polynomial will maintain a better approximation of $\sin(x)$ for longer, but any finite polynomial will eventually become extremely inaccurate.</p>

<h3 id="section-2"><a href="#section-2">Defining $e$</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html">mathematical constant</a> $e$ is (almost) entirely motivated by the very nice properties it exhibits under exponentiation. In particular, the definition of $e$ was born out of the desire to find a continuous function which is its own derivative and which maps the additive identity 0 to the multiplicative identity 1. This is because solving difficult integration and differentiation problems is vastly more expedient with such a function. By extension a significant fraction of problems in applied mathematics and physics reduce to solving differential equations, for which such a function is fundamental.</p>

<p>As it happens, $f(x) = e^x$ uniquely satisfies this property. We can show this, and define $e$ directly in the process, by starting from the Taylor series representation of an arbitrary function $f$ infinitely differentiable at $a$ = 0. Suppose $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ are the coefficients of the Taylor series of $f$ centered at $a$. Then we have the Taylor series</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>It follows from the linearity of differentiation that the Taylor series expansion of the first derivative $f’$ is</p>

<p>$$
f’(x) = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>To determine a function which is its own derivative, we solve for the coefficients $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ which satisfy $f = f’$:</p>

<p>$$
a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>From here we can see the pattern</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_0 &amp;= a_1, \\
a_1 &amp;= 2a_2, \\
a_2 &amp;= 3a_3
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>and so on, which is equivalent to</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_1 &amp;= a_0, \\
a_2 &amp;= \frac{a_1}{2}, \\
a_3 &amp;= \frac{a_2}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>By induction we have a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RecurrenceEquation.html">recurrence relation</a> which defines the $k^{\text{th}}$ coefficient $a_k$</p>

<p>$$
a_k = \frac{a_{k - 1}}{k}
$$</p>

<p>Given $a_0$ = 1, we find that the Taylor series of a function which is its own derivative is</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots.
$$</p>

<p>We denote this function with $e^x$, where $e$ is defined to be the value of this function at $x$ = 1.</p>

<p>$$
e = f(1) = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k!} = 2.7183\ldots
$$</p>

<p>A more intuitive illustration of why $e^x$ is special is given by the following graph, in which exponential functions with various bases are plotted alongside their derivatives. An exponential function with a base less than $e$, like $b$ = 2, grows more quickly than its derivative. But when the base is greater than $e$, like $b$ = 4, it grows less quickly than its derivative.</p>

  <figcaption>When $b &lt; e$, we have $f'(x) &lt; f(x)$. When $b &gt; e$, we have $f'(x) &gt; f(x)$. But $b = e$ is the "goldilocks" base at which $f'(x) = f(x)$.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="section-3"><a href="#section-3">Floating point</a></h3>

<p>There is an intrinsic tension in that we want to determine accurate values of $e^x$ without doing too much work. Before we can consider the efficiency of an algorithm, we need to consider its accuracy. This leads us to define a variety of types of error, the most important of which comes from the way we approximate real numbers. It’s often impossible to calculate the exact value of $f(x)$ for an arbitrary function $f$, because computers can’t work with arbitrary real numbers.<label for="cb-3"><sup id="footnote-3"><span>3</span></sup></label><span><p>3:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all">Almost all</a> real numbers are not <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComputableNumber.html">computable</a>. The reals which are computable are frequently not exactly representable to a desirable level of accuracy because they’re either irrational (and therefore have infinite decimal expansions) or rational with very long decimal expansions.</p></span> The best we can do is approximate the value to some acceptable accuracy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> <em>floating point</em> standard discretizes real intervals into a computable form by mapping all nearby real values in given neighborhoods to a single rounded value. Internally, an IEEE 754 binary floating point number $N$ is represented using the normalized form</p>

<p>$$
N = \pm b_1.b_2b_3 \ldots b_p \times 2^{E_{k}}
$$</p>

<p>where the first bit is allocated for the sign (the <em>sign bit</em>), the $p$ bits $b_1.b_2b_3 \ldots b_p$ comprise the <em>mantissa</em>, or <em>significand</em>, and $E_{k}$ is an integer exponent consisting of $k$ bits. Note that since this form is normalized, $b_1 = 1$, while each of $b_2, \ldots b_p$ may equal 0 or 1. IEEE 754 single precision binary floating point numbers have a total size of $32$ bits: $8$ are allocated for the exponent $E \in [-126, 127]$ and $23$ are allocated for the mantissa (with $p$ = 24 accounting for the normalized bit). Thus you can represent $2^{32}$ different values in single precision floating point, with underflow and overflow limits of $2^{127} \approx 3.4 \times 10^{38}$ and $2^{-126} …</p></article></div>

<h3 id="how-i-spent-my-summer">how I spent my summer</h3>

<p>A few months ago, I decided to implement set operations on curved regions.  I had the <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540779735">the canonical textbook on computational geometry</a>, which described approaches for polygons comprised of straight lines, and it seemed like <a href="http://paperjs.org/">other projects</a> had extended these techniques to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">parametric curves</a>.  I figured it would take a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the field of computational geometry embodies a fundamental contradiction.  In geometry, the angles of a triangle add up to exactly π radians, and if <em>u</em> is clockwise from <em>v</em> then <em>v</em> must be counter-clockwise from <em>u</em>.  Computers, on the other hand, use floating point representations which make a mockery of these simple Euclidean truths.</p>

<p>The academic literature largely ignores this.  Algorithms are proven to be geometrically sound, and robust implementations are left as an exercise for the reader.  This is akin to a world in which hash collisions caused unavoidable data loss, and the academic response was to implicitly assume the existence of a perfect hash function.  If a paper is predicated on unrealistic assumptions, we cannot evaluate it on its own terms; we must understand, empirically, how well it functions when these assumptions are broken.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we can now look at the existing algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(computer_graphics)">polygon clipping</a>, which is the term of art for polygon set operations.  Every technique is a variation on a common theme:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-clipping.png" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>Given two or more rings, find every point of intersection</li>
  <li>Segment the rings at the points of intersection</li>
  <li>Decide whether each segment should be included, based on the operation being performed</li>
</ul>

<p>The dozen or so papers on this subject differ only in the third step.  Since our decision to include a segment typically inverts at an intersection point, they describe a variety of approaches for using our decision to about one segment to inform our decision about adjacent segments.</p>

<p>My textbook described a method using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list">doubly-connected edge lists</a>, which is a generic geometric data structure.  I assumed that meant it could be reused for other problems, so I started my implementation.</p>

<p>A month went by.</p>

<p>I had finished the implementation my first week, but it wasn’t reliable.  A DCEL is a collection of linked loops, which can be incrementally updated.  When performing a set operation, we incrementally bisect the original set of loops, and then determine which should and shouldn’t be included.  Despite my best efforts, I kept finding new shapes that caused adjacent faces to get tangled together, creating a Möbius strip that is simultaneously inside and outside the expected result.</p>

<p>Slowly, I realized the problem wasn’t the data structure, it was the first step that every paper glossed over: finding all the intersections.  The DCEL assumes the edges at a vertex have a total ordering: the previous edge is directly clockwise, and the next one is directly counter-clockwise.  If we miss an intersection, we might conclude two curves are both clockwise relative to the other, causing everything to fall apart.</p>

<p>I began to look for better ways to find intersections, hoping that if I found an approach that was sufficiently accurate, my work on the DCEL could be salvaged.  Unfortunately, the approaches I found in the literature and implemented in the wild were no better than what I had been using.  My data structure demanded precise inputs, without internal contradictions, and I couldn’t deliver.</p>

<p>At that point, I began to wonder if I had missed something fundamental.  I thought maybe if I dissected how other, more mature, libraries handled my pathological shapes, I could work backwards to see where I had gone wrong.  But when I began to feed these shapes into well-established projects like paper.js, I found they failed just as badly.</p>

<p>To find my pathological inputs, I had been using property-based testing.  Given a random combination of shapes, I would perform a point-in-region test and compare it to a reference result, generated by querying each shape individually and combining the results according to the operation.  Most inputs worked fine, but after a few hundred thousand inputs it would inevitably find some failure.</p>

<p>Other projects, it turned out, had been a little less eager to find their own failure modes.  Some only had a handful of example-based tests, others had a static suite of a few thousand inputs they used to validate their changes.  If I had missed something, it appeared to be that no one else expected these operations to be particularly robust.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="why-is-this-so-hard">why is this so hard?</h3>

<p>Floating point arithmetic is best understood through a simple, maddening fact: <code>a + (b - a)</code> does not necessarily equal <code>b</code>.  It might be equal, or it might be off by just a little, where “little” is relative to the larger of the two numbers.  This means that when we compare two floating point numbers, we cannot do a precise comparison, we have to ask whether they differ by less than some <em>epsilon</em> value.</p>

<p>This epsilon represents the level of numerical uncertainty to which we’ve resigned ourselves.  There is vast folk wisdom around how to minimize this uncertainty, but the fact remains that every arithmetic operation injects a bit of uncertainty, and it grows cumulatively with each successive operation.  When dealing with small numbers, this uncertainty may dwarf the values themselves.</p>

<p>An intersection, in a precise mathematical sense, occurs wherever the distance between the curves is exactly zero:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-precise-intersection.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But in a practical sense, it is wherever the distance between the curves is close enough to zero:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-fuzzy-intersection.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This has at least one intersection, but we could just as easily return three or ten within that overlapping range.  This uncertainty is anathema to the published techniques, which rely on counting these intersections to determine whether we’re inside or outside the other shape.  A single spurious intersection may cause the entire result to vanish.  If two objects with similar curvature move across each other, the result will tend to flicker in and out of existence.</p>

<p>These techniques may suffice for straight lines, which require smaller epsilons, but they are wholly unsuited to the relative imprecision of parametric curves.</p>

<h3 id="embracing-the-uncertainty">embracing the uncertainty</h3>

<p>As the weeks passed, the errors uncovered by my tests went from feeling random to feeling malicious.  Floating point arithmetic may be deterministic, but as I watched my screen, waiting for the tests to fail, I imagined a demon in the FPU nudging the values as they flowed past, trying to move them beyond the threshold of self-consistency.</p>

<p>One day, I realized this was exactly the narrative behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">error-correcting codes</a>; we assume our data has been randomly altered en route, and we want to return it to a consistent state.  It didn’t seem like I could get it right the first time, so why not just fix it afterwards?</p>

<p>Consider the union of two ellipses:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-two-ellipses.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Ostensibly, there should only be three points of intersection, one on the left and two on the right.  But for the reasons described above, any intersection routine will likely find multiple points of intersection on the left as the curves converge on each other:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-intersections.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The segments on the left are small enough, and thus imprecise enough, that our spatial intuition for the problem will just mislead us.  For this reason, it’s better to think of it as a graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-graph.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now we have to decide which edges to include, and which to exclude.  Since we’re trying to find the union, we want to keep any segments that are outside the other shape:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-valid-result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is a well-formed result; there is a single cycle, and once we remove that cycle there are no leftover edges.  But we can’t rely on getting this lucky; the edges on the left might have succumbed to floating point error and believed they were both inside the other:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-incomplete.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is not a well-formed result; there are no cycles, and a bunch of leftover edges.  To make this consistent, we need to either close the loop, or remove the leftovers.  The cost of these changes is measured by the aggregate length of the edges we are adding or removing.</p>

<p>The minimal set of changes is equivalent to the shortest path between the dangling vertices.  Having found the path, we then invert the inclusion of every edge it passes through.  In this case, it passes through one of the edges we originally excluded, so we add that edge back in, and return the cycle we just created.</p>

<p>Alternately, both edges might think they are outside the other:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-redundant.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this case, we have a complete cycle, but once we’ve extracted it there’s a single leftover edge:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-leftover.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here again, we search through all the remaining edges for the shortest path between the two dangling vertices.  Since it passes through our leftover edge, we remove it.</p>

<p>Every floating point inconsistency will surface as one of these two cases, or some combination thereof.  By searching for the shortest path between the dangling edges, we find the smallest possible edit that will yield a consistent result.  Of course, a consistent result is not necessarily the <em>correct</em> one, but the fact that floating point errors tend to cluster around the smallest edges makes this a reasonable heuristic.  More importantly, it has weathered tens of millions of generative test cases without any issues.</p>

<p>A complete implementation of this algorithm can be found <a href="https://github.com/lacuna/artifex/blob/master/src/io/lacuna/artifex/utils/regions/Clip.java">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’m not sure if this is a novel approach, but at the very least it represents a meaningful improvement on the state of the art in open source.  Intuitively, it feels like this might be a means to avoid epsilon hell in a wide range of geometric and numerical algorithms.  If anyone is aware of prior art in this vein, I’d be very interested to see it.</p>

<p>My work on the <a href="https://github.com/lacuna/artifex">Artifex</a> library is ongoing, but I hope it proves useful to others, and look forward to sharing my own projects that it will enable in the near future.</p>

  <p>How can we enable more science fiction to become reality?</p>
  <p><span>If you want to do something, it usually pays to study those who have done that thing successfully in the past. Asking </span><span>‘what is this outlier’s production function?’
    </span><span>can provide a starting point. </span></p>
  <p><span>DARPA is an outlier organization in the world of turning science fiction into reality. Since 1958, it has been a driving force in the creation of weather satellites, GPS, personal computers, modern robotics, the
      Internet, autonomous cars, and voice interfaces, to name a few. However, it is primarily limited to the domain of defense technology – there are DARPA-style ideas that are out of its scope. &nbsp;Which emulatable attributes contributed to
      DARPA’s outlier results? </span><span>What does a</span>&nbsp;domain-independent&nbsp;“ARPA Model” look like? <span>Is it possible to
      build other organizations that generate equally huge results in other domains by riffing on that model?</span></p>
  <p>Gallons of ink have been spilled describing <span>how</span><span>&nbsp;DARPA works</span><a id="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a><span>,
      but </span><span>in a nutshell here is</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>how DARPA works.</span><span>&nbsp;Around 100 </span><span>program managers (PMs)</span><span>&nbsp;with ~5 year appointments create and run <span>programs</span> to pursue high-level visions like “actualize the idea of man-comp</span><span>uter symbiosis.” In these programs they fund researchers at universities and both
      big and small companies to do research </span><span>projects</span><span>&nbsp;of different sizes. Collectively, groups working on projects are called </span><span>performers</span>.&nbsp;Top-level
      authority lies with a <span>Director </span>who ultimately reports to the Secretary of Defense. </p>
  <p><span>DARPA has an incredibly powerful model for innovation in defense research, and I believe an abstract ‘<span>ARPA Model</span>’ could yield similar results in other domains. In this piece I’ll explain in detail why
      DARPA works. I’ll use that description to feel out and describe to the best of my ability a platonic ARPA Model. &nbsp;I’ll also distill some of the model’s implications for potential riffs on the model. Incidentally,
      I’m working on just such an imitator, and in future essays, I’ll explain why this model could be incredibly powerful when executed in a privately-funded context.</span></p>
  <h4>How to use this document</h4>
  
  <p>This document acts more like a collection of atomic notes than a tight essay – a DARPA-themed tapas if you will. The order of the sections is more of a guideline than a law so feel free to skip around. Throughout you will come across internal links that <a id="self-link" href="#self-link">look like this</a>.
    These links are an attempt to illustrate the interconnectedness of the ARPA Model.</p>
  <p><span>There are two stand-alone pieces to accomodate your time and interest:</span><span> a
    </span><span><a href="#distillation">distillation</a></span><span>, and the </span><span><a href="#h.nbyw8g2b67uk">full work</a></span><span>. </span><span>The
      distillation is meant to capture and compress the main points of the full work. Each section of the distillation internally links to the corresponding section one level deeper so if you want more info and nuance you can get it. </span></p>
      <p><span>I would rather this be read by a few people motivated to take action than by a broad audience who will find it merely interesting. In that vein, if you find yourself wanting to share this on Twitter or Hacker News, consider instead sharing it with one or two friends who will take action on it. Thank you for indulging me!</span></p>

  <h2 id="program_managers_mini"><span>Program Managers</span></h2><p><span><a href="#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines">At the end of the day the ARPA Model depends on badass program managers.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Why is this the case? PMs need to
      think for themselves and go up and down the ladder of abstraction in an unstructured environment. On top of that they need to be effective communicators and coordinators because so much of their jobs is building networks. There’s a
      pattern that the abstract qualities that make “great talent” in different high-variance industries boils down to the ability to successfully make things happen under a lot of uncertainty. Given that pattern, the people who would
      make good DARPA PMs would <span>also</span> make good hedge fund analysts, first employees at startups, etc. so digging into </span><span><a href="#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?">people’s motivations for becoming a PM</a></span><span>&nbsp;is important. More precise details about what makes a PM good prevent you from going after the exact same people as every other high-variance industry. When ‘talent’ isn’t code for ‘specialized
      training’ it means the role or industry has not been systematized. Therefore, despite all the talk here and elsewhere about ‘the ARPA Model’ we must keep in mind that we may be attributing more structure to the process than
      actually exists.</span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_program_managers_pull_control_and_risk_away_from_both_researchers_and_directors">DARPA program managers pull control and risk away from both researchers and directors</a></span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;PMs pull control away
      from directors by having only one official checkpoint before launching programs and pull control away from performers through their ability to move money around quickly. PMs design programs to be high-risk aggregations of lower-risk projects.
      Only 5–10 out of every 100 programs successfully produce transformative research, while only 10% of projects are terminated early. Shifting the risk from the performers to the program managers enables DARPA to tackle </span><span>systemic </span><span>problems where other models cannot.</span></p><p><span><a href="#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_systemic_biases">The best program managers notice systemic biases and attack them. </a></span><span>For example, noticing that all of the finite element modeling literature
      assumes a locally static situation and asking ‘what if it was dynamic?’ </span><span>“The best program managers can get into the trees and still see the forest.”</span><span> Obviously, this
      quality is rather fuzzy but leads to two precise questions:</span></p>
  <ol ="1"="">
    <li><span>How do you find people who can uncover systemic biases in a discipline? </span></li>
    <li><span>How could you systematize finding systemic biases in a discipline?</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p><span>The first question suggests that you should seek out heretics and people with expertise who are not experts. The second question suggests building structured frameworks for mapping a discipline and its assumptions.
    </span></p><p><span><a href="#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building">A large part of a DARPA program manager’s job is focused network building</a></span><span>. </span><span>DARPA PMs network in the literal
      sense of creating networks, not just plugging into them. PMs meet disparate people working on ideas adjacent to the area in which they want to have an impact and bring them together in small workshops to dig into which possibilities are not
      impossible and what it would take to make them possible. The PMs host </span><span>performer days</span><span>&nbsp;— small private conferences for all the people working on different pieces of the program where
      performers can exchange ideas on what is working, what isn’t working, and build connections that don’t depend on the PM. </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a></span><a id="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a><span>&nbsp;is a
      paragon here. He brought together all the crazy people interested in human-focused computing. On top of that, &nbsp;he also helped create the first computer science lab groups. PMs also build networks of people in different classes of organizations –
      government, academia, startups, and large companies. These connections smooth the path for technologies to go from the lab to the shelf. </span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_pms_need_to_think_for_themselves,_be_curious,_and_have_low_ego">DARPA PMs need to think for themselves, be curious, and have low ego.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Why does this matter? When you are
      surrounded by smart, opinionated people the easy option is to either 100% accept what they’re saying because it’s eloquent and well-thought through or reject it outright because it sounds crazy or goes against your priors. Thinking
      for yourself allows you to avoid these traps. PMs need to be curious because building a complete picture of a discipline requires genuine curiosity to ask questions nobody else is asking. A large ego would lead to a program manager imposing
      their will on every piece of the program, killing curiosity and the benefits of top down problems and bottom up solutions.</span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers">DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>There are legal provisions in place that
      let DARPA bypass normal government hiring rules and procedures. Hiring flexibility is important because PMs are the sort of people who are in high demand, so they may be unwilling to jump through hoops. Bureaucracies ensure consistency through
      rules – minimal bureaucracy means there are no safeguards against hiring a terrible program manager so the principle that ‘A players hire A players and B players hire C players’ is incredibly important. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years">DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This transience is important for many reasons.
      Transience can inculcate PMs against the temptation to play it safe or play power games because there’s only one clear objective – make the program work. You’re out regardless of success or failure. Explicitly temporary roles can
      incentivize people with many options to join because they can have a huge impact, and then do something else. There’s no implicit tension between the knowledge that most people will leave eventually and the uncertainty about when that
      will be. Regular program manager turnover means that there is also turnover in ideas.</span></p><p><span><a href="#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?">Why do people become DARPA Program managers? </a></span>From a career and money standpoint, being a program manager seems pretty rough.<span>&nbsp;There are unique benefits though. It offers an outlet for people frustrated with the conservative nature of academia. The prospect of getting to control a lot of money without a ton of oversight appeals to some people.
      Patriotism is definitely a factor, and hard to replicate outside of a government. Being a PM can gain you the respect of a small, elite group of peers who will know what you did. Finally, there may be a particular technological vision they want
      to see out in the world and DARPA gives them the agency to make it happen in unique ways.</span></p>
  <h2 id="incentives_and_structure_mini"><span>Incentives and Structure</span></h2><p><span><a href="#opacity_is_important_to_darpa’s_outlier_success">Opacity is important to DARPA’s outlier success.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Congress and the DoD have little default oversight
      into how a PM is spending money and running a program. </span><span>Opacity removes incentives to go for easy wins or to avoid being criticized by external forces. Of course, opacity can also be abused in too many ways to list,
      so it’s important to ask: How does DARPA incentivize people not to abuse opacity? DARPA’s small size and flat structure enable peer pressure to work in …</span></p></div></div></div></div>

When I started the Redis project more than ten years ago I was in one of the most exciting moments of my career. My co-founder and I had successfully launched two of the major web 2.0 services of the Italian web. In order to make them scalable we had to invent many new concepts, that were already known in the field most of the times, but we didn’t know, nor we cared to check. Problem? Let’s figure out a solution. We wanted to solve problems but we wanted, even more, to have fun. This was the playful environment where Redis was born.

Problem is: we don’t actually want to apply this superpower and waste time nearly as often. <strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23691701">STRUCTURE</a>,&nbsp;13</strong></p></section><section><img src="https://www.notion.so/images/meta/default.png"><h2><a href="https://nova.chat/">NovaChat: Multi-Network Chat</a></h2><p><code>nova.chat</code> —  <strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23693371">NOVACHAT</a>,&nbsp;14</strong></p></section><section><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3.jpg"><h2><a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/must-ride-mule-to-from-work-location/">Must ride mule to and from work location</a></h2><p><code>deepsouthventures.com</code> — “David, this one, tell me about it …” <strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23690922">MULE</a>,&nbsp;15</strong></p></section><section><h2><a href="https://blog.c0nrad.io/hydrogen/">3D Electron Orbitals of Hydrogen</a></h2><p><code>c0nrad.io</code> —  Made with ♥ by c0nrad. code     <strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23691547">ELECTRON</a>,&nbsp;16</strong></p></section><section><img src="https://blog.google/static/blogv2/images/google-1000x1000.png"><h2><a href="https://blog.google/products/hardware/focus-helpful-devices-google-acquires-north/">Google Acquires North</a></h2><p><code>blog.google</code> — Today we're announcing that Google has acquired North, a pioneer in human computer interfaces and smart glasses.

<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>

<p>If we’re calling expensive functions in the program very frequently, It’s best to save the result of a function call and use it for future purposes rather than calling function every time. This will generally speed up the execution of the program.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The expensiveness of function can be in terms of computational (CPU usage) or latency (disk read, fetching a resource from the network).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The saving result of function calls is generally referred to as caching. The naive way to do caching is to store every function calls. But, this doesn’t scale very well with the number of parameters of function and range of each parameter.</p>

<p>So, we need a smart way to do caching with a fixed amount of memory. And, there are plenty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies">caching strategies available</a> depending upon what type of information is available to us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caching is heavily used in plenty of areas from low-level (hardware/CPU) to high level (network/CDNs).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most of the languages, We will choose caching strategies of our choice and implement them using a few data structures (hashmap, priority queue). Depending upon the language, It might take as little as few minutes to few hours to implement the generic solution of our need.</p>

<p>But, Python’s standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html">functools</a> already comes with one strategy of caching called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache">LRU(Least Recently Used)</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators">decorators</a> in python, It only takes one line to integrate into the existing codebase</p>

<p>As, <strong>we can see the optimal cache size of fib function is 5</strong>. Increasing cache size will not result in much gain in terms of speedup.</p>

<h3 id="important-note">Important Note</h3>

<p>I strictly suggest to use lru decorator in only deterministic functions.</p>

<h4 id="deterministic-functions">Deterministic Functions</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states. Deterministic algorithms are by far the most studied and familiar kind of algorithm, as well as one of the most practical, since they can be run on real machines efficiently.</p>

  <p>– Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</p>

  <p>– Phil Karlton</p>

Artificial intelligence, augmenting the brain with a math co-processor, head-up displays, neural interfaces, having perfect reaction and memory – many of you are on the same page and know the drill.

Years passed, I became a software engineer, and realized just how far we are from all these fancy technologies I wanted.
So my aspirations have become more modest, and I've chosen a more realistic and plausible target:
using my digital trace (such as browser history, webpage annotations and my <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a>) to make up for my limited memory.
</p>
<p>
I'm exploring lots of information on the Internet, and it feels wasteful to use my <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#meatsack">meat resources</a> to keep track of it.
Meanwhile, web browsers keep a record automatically, without any manual and conscious effort.
Surely we can benefit from the immense computing power and memory capabilities of computers?
</p>
<p>
So I figured that I wanted:
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what_i_want"><a href="#what_i_want">¶</a><span>2</span> Ok, maybe a web assistant at least?</h2>
<div id="text-what_i_want">
<p>
A web surfing companion. A copilot.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>.
A <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html">Remembrance Agent</a>?
</p>
<p>
Call it whatever you like, I <i>wish</i> it were a concept with a widely accepted name. Something that will sit in my browser and:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
aid me with <b>information processing</b>
</p>
<p>
Keep track of what I've read, when, on which device, and for how long.
</p></li>
<li><p>
show me my <b>annotations and highlights</b>, within the original page
</p>
<p>
I don't want to keep wondering whether I have my notes and thoughts stashed in some app, I want the computer to let me know instead.
</p></li>
<li><p>
unify my <b>scattered and siloed bookmarks</b>
</p>
<p>
Firefox bookmarks; Reddit/Hackernews saves; "Watch later" on Youtube, saved links in my instant messenger.
</p>
<p>
These are the same damn thing, yet there is no way to oversee and process them through a single interface.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://jborichevskiy.com/posts/digital-tools/#queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">"Queue management for inbound digital content"</a>:
a post expanding further on this idea.
</p></li>
<li><p>
connect with my online presence: chats and social networks
</p>
<p>
If I tweeted about a page, surely this should be somehow recorded in the browsing history?
</p>
<p>
In fact, the page that I bothered to tweet about is <b>much</b> more important than a page I merely visited in the browser.
</p></li>
<li><p>
help me explore new information and <b>prioritize</b> it
</p>
<p>
There is so much awesome stuff on the Internet! The biggest problem I have is picking the next cool link to dig into.
</p>
<p>
Imagine if in one click, I could see which of my friends, or the people I follow have read a certain link.
What did they think? Have they posted about it, annotated, or something else? Do they follow the author, perhaps I should too?
</p></li>
<li><p>
bridge the gap between the browser and my <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a>
</p>
<p>
Whatever product I choose for managing my notes: Google Keep, Evernote, Roam Research, or even org-mode files on my disk,
they always end up <b>isolated and disconnected</b> from my web browsing.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I searched for a system like this <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/767412935316611072">for</a> several <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/896313846159298560">years</a>.
</p>
<p>
After enough failed attempts at finding an <a href="#prior_art">existing solution</a>, I figured it was going to be yet another thing I'd have to implement myself.
</p>
<p>
The journey of building it took longer than I expected, led me through a rabbit hole of <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a>, lots of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a>,
and made me realize: <b>browser history is very, very broken</b>.

<h2 id="history_broken"><a href="#history_broken">¶</a><span>3</span> Browser history is broken</h2>
<div id="text-history_broken">
<p>
To a large extent, URLs express <b>relationships and hierarchy</b> between the bits of information. For example:  <code>blog &lt;-&gt; post &lt;-&gt; comment</code>, <code>person &lt;-&gt; tweet</code>, <code>playlist &lt;-&gt; video</code>.
</p>
<p>
With this information you should be easily able to find everything relevant to the current page and trace your jumps through past websites.
Merely by looking at URLs, without "AI" or some dubious machine learning algorithm!
Seems like a low hanging fruit to harvest, right?
</p>
<p>
Web browser history is a rich source of potentially useful information.
Just think about it: it's zero effort <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#lifelogging">lifelogging</a>.
It contains exact timestamps and links which <i>basically</i> address information.
</p>
<p>
Now think about the experience you actually have. What was the last time you used the browser history in any nontrivial way, for something other than reopening an accidentally closed tab?
</p>
<p>
Besides:
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="not_just_browser"><a href="#not_just_browser">¶</a>it's not just about web browsers</h3>
<div id="text-not_just_browser">
<div><p><span>
When you're using a native phone app (say, for Reddit or Twitter), your history either isn't logged anywhere or if it is, it's only stored locally on your phone.

</span></p></div>
<div><p><span>
On Android, it's likely to be in an Sqlite database in <code>/data/data/app.name</code>.
This directory is not accessible to normal users <b>unless your phone is rooted</b>.
Just think about how ridiculous this is. It's <b>your own data</b>, yet your OS babysits you, preventing access to it.

And yes, I know sandboxing and security are important, but locking my data inside the app is hardly an acceptable tradeoff.
</span></p></div>
<p>
As a specific example, the <a href="https://github.com/ccrama/Slide">Reddit Slide</a> app keeps your view history in <code>/data/data/me.ccrama.redditslide/SEEN</code>.
Okay, say you root your phone and access the database. Turns out the the app isn't persisting the data forever, it's merely keeping a few weeks' cache.
And I can hardly blame the developer for this: because of the data model, no one expects regular users to access this database.
</p>
<p>
So if you want your complete history, you have to backup this database regularly, keep the snapshots and <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/exports.html#synthetic">somehow</a>
reconstruct it.
</p>
<p>
You may dismiss this as nitpicking and obsession over every last bit of my data.
But when <b>all</b> of your phone apps are doing this you're missing out on quite a lot of useful information.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="siloed"><a href="#siloed">¶</a>it's scattered and siloed</h3>
<div id="text-siloed">
<p>
Building on the previous point:
</p>
<ul>
<li>for the most part, you can't access history in your phone apps</li>
<li>lots of data which <i>ought</i> to be counted as web history is scattered across silos

<ul>
<li><div><p><span>in the cloud: behind APIs (best case), GDPR and manual exports (worst case)

<li><p>
on the filesystem, for example in markdown/org-mode files
</p>
<p>
A slightly better scenario, but as far as the web browser is concerned, it doesn't make any difference.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Even <i>regular</i> browser history is not easy to get:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1080942">used to</a> silently 'expire' your browser history</li>
<li><p>
Chrome deletes history older than <a href="https://superuser.com/a/364475/300795">90 days</a>
</p>
<p>
The only way to access older history I'm aware of is <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/">Google Activity</a> and Takeout.
</p></li>
<li>Google Takeout <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/takeout-data-gone.html">quietly recycles your history</a></li>
<li><p>
Migration is limited to the most popular browsers
</p>
<p>
The retention limits the migration as well.
E.g. if you migrate from Chrome to Firefox, history older than 90 days is locked and siloed in your Google Account.
</p></li>
<li><p>
You're going to have a hard time if you're not using Google/Mozilla sync
</p>
<p>
Your history will be scattered across devices and lost on OS reinstalls.
</p>
<p>
There are ways of self-hosting Firefox sync, and (<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/614744/how-to-set-up-a-own-chrome-sync-server">allegedly</a>) even Chrome sync,
but as you can imagine, is quite tedious.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="significance"><a href="#significance">¶</a>it's got varying significance</h3>
<div id="text-significance">
<p>
Not all links in your history are equally important:
</p>
<ul>
<li>some are clicked on by accident</li>
<li>some you've just skimmed</li>
<li>some are on your reading list</li>
<li>some you've been reading for hours and are full of your highlights and annotations</li>
<li>some you reference in your knowledge base/personal wiki</li>
<li>some of them you've shared with others on social media</li>
</ul>
<p>
The current browser history experience makes no distinction between these scenarios.

<h2 id="urls_broken"><a href="#urls_broken">¶</a><span>4</span> URLs are broken</h2>
<div id="text-urls_broken">
<p>
This topic probably deserves a separate post, but I'll keep it section-sized for now.
</p>
<p>
URLs might seem great because they mostly address content and are semi-descriptive: people <i>try</i> to keep URLs somewhat reasonable, tidy and working.
But in the real world:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
links <b>rot</b>
</p>
<p>
Many URLs are <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Archiving-URLs#link-rot"><b>literally</b> broken</a>.
We're lucky to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/">archive.org</a>, so you can at least access dead pages.
</p>
<p>
But there is no way to migrate your browser history, e.g. point old URLs to their respective archive.org entries or a new domain.
Similarly if you had the page annotated, your annotations become orphans without an easy way to relink them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>obfuscated</b> by shortening and redirects
</p>
<div><p><span>
What happens to all the <code>t.co</code> links when Twitter as a service dies?

</span></p></div></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>obscured</b>
</p>
<p>
There is no easy way to know what's behind <code>https://www.instapaper.com/read/1265139707</code> without querying the Instapaper API.
</p>
<p>
Relations between data are often obscured as well. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22918980</code> is a submission link</li>
<li><code>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22919718</code> is a comment to that submission</li>
</ul>
<p>
These links are clearly related, but there is no way to tell it just from <samp>id</samp>.
</p>
<p>
Compare this to Reddit links:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is</code> is a post link</li>
<li><code>https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is/fo9qnen</code> is a comment to that post</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ids are obscure, but at least we can clearly see the <code>post &lt;-&gt; comment</code> relation merely by looking at the URLs.
Alas, browsers are just ignoring this useful information.
</p></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>unstandardized</b>
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">queries</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>typically don't point to anything persistent and are used for querying (duh)</li>
<li>but other times they are used to address information: <code>http://wiki.c2.com/?LispLanguage</code> or <code>https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2694</code></li>
<li>and in many cases are utter garbage used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Tracking">tracking</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The worst part is that these use cases overlap. For example, take a look at <code>youtube.com/watch?v=wHrCkyoe72U&amp;feature=share&amp;t…</code></p></li></ul></div></div></section></article></div>

<h4><em><strong>This will be a chapter in my upcoming book “Functional MRI” </strong><strong>in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series&nbsp;</strong></em></h4>
<hr>
<p>Functional MRI is unique in that, in spite of being almost 30 years old as a method, it continues to progress in terms of sophistication of acquisition, hardware, processing, in our understanding of the signal itself. There has been no plateau in any of these areas. In fact, by looking at the literature, one gets the impression that this advancement is accelerating. Every new advance opens the potential range where it might have an impact, allowing new questions about the brain to be addressed.</p>
<p>In spite of its success – perhaps as a result of its success – it has had its share of controversies coincident with methods advancements, new observations, and novel applications. Some controversies have been more contentious than others. Over the years, I’ve been following these controversies and have at times performed research to resolve them or at least better understand them. A good controversy can help to move the field forward as it can focus and motivate groups of people to work on the issue itself, shedding a broader light on the field as these are overcome.</p>
<p>While a few of the controversies or issues of contention have been fully resolved, most remain to some degree unresolved. Understanding fMRI through its controversies allows a deeper appreciation for how the field advances as a whole – and how science really works – the false starts, the corrections, and the various claims made by those with potentially useful pulse sequences, processing methods, or applications. Below is the list of twenty-six major controversies in fMRI – in approximately chronological order.</p>
<h2>#1: The Neurovascular coupling debate.</h2>
<p>Since the late 1800’s, the general consensus, hypothesized by Roy and Sherrington in 1890 (1), was that activation-induced cerebral flow changes were driven by local changes in metabolic demand. In 1986, a publication by Fox et al. (2)challenged that view, demonstrating that with activation, localized blood flow seemingly increased beyond oxidative metabolic demand, suggesting an “uncoupling” of the hemodynamic response from metabolic demand during activation. Many, including Louis Sokolof, a well-established neurophysiologist at the National Institutes of Health, strongly debated the results. Fox nicely describes this period in history from his perspective in “The coupling controversy” (3).</p>
<p>I remember well, in the early days of fMRI, Dr. Sokolof standing up from the audience to debate Fox on several circumstances, arguing that the flow response should match the metabolic need and there should be no change in oxygenation. He argued that what we are seeing in fMRI is something other than an oxygenation change.</p>
<p>In the pre-fMRI days, I recall not knowing what direction the signal should go – as when I first laid eyes on the impactful video presented by Tom Brady during his plenary lecture on the future of MRI at the Society for Magnetic Resonance (SMR) Meeting in August of 1991, it was not clear from these time series movies of subtracted images the direction he performed the subtraction operation. Was it task minus rest or rest minus task? Did the signal go up or down with activation? I also remember very well, analyzing my first fMRI experiments, expecting to see a decrease in BOLD signal – as Ogawa, in an earlier paper(4), hypothesized that metabolic rate increases would lead to a decrease blood oxygenation thus a darkening of the BOLD signal during brain activation. Instead, all I saw were signal increases. It was Fox’s work that helped me to understand why the BOLD signal should <em>increase</em>with activation. Flow goes up and oxygen delivery exceeds metabolic need, leading to an increase in blood oxygenation.</p>
<p>While models of neurovascular coupling have improved, we still do not understand the precise need for flow increases. First, we had the “watering the whole garden to feed one thirsty flower” hypothesis which suggested that flow increases matched metabolic need for one area but since vascular control was coarse, the abundant oxygenation was delivered to a wider area than was needed, causing the increase in oxygenation. We also had the “diffusion limited” model, where it was hypothesized that in order to deliver enough oxygen to the furthest neurons from the oxygen supplying vessels, an overabundance of oxygen was needed at the vessel itself since the decrease of oxygen as it diffused from the vessel to the furthest cell was described as an exponential. &nbsp;This theory has fallen a bit from favor as the increases in CMRO<sub>2</sub>or the degree to which the diffusion of oxygen to tissue from blood is limited tend to be higher than physiologic measures. The alternative to the metabolic need hypothesis involves neurogenic “feed-forward” hypotheses – which still doesn’t get at the “why” of the flow response.</p>
<p>Currently, this is where the field stands. We know that the flow response is robust and consistent. We know that in active areas, oxygenation in healthy brains always increases, however we just don’t understand specifically why it’s necessary. Is it a neurogenic, metabolic, or some other mechanism to satisfy some evolutionary critical need that extends beyond simple need for more oxygen? We are still figuring that out. Nevertheless, it can be said that whatever the reason for this increase in flow, it is fundamentally important, as the BOLD response is stunningly consistent.</p>
<h2>#2: The Draining Vein Effect</h2>
<p>The question: “what about the draining veins?” I think was first posited at an early fMRI conference by Kamil Ugurbil of the University of Minnesota. Here and for the next several years he alerted the community to the observation that, especially at low field, draining veins are a problem as they smear and distort the fMRI signal change such that it’s hard to know specifically where the underlying neuronal activation is with a high degree of certainty. In the “20 years of fMRI: the science and the stories” special issue of NeuroImage, Ravi Menon writes a thorough narrative of the “Great brain vs vein” debate (5). &nbsp;When the first fMRI papers were published, only one, by Ogawa et al. (6), was at high field – 4 Tesla – and relatively high resolution. In Ogawa’s paper, it was shown that there was a differentiation between veins (very hot spots) and capillaries (more diffuse weaker activation in grey matter). Ravi followed this up with another paper (7)using multi-echo imaging, to show that blood in veins had an intrinsically shorter T2* decay than gray matter at 4T and appeared as dark dots in T2* weighted structural images yet appeared as bright functional hot spots in the 4T functional images. Because of the low SNR and CNR at 1.5T, allowing only the strongest BOLD effects to be seen, and because models suggested that at low field strengths, large vessels contributed the most to the signal, the field worried that all fMRI was looking at was veins – at least at 1.5T.</p>
<p>The problem of large vein effects is prevalent using standard gradient-echo EPI – even at high fields. Simply put, the BOLD signal is directly proportional to the venous blood volume contribution in each voxel. If the venous blood volume is high – as with the case of a vein filling a voxel – then the potential for high BOLD changes is high if there is a blood oxygenation change in the area. At high field, indeed, there is not much intravascular signal left in T2* weighted Gradient-echo sequences, however, the extravascular effect of large vessels still exists.&nbsp; Spin-echo sequences (sensitive to small compartments) still are sensitive to the susceptibility effects around intravascular red blood cells within large vessels – even at 7T where intravascular contribution is reduced. Even with some vein sensitivity, promising high resolution orientation column results have been produced at 7T using gradient-echo and spin-echo sequences (8). The use of arterial spin labeling has potential as a method insensitive to large veins, although the temporal efficiency, intrinsic sensitivity, and brain coverage limitations blunt its utility. Vascular Space Occupancy (VASO), a method sensitive to blood volume changes, has been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to blood volume changes in small vessels and capillaries. Preliminary results have shown clear layer dependent activation using VASO where other approaches have provided less clear delineation(9).</p>
<p>Methods have arisen to identify and mask large vein effects – including thresholding based on percent signal change (large veins tend to fill voxels and thus exhibit a larger fractional signal change), as well as temporal fluctuations (large veins are pulsatile thus exhibit more magnitude and phase noise). While these seem to be workable solutions, they have not been picked up and used extensively. With regard to using the phase variations as a regressor to eliminate pulsatile blood and tissue, perhaps the primary reason for this not being adopted is because standard scanners do not produce these images readily, thus users do not have easy access to this information.</p>
<p>The draining vein issue is least problematic at voxel sizes larger than 2mm, as at these resolutions, mostly the region of activation- as defined as &gt;1 cm “blob” is used and interpreted. Other than enhancing the magnitude of activation, vein effects do not distort these “blobs” thus are typically of no …</p></div></article></div>

    <small>Published on 22. June 2020</small>
    <p>I was looking for an alternative to Google Analytics to track visitors on a website. Analytics (and most of its competitors) provide detailed information and real-time data at the cost of privacy. Google can track you across sites using a bunch of different techniques and through their Chrome browser. Combined, this can be assembled to a detailed profile that can not only be used for tracking, but for marketing too.</p><p>I found some (open source) alternatives like <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GoatCounter</a>, which anonymously collect data without invading the user's privacy. But all of the tools I found either rely on cookies, which the visitor needs to opt-in for or cost money for the server-side only tracking solution. While I'm willing to pay for good software, especially when it comes from a small team or just one developer, I was wondering if I could build something that I can integrate into my Go applications.</p><p>This post is about my solution called <em>Pirsch</em>, an open-source Go library that can be integrated into your applications to tracks visitors on the server-side, without setting cookies. I will write about the technique used and what the advantages and disadvantages are.</p><blockquote><h2>TL;DR</h2><p>Invading the privacy of your website visitors is evil. Pirsch is a privacy-focused tracking library for Go that can be integrated into your applications. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/emvi/pirsch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>!</p><p>You can find a live demo <a href="https://marvinblum.de/tracking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> on my website and the whole thing on GitHub as a <a href="https://github.com/Kugelschieber/marvinblum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sample application</a>.</p></blockquote><h2>What's With the Name?</h2><p>Pirsch is German and refers to a special kind of hunt:&nbsp;<em>the hunter carefully and quietly enters the area to be hunted, he stalks against the wind in order to get as close as possible to the prey without being noticed.</em></p><p>I found this quite fitting for a tracking library that cannot be blocked by the visitor. Even though it sounds a little sneaky. Here is the Gopher for it create by <a href="https://github.com/Motorschpocht" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Daniel</a>.</p><img src="https://marvinblum.de/static/blog/OxdzmGZ1Bl/0wV4YBIYaCm9JiteSaa3.svg" alt="https://api.emvi.com/api/v1/content/0wV4YBIYaCm9JiteSaa3.svg"><h2>How Does It Work?</h2><p>I will go over each step in more detail later, but here is a high-level overview of how Pirsch tracks visitors.</p><img src="https://marvinblum.de/static/blog/OxdzmGZ1Bl/vuvopEa9M7yGpKWgwXht.svg" alt="https://api.emvi.com/api/v1/content/vuvopEa9M7yGpKWgwXht.svg"><p>Once someone visits your website, the HTTP handler calls Pirsch to store a new hit and goes on with whatever it intends to do. Pirsch will do its best to filter out bots, calculate a fingerprint, and stores the page hit. You can analyze the data and generate statistics from it later.</p><p>The process must be triggered manually by calling the <code>Hit</code> method and passing the <code>http.Request</code>. This enables you to decide which traffic is tracked and which is not. I'm usually just interested in page visits, so I'll add a call to Pirsch inside my page handlers. Resources are served on a different endpoint and won't be tracked that way.</p><h3>Fingerprinting</h3><p>Fingerprinting is a technique to identify individual devices by combing some parameters. The parameters are typically things like the graphics card ID and other variables that are unique to a device. As we are interested in tracking website traffic, we won't have access to this kind of information. Instead, we can make use of the IP and HTTP protocol. Here are the parameters used by Pirsch to generate a fingerprint:</p><ul><li><p>the IP is the most obvious choice. It might change, as ISPs only have a limited pool of IPs available to them, but that shouldn't happen too frequently</p></li><li><p>the User-Agent HTTP header contains information about the browser and device used by the visitor. It might not be filled though, but it usually is</p></li></ul><p>To generate a unique fingerprint from this information, we can calculate a hash. Pirsch will add the current day to prevent tracking users across days and calculate an MD5 hash. I found this to be the fastest algorithm available in the Go standard library. This will also make the visitor anonymous at the same time as we do not store IPs or other identifiable information.</p><p>This method is called <em>passive</em> fingerprinting, as we're only using data that we have access to anyways. The alternative is called <em>active</em> fingerprinting, which makes use of JavaScript to collect additional information on the client-side and sends it to the backend. But as we're trying to build a privacy-focus tracking solution, passive fingerprinting is the way to go.</p><p>We will use the fingerprint later to count unique visitors.</p><h3>Filtering Bots</h3><p>Filtering out bot traffic is hard, as there is no complete list of all bots and they won't send any special kind of information, like an <em>I'm a bot</em> header. All we can do is to process the IP and the User-Agent header send and make some assumptions. Pirsch will look for terms often used by bots within the User-Agent header. Should it contain words like <em>bot</em> or <em>crawler</em> or an URL, the hit will be dropped. Filtering for IP ranges is not implemented (yet), but you can filter hits that are coming from popular IP ranges, like AWS.</p><h3>Hits</h3><p>Each page request is stored as a <em>Hit</em>. A hit is a data point that can later be analyzed. Here is the definition of a hit:</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">// I removed some details to make it more readable for this blog post
type Hit struct {
	Fingerprint string
	Path        string
	URL         string
	Language    string
	UserAgent   string
	Ref         string
	Time        time.Time
}</code></pre><p>A hit contains the full request URL, the path extracted from the URL, the language, user-agent and reference passed by the client in their corresponding headers and the time the request was made.</p><h3>Analyze</h3><p>Pirsch provides an <em>Analyzer</em> that can be used to extract some basic statistics:</p><ul><li><p>total visitor count</p></li><li><p>visitors by page on each day</p></li><li><p>visitors by hour on each day</p></li><li><p>languages used by visitors</p></li><li><p>active visitors within a time frame</p></li></ul><p>Most of these functions accept a filter to specify a time frame. The data can then be plotted like on my <a href="https://marvinblum.de/tracking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tracking page</a>.</p><img src="https://marvinblum.de/static/blog/OxdzmGZ1Bl/QOeMcMKi8yS2p4WB2Xlu.png" alt="https://api.emvi.com/api/v1/content/QOeMcMKi8yS2p4WB2Xlu.png"><p>To reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed the hits get aggregated each night and hits are cleaned up afterward.</p><p>Postgres is used as the storage backend at the moment as it is a fantastic open-source database and provides all features needed to read these statistics easily. You can extract more statistics, like the visitor page flow, from the database if you care.</p><h3>Tracking From JavaScript</h3><p>While it is simple to integrate tracking into your backend, you might also want to have some way to track from your frontend as well, in case you're running a single page application for example. In that case, you can add an endpoint to your router and call it using Ajax. The path can manually be overwritten in Pirsch by calling <em>HitPage</em> instead of <em>Hit</em>.</p><h2>How Well Does It Work?</h2><p>As far as I can tell right now, it works pretty well. I still need to collect more sample data and a way to compare it to something like Google Analytics in order to make a more precise statement. Keep in mind that while Analytics and other tools provide more detailed statistics, like the location, age, gender, and so on, they can be blocked by tools like uBlock. Pirsch cannot be blocked by the client and therefore it can track visitors you won't even notice with a client-side solution.</p><p>Bots are probably the weak spot of Pirsch right now, as filtering for them requires adding a whole bunch of keywords to the filter list.</p><p>Another disadvantage of server-side tracking depending on your use-case  might be that you cannot track your marketing campaigns. In case you're using Adsense for marketing, you can track how well your campaigns perform through Analytics. This won't work with Pirsch.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Tracking on the server-side isn't too hard to archive and all in all, I think it's worth the effort. I hope you gained some insight into how you can use fingerprinting and Pirsch to your advantage. I will continue improving Pirsch and implement it into <a href="https://emvi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emvi</a> and compare the output to Analytics. I might also add a user interface for Pirsch so that you can host it without integrating it into your application and without the need to generate the charts yourself. In case you would like to send me feedback, have a question, or would like to contribute you can contact me.</p>

run a program which calls <code>open</code>, <code>fork</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> (and many others) you are making a system call.</p><p>System calls are how a program enters the kernel to perform some task. Programs use system calls to perform a variety of operations such as: creating processes, doing network and file IO, and much more.</p><p>You can find a list of system calls by checking the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html">man page for syscalls(2)</a>.</p><p>There are several different ways for user programs to make system calls and the low-level instructions for making a system call vary among CPU architectures.</p><p>As an application developer, you don’t typically need to think about how exactly a system call is made. You simply include the appropriate header file and make the call as if it were a normal function.</p><p><code>glibc</code> provides wrapper code which abstracts you away from the underlying code which arranges the arguments you’ve passed and enters the kernel.</p><p>Before we can dive into the details of how system calls are made, we’ll need to define some terms and examine some core ideas that will appear later.</p><h2 id="hardware-and-software">Hardware and software</h2><p>This blog post makes the following assumptions that:</p><ul><li>You are using a 32-bit or 64-bit Intel or AMD CPU. The discussion about the methods may be useful for people using other systems, but the code samples below contain CPU-specific code.</li><li>You are interested in the Linux kernel, version 3.13.0. Other kernel versions will be similar, but the exact line numbers, organization of code, and file paths will vary. Links to the 3.13.0 kernel source tree on GitHub are provided.</li><li>You are interested in <code>glibc</code> or <code>glibc</code> derived libc implementations (e.g., <code>eglibc</code>).</li></ul><p>x86-64 in this blog post will refer to 64bit Intel and AMD CPUs that are based on the x86 architecture.</p><h2 id="user-programs-the-kernel-and-cpu-privilege-levels">User programs, the kernel, and CPU privilege levels</h2><p>User programs (like your editor, terminal, ssh daemon, etc) need to interact with the Linux kernel so that the kernel can perform a set of operations on behalf of your user programs that they can’t perform themselves.</p><p>For example, if a user program needs to do some sort of IO (<code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, etc) or modify its address space (<code>mmap</code>, <code>sbrk</code>, etc) it must trigger the kernel to run to complete those actions on its behalf.</p><p>What prevents user programs from performing these actions themselves?</p><p>It turns out that the x86-64 CPUs have a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_level">privilege levels</a>. Privilege levels are a complex topic suitable for their own blog post. For the purposes of this post, we can (greatly) simplify the concept of privilege levels by saying:</p><ol><li>Privilege levels are a means of access control. The current privilege level determines which CPU instructions and IO may be performed.</li><li>The kernel runs at the most privileged level, called “Ring 0”. User programs run at a lesser level, typically “Ring 3”.</li></ol><p>In order for a user program to perform some privileged operation, it must cause a privilege level change (from “Ring 3” to “Ring 0”) so that the kernel can execute.</p><p>There are several ways to cause a privilege level change and trigger the kernel to perform some action.</p><p>Let’s start with a common way to cause the kernel to execute: interrupts.</p><h2 id="interrupts">Interrupts</h2><p>You can think of an interrupt as an event that is generated (or “raised”) by hardware or software.</p><p>A hardware interrupt is raised by a hardware device to notify the kernel that a particular event has occurred. A common example of this type of interrupt is an interrupt generated when a NIC receives a packet.</p><p>A software interrupt is raised by executing a piece of code. On x86-64 systems, a software interrupt can be raised by executing the <code>int</code> instruction.</p><p>Interrupts usually have numbers assigned to them. Some of these interrupt numbers have a special meaning.</p><p>You can imagine an array that lives in memory on the CPU. Each entry in this array maps to an interrupt number. Each entry contains the address of a function that the CPU will begin executing when that interrupt is received along with some options, like what privilege level the interrupt handler function should be executed in.</p><p>Here’s a photo from the Intel CPU manual showing the layout of an entry in this array:</p><p><img src="https://blog.packagecloud.io/images/idt.png" alt="Screenshot of Interrupt Descriptor Table entry diagram for x86_64 CPUs"></p><p>If you look closely at the diagram, you can see a 2-bit field labeled DPL (Descriptor Privilege Level). The value in this field determines the minimum privilege level the CPU will be in when the handler function is executed.</p><p>This is how the CPU knows which address it should execute when a particular type of event is received and what privilege level the handler for that event should execute in.</p><p>In practice, there are lots of different ways to deal with interrupts on x86-64 systems. If you are interested in learning more read about the <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/8259_PIC">8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller</a>, <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/APIC">Advanced Interrupt Controllers</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/IOAPIC">IO Advanced Interrupt Controllers</a>.</p><p>There are other complexities involved with dealing with both hardware and software interrupts, such as interrupt number collisions and remapping.</p><p>We don’t need to concern ourselves with these details for this discussion about system calls.</p><h2 id="model-specific-registers-msrs">Model Specific Registers (MSRs)</h2><p>Model Specific Registers (also known as MSRs) are control registers that have a specific purpose to control certain features of the CPU. The CPU documentation lists the addresses of each of the MSRs.</p><p>You can use the CPU instructions <code>rdmsr</code> to <code>wrmsr</code> to read and write MSRs, respectively.</p><p>There are also command line tools which allow you to read and write MSRs, but doing this is <em>not recommended</em> as changing these values (especially while a system is running) is dangerous unless you are really careful.</p><p>If you don’t mind potentially destabilizing your system or irreversibly corrupting your data, you can read and write MSRs by installing <code>msr-tools</code> and loading the <code>msr</code> kernel module:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">% <span>sudo </span>apt-get install msr-tools
% <span>sudo </span>modprobe msr
% <span>sudo </span>rdmsr</code></pre></figure><p>Some of the system call methods we’ll see later make use of MSRs, as we’ll see soon.</p><h2 id="calling-system-calls-with-assembly-is-a-bad-idea">Calling system calls with assembly is a bad idea</h2><p>It’s not a great idea to call system calls by writing your own assembly code.</p><p>One big reason for this is that some system calls have additional code that runs in glibc before or after the system call runs.</p><p>In the examples below, we’ll be using the <code>exit</code> system call. It turns out that you can register functions to run when <code>exit</code> is called by a program by using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/atexit.3.html"><code>atexit</code></a>.</p><p>Those functions are called from glibc, not the kernel. So, if you write your own assembly to call <code>exit</code> as we show below, your registered handler functions won’t be executed since you are bypassing glibc.</p><p>Nevertheless, manually making system calls with assembly is a good learning experience.</p><div><p>Create a package repository in less than 10 seconds, free.</p></div><p>Using our prerequisite knowledge we know two things:</p><ol><li>We know that we can trigger the kernel to execute by generating a software interrupt.</li><li>We can generate a software interrupt with the <code>int</code> assembly instruction.</li></ol><p>Combining these two concepts leads us to the legacy system call interface on Linux.</p><p>The Linux kernel sets aside a specific software interrupt number that can be used by user space programs to enter the kernel and execute a system call.</p><p>The Linux kernel registers an interrupt handler named <code>ia32_syscall</code> for the interrupt number: 128 (0x80). Let’s take a look at the code that actually does this.</p><p>From the <code>trap_init</code> function in the kernel 3.13.0 source in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.13/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L770"><code>arch/x86/kernel/traps.c</code></a>:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>void</span> <span>__init</span> <span>trap_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>

The arguments for the syscall itself are to be placed in the remaining general purpose registers.</p><p>One place this is documented is in a comment in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.13/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L378-L397"><code>arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S</code></a>:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="c"> <span>*</span> <span>Emulated</span> <span>IA32</span> <span>system</span> <span>calls</span> <span>via</span> <span>int</span> <span>0x80</span><span>.</span>

<p>Haskell programs are constructed at the junction of two worlds: one of types, and the other of values. Values are operational run-time entities that are denoted syntactically by <em>terms</em> in the code. To this end, types classify terms. They provide a powerful abstraction to organize data, determine how it should be stored in memory, passed through various operations, and more. On a superficial level, the difference between these worlds is simple: <em>types</em> refer to datatypes, which are either built-in (such as <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code>), or user-declared, for example:</p>

<pre><code>data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
</code></pre>

<p>By comparison, <em>values</em> are denoted by <em>terms</em> those types categorize (such as <code>1</code> and <code>"abc"</code> described by the standard library’s <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code> types, or <code>Cady</code> and <code>Regina</code> in the case of our user-declared type, <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>). Thus, the term <code>1</code> denotes a value that exists in memory only when the program is run.</p>

<p>In addition to these two worlds, a third, darker, and more elusive underworld of <em>kinds</em> also lurks in the shadows of Haskell programs. Haskell kinds can be as unpredictable and insidious as the soulless alpha-female of an elite high school clique. While daunting, understanding the coaction between these three worlds lays the foundation for type-level programming, a topic worth learning as it strengthens overall Haskell intuition.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-is-a-virtue">Kindness is a virtue</h3>

<p>Much like counter-intuitive adolescent social dynamics, mastery of Haskell bears a steep learning curve because of its underlying complexity. It is difficult to wrap one’s head around the language’s typeclass hierarchies, category-theoretic roots, or the intricacies of compiler behavior. However, an intimate understanding of the type system lets programmers look beyond the chaos of code and apply a recognizable template by which to understand it.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-takes-patience">Kindness takes patience</h3>

<p>This topic is also difficult to master because it is both vast and subtle. Ideas underlying type-level programming are scattered across many disconnected resources focused on several corners of the Haskell ecosystem. Authoritative references on the topic (such as relevant library documentation) tend to assume familiarity with domain-specific terminology that may be unknown to non-experts. Due to the paucity of approachable materials on the subject, I’ve attempted to break down type-level programming into explanations of its constituent parts. While I don’t go into extensive depth on any individual section below, I hope to provide a valuable starting point with which readers can explore ideas in greater detail.</p>

<h3 id="types-vs-values">Types vs. Values</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, Haskell programs are divided into two worlds: the <em>type-level</em> and the <em>value-level</em>. The <em>type-level</em> refers to the part of a program analyzed by the static type-checking phase during compilation. Since every expression is assigned a type, code is checked against Haskell’s type system to ensure it fits <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>’s specified correctness criteria.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704534-fce9fd80-af27-11ea-9544-13961a56c444.png" alt="types classify terms, just like hostile teens with identity crises classify one another"></p>

<p>If the program is well-typed, the program will compile. However, this type-information evaporates once the compilation process terminates, leaving only <em>values</em> behind at run-time. In this way, types and values can be better distinguished by the phasing distinction, with types being compile-time entities and values being run-time entities.</p>

<p>For example, if a function takes a <code>String</code>, the type-checker doesn’t care if the <code>String</code> has a value denoted by <code>"abc"</code> or <code>"123"</code> or <code>"get in loser"</code>—so long as it’s a <code>String</code>. Type information gets discarded at run-time, leaving only the string’s value (ex.,<code>"get in loser"</code>). In some cases, however, we want the type system to care about what those values are and distinguish between them. The <code>DataKinds</code> extension, which we’ll explore below, lets us do that by allowing us to shove more information about our program into the type system. This lets us add meaning to the value of a <code>String</code> at the type-level, moving them from their usual, strictly run-time existence, into the compile-time phase. The technique allows us to use more information statically in the logical development and abstraction of the program’s behavior. We’re also able to add consequences that can halt compilation if the specific value of <code>String</code> doesn’t conform to the rules we’ve specified, or define classes over them.</p>

<h4 id="distinguishing-types-and-values-in-ghci">Distinguishing types and values in GHCi</h4>

<p>Let’s examine our aforementioned <code>SpringFlingQueen</code> datatype in GHCi. When we query the type of one of its constructors using <code>:t</code> (a handy shorthand for <code>:type</code>), we see that it is indeed of type <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
λ :t Cady
Cady :: SpringFlingQueen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider literals <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>. These are <em>values</em> of a type that parameterizes the <code>Num</code> class:</p>



<p>Typing <code>:t 1</code> into GHCi gives us <code>Num p =&gt; p</code>, indicating that a literal such as <code>1</code> can be of any polymorphic type <code>p</code> as long as the <code>Num</code> type class has instances for that type (for example, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code> both have <code>Num</code> instances and therefore are valid types that <code>p</code> could be instantiated with). This is possible due to <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_inference">type inference</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704346-ae3c6380-af27-11ea-8078-6f1ddfc7b238.png" alt="type inference can be used to deduce concrete types wherever they're obvious. If a type looks like a mouse, it's a mouse—duh!"></p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>Just like types classify terms, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1">kinds</a> classify types, and therefore are frequently described as “types of types”, or referred to be “one level up.” The “star” syntax (i.e., <code>*</code>) denotes kinds. It is defiantly used in this post despite <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0143-remove-star-kind.rst">recent syntactic changes</a>. A prerequisite for understanding the kind system necessitates comprehending the differences between three pairs of ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data constructors vs. type constructors:</strong> data constructors create values, whereas type constructors create types. Type constructors take one or more type arguments and produce a datatype when enough arguments are provided. This means that through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying">currying</a>, a type constructor can be <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially applied</a>. For example, the list type constructor <code>[]</code> may take a single type argument (ex. <code>String</code>) to denote the elements of the list (i.e., <code>[String]</code>). <code>[String]</code> is simply syntactic sugar for <code>[] String</code>, where the type <code>[]</code> is applied to <code>String</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full vs. partial application</strong> A partially-applied type, like a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially-applied function</a>, is one that is missing some of its data constructors. For instance, consider the list type <code>[]</code>. The kind of <code>[]</code> is <code>* -&gt; *</code>. A fully-applied list has data constructors, such as <code>[Int]</code>, and its kind is <code>*</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inhabited types vs. uninhabited types:</strong> An inhabitant of a type is precisely a value of that type. This means that <em>inhabited</em> types refer to the types that contain concrete values, such as the value denoted by the term <code>1 :: Int</code>. This suggests that the type <code>Int</code> is inhabited by value denoted by <code>1</code>. By contrast, <em>uninhabited</em> types refer to type constructors to which no values are abstracted. For instance, <code>Void</code> is uninhabited because it has no data constructors, and thus can not be used to construct a valid term. While <code>Void</code> may seem pointless at first, it can be a useful way to represent that a container is empty (ex., <code>[Void]</code>, which <em>is</em> inhabited by the term <code>[]</code> and the value this term denotes).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How do these ideas relate to the kind system? Well, all fully-applied runtime values are of kind <code>*</code> <em>and</em> they are inhabited. You can confirm this by typing <code>:k Int</code> and <code>:k String</code> in GHCi. However, this doesn’t work the other way around—just because a type is inhabited, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s fully-applied (ex., <code>[]</code> is not fully-applied but it <em>is</em> inhabited, and its kind signature is <code>* -&gt; *</code>). Conversely, all partially-applied types are uninhabited (since they don’t correspond to a value), but not all uninhabited types are partially applied. <code>Void</code> for instance is not partially-applied, but it is uninhabited.</p>

<p>To get the hang of this idea, consider the following examples:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Inhabited?</th>
      <th>Fully-applied?</th>
      <th>Kind</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Int</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>String</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[Int]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(,)</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Void</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either Void Void</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Kind signatures can be specified manually in GHCi using the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XKindSignatures"><code>XKindSignatures</code></a> extension. Try extending the above table by investigating the kind signatures of various types.</p>

<h3 id="higher-kinded-types">Higher-kinded types</h3>

<p>Just like there are higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), there are higher-kinded types (types constructors that take other type constructors as arguments). Type constructors such as <code>[]</code> are a first-class type, but also a higher-kinded type, given they take another type constructor to be reified:</p>



<p>Let’s consider <code>Functor</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :k Functor
Functor :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; Constraint
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> takes a type constructor <code>* -&gt; *</code> and returns a <code>Constraint</code>. Let’s use <code>:info</code> to examine <code>Functor</code> a bit more closely:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :info Functor
class Functor (f :: * -&gt; *) where
  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
  (&lt;$) :: a -&gt; f b -&gt; f a
  {-# MINIMAL fmap #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Functor ((,,,) a b c) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor ((,,) a b) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor Maybe -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> allows type constructors like <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> to have <code>Functor</code> instances, but not <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. This is because <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> are <code>* -&gt; *</code>, while <code>Int</code> has kind <code>*</code>. Similarly, <code>Either</code> has <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, which is why its instance above is parameterized with a type parameter denoting something of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>: <code>Either a</code>.</p>

    <span>uint32_t</span> chain[];
};
</pre><h2>Bloom filter</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a> is used to stop the lookup for missing symbols early. <code>bloom_size</code>, <code>bloom_shift</code>, and <code>bloom</code> are parts of the structure, as their names suggest.</p><p>Bloom filter behaves slightly differently for various <code>ELFCLASS</code> binaries (defined by <code>EI_CLASS</code> field in <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/gabi4+/ch4.eheader.html#elfid">ELF Identification</a>). Let's define <code>ELFCLASS_BITS</code> to be <code>64</code> for 64-bit binaries (<code>ELFCLASS64</code>) and <code>32</code> for 32-bit binaries (<code>ELFCLASS32</code>).</p><p>Before doing symbol lookup, take <code>bloom[(hash / ELFCLASS_BITS) % bloom_size]</code>. If bits <code>hash % ELFCLASS_BITS</code> and <code>(hash &gt;&gt; bloom_shift) % ELFCLASS_BITS</code> are set then a symbol <strong>may or may not</strong> be in the hash table, and you should proceed with a regular lookup through buckets and chains. But if at least one bit is not set then a symbol is <strong>certainly</strong> absent from the hash table.</p><h2>Buckets and chains</h2><p><code>DT_HASH</code> contains an element per symbol table's element. This leads to a waste of space because <code>STN_UNDEF</code> and some other symbols are in the hash table but are never looked up. GNU hash table allows to skip first <code>symoffset</code> symbols at the beginning of the symbol table.</p><p>Same as in <code>DT_HASH</code>, symbols are put in one of <code>nbuckets</code> buckets depending on their hashes. To be specific, each symbol should be placed into <code>hash % nbuckets</code> bucket.</p><p>Chains in the GNU hash table are nothing like strange linked lists in <code>DT_HASH</code>, they are contiguous sequences of hashes for symbols with the same index (remember that chains' indexes are shifted by <code>symoffset</code> relatively to the symbol table). The last bit in chains' element is discarded and instead used for indicating the chain's end. If it is set then the element is the last one in the chain.</p><p><code>bucket</code> array holds indexes of the first symbols in the chains. Note that those are not indexes for the <code>chain</code> array. Indexes for it will be <code>bucket[foobar] - symoffset</code>.</p><p>Chains being contiguous sequences imply that symbols within the same bucket must be stored contiguously. Order of buckets in the symbol table does not really matter but usually they're stored in an ascending order.</p><p>While looking extraneous, creating such restriction over the symbol table gives great advantage: a hash table now can store almost full hash (without the lowest bit) of a symbol within the same 32 bits. This allows linkers to compare hashes before comparing strings. Also, because <code>DT_GNU_HASH</code> requires symbol table ordering and <code>DT_HASH</code> doesn't, you can fit both into a single binary. This way both standard and GNU linkers can look up symbols in it.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Nothing is better than a visual representation of the rules. So, let's create one.</p><p>I took the same symbols as in <a href="https://flapenguin.me/2017/04/24/elf-lookup-dt-hash">ELF: symbol lookup via DT_HASH</a> and created <code>DT_GNU_HASH</code> table from them. The example is for 64-bit ELF binaries, for 32-bit you'll need to recalculate bloom word and bits.</p><pre>nbuckets = 4      (because I decided that there will be four buckets)
symoffset = 1    (STN_UNDEF is not a part of the hash table)
bloom_size = 2   (because I decided that 16 byte bloom filter is sufficient)
bloom_shift = 5  (again, just because I can)

				<p><em>Whatever else happens, you made a movie… Nobody can take that away. A hundred years from now, when we're all dead and gone, people will be watching this fucking thing.</em></p>
<p><em>– <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Soprano">Tony Soprano</a> to his nephew (whom he murders over this movie in a few episodes)</em></p>
<p>So I made a 90-second animated, um, I guess it's a blog post. I don't know about a hundred years from now, but I proudly invite you to watch the fucking thing right now:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xTOHyWphzFc" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I hear that it's considered classy for animators, filmmakers and such to let their work stand on its own, either refraining from commentary or making it vague. However, anxious to secure my spot in eternity, I decided to rush my immortal masterpiece out the door, so I cut everything I could.</p>
<p>I then realized that I left out a delicate point which, despite my embarrassment, I must mention. Luckily, typing is much easier than animating, so the following afterthought was quick to put down [1]. Here goes.</p>
<p>The short isn't exactly a documentary, but real-life me did switch to a part-time job to free some time for animating, drawing, etc. I figured this mundane little step was a good topic for a starting filmmaker because it turned out to be surprisingly controversial. Here are some of the reactions I received:</p>
<ul>
<li>"So you finally got fed up with the job?"</li>
<li>"Part-time? But everyone here <em>needs</em> you!"</li>
<li>"Wow, I'm jealous! I want to work less, too. They pay you the same, right?" No, they pay less, I said. "Oh. Ha-ha. Work less, get less. Interesting!"</li>
<li>"You should really work more, not less, while you're young. Futurists predict a huge global pension crisis, so save for your retirement!"</li>
<li>"I doubt this will fly with the big deadline coming. Who's gonna do all the work? Not me!" (This guy works part-time himself – very productively.)</li>
<li>"Doesn't your wife object?" (Actually, my light table is Rachel's gift. I don't know when/if I'd ever get one on my own.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments suggest that many people want to work less, but something is keeping them from doing it. I can certainly relate to that. It took me 10 years to decide to work part-time – and then <em>5 more years to actually do it</em>.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard?</p>
<p>My own reasons mostly revolve around money. Where I live, money is much easier to make programming than animating (good luck even finding a half-stable job working on animated features.)</p>
<p>Hence "I went into programming for the money", as I said in the short – as I always say. And initially I figured I'd work all I can and retire early – the opposite of working part-time and animating in my spare time ("settling for a fraction of the dream"). And you've just seen how I changed my mind.</p>
<p>But there's another thing, which I usually<em> don't </em>say and which I must reluctantly admit. You see, I came for the money, and then I started liking the <em>getting paid</em> part.</p>
<p>What's the difference between money and getting paid? There's a world of difference!</p>
<p>Winning a lottery is a way to obtain money without getting paid for a service. And spending your wage on designer clothes is a way to get paid without having any money left. The difference is this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money</strong> lets you buy things – food, living space, spare time, etc. It's about <strong>options</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Getting paid</strong> tells you the value of your service to whoever paid you. It's about <strong>achievement</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like getting paid, I must admit despite the embarrassment.</p>
<p>Note that I'm not ashamed in the slightest to like money (options) and to have chosen a profession with the sole purpose of maximizing income.</p>
<p>Some people believe that you can't be happy doing something you don't love – and that you can't be any good at it, hence you won't make that much money, either. I disagree.</p>
<p>I'll tell you who my role model is, as a computer programmer. It's neither Bill Gates nor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_stallman">Richard Stallman</a>. My role model is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>, whom you probably remember as Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars. Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote><p>In letters to his friends, Guinness described the film as "fairy tale rubbish" &lt;…&gt;</p>
<p>He was one of the few cast members who believed that the film would be a box office hit;&nbsp; he negotiated a deal for 2% of the gross royalties &lt;…&gt;</p>
<p>Lucas and fellow cast members … have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, both on and off the set. Lucas &lt;said&gt; that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's a man working on something he disliked because it paid – and delighting his target audience and colleagues alike. To me it shows that "extrinsic motivation" – money – is a perfectly good primary motivation, contrary to <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/07/09/extrinsic-motivations-are-harmful/">some researchers' conclusions</a>.</p>
<p>I'm in it for the money – hence, I'll never get bored and lose interest, as long as there's money to be made. I'll dutifully work on the unpleasant parts necessary to get things actually done (and get paid). Not liking programming that much, I try to keep my programs short and easy to maintain and extend – so I can program less.</p>
<p>These are all desirable traits – and not everyone genuinely loving programming has them. Think about it. Who's the better henchman – the psychopath murdering for the thrill, or the coldblooded killer who's in it for an early retirement? Same thing here.</p>
<p>I'm your perfect henchman. Pay me, give me some time alone with your computers, and when you come back, you'll find them doing your bidding. Of this I am not ashamed.</p>
<p>Recently, however, I noticed that I'm no longer the coldblooded henchman I used to be, that I started to enjoy the thrill of the kill for its own sake. And this I cannot admit without blushing.</p>
<p>That's what getting paid does to the weak-minded. It warped my value system. The phases of my transition – or should I say my moral decay – went something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I program because they pay me.</li>
<li>Programming is good because they pay me.</li>
<li>Programming is good.</li>
<li>Programming is good! I think I'll go program right now. Or read about it. Or write something about it. All in my spare time.</li>
</ol>
<p>And there you have it. <strong>"Achievement" has been redefined to mean "that thing you get paid for".</strong></p>
<p>This is how I ended up with a website dedicated largely to programming. Then a programming blog on the site and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/blogs-1/nf/Yossi_Kreinin.php">a similar blog elsewhere</a>. Then came the ultimate downfall: <a href="https://github.com/yosefk">open-source programs on GitHub</a>, written during evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>And I don't regret the writing. Keeping readers' attention on my very dry programming-related subjects is a worthy challenge for any starting storyteller.</p>
<p>But <em>programming for free? Me?</em> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/quotes">If you're good at something, never do it for free!</a> Oh, how the weak-minded have fallen.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom to begin rising. So it was with me. Realizing that I've just programmed for free for several weekends in a row made me think. Hard.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you," I said to myself. "All this money-chasing at least made some sense. But programming for free? Why not <em>draw</em> in your spare time instead? What's <em>wrong </em>with you?"</p>
<p>"Not so fast," said self. "For free or not, at least here you are doing something you're good at. You know you're good – you get paid for it! Would they pay you for drawing? Not so soon. Maybe never. Even if you're any good. <strong>In fact you'll never know if you're any good. </strong>Not if you're never paid. Nor if you're paid badly, which happens all the time in those arty parts of the world, even to the best. Why not stick to things you're <em>good</em> at – that you <em>know </em>you're good at?"</p>
<p>Could you believe this guy? Well, I wouldn't have any of that.</p>
<p>"You shameless, hypocritical, baiting-and-switching COWARD," I screamed at self at the top of my lungs. "You always said programming was for the money – to buy time, to buy that bloody creative freedom you kept chattering about! And now you say I should keep programming because I got good at it? But of course I got good – I've been doing it all this time! I could have gotten just as good at drawing – <strong>I still can</strong> – if I have the time!"</p>
<p>"And you say that now when I can afford some spare time," I went on, "I should regardless stick to what I'm good at, which by now is programming? Are you hinting that I won't ever draw very well? Is <em>that </em>why you suggested a career in programming in the first place – because you didn't believe I could draw? Was that chanting about needing money one big lie all along? Tell me, you lying bastard! I'm gonna -"</p>
<p>"OK, OK, chill, man, CHILL!" Self looked scared and unsettled. He clearly didn't see it coming. Now he was looking for some way to appease me. "You know," said self, "maybe you're right. Remember how you're always proud of taking a long-term view? Of how you care today about things 5, even 10 years ahead?"</p>
<p>I smiled smugly. Indeed I was proud of my long-term-centered, strategic thinking. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Colwell">Bob Colwell</a> – the legendary computer architect – once said that it's the architect's duty to think about the long term, because nobody else will. I <em>so</em> identified with that. (Colwell and I are both computer architects, you see – just, um, of different calibers.)</p>
<p>"Well," said self, "you <em>should</em> be proud. Too many lose sight of the future because of today's small but pressing worries!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, yeah." I was losing my patience. "Thanks but no thanks for your brown-nosing. Listen, are you playing bait and switch on me again? What does this have to do with drawing?"</p>
<p>"But that's the point – it's the same thing," self exclaimed, "it's about long-term thinking! Sure, in the short term, maybe you're better at programming than drawing.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Server cost is usually not a concern for most funded startups, but for a boot strapped SaaS product like ours,&nbsp; it was important to have an AWS bill that is easy on the pocket and a little more proportional to the MRR.</p><p>‍</p><p>To that end when we started<a href="http://superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> superlemon.xyz</a> one of the first things I did was to find ways to consume the least amount of resources on the cloud. We currently serve a traffic of ~ 250 requests per second with our AWS setup.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Most applications require certain common cloud resources and these include</p><p>‍<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Compute instances</li><li>Database instances</li><li>Caching instances</li><li>CDN&nbsp;</li><li>A web server that acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><div><p>I will now go through each of these resources and talk about both the expensive way and the cheap way to implement them</p></div><p><strong>Compute instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>When it comes to compute instances, most people go with AWS EC2 instances. EC2 instances are the safest choice to make for running server applications as they are highly configurable, scalable and you can change the configuration on demand according to your needs. However, sometimes you do not really need this level of control on your compute instances and that brings us to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail/" target="_blank">AWS Lightsail</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Lightsail as the name suggests is a lightweight version of EC2. Under the hood Lightsail instances are actually EC2 instances, but this is not apparent to the user and unlike the highly configurable EC2, Lightsail comes with a fixed configuration that once you provision cannot be changed. The billing is also a fixed amount per month as opposed to EC2 which is billed by the hour.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>To give you a sense of how much less complicated Lightsail is, please take a look at these screenshots of the EC2 dashboard and Lightsail dashboard.</p><figure id="w-node-7afe1c2bdee3-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef82a451ea3cd05dfd4c146_x93boOZlEeQGL9kcVSXPZyGOX3SNQJfDNyRC0qG3jNDCYeySdZpIgBzYgkVDZqq3DhR92f_Eqdp8sG-vIgkwltIW9ExWhshfDSsb-gd2qCah6E5VjydVhGxO4QFRA5qCR2KXqhP5.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-2074947a61a8-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef737f4a33047deb1c0a4a6_ZMr0t2QqxGgPZ-Grg-TIHjpok_ujhoYzyHLQnsGzlSfLJj0wRrKWFMKNnVDwCoOorYJHs6j4aqKz_NgztOFGNSNc9Fw4nKGrwSRVK7E4hQtDkzE7OXIVaQp0lDjXxwjiKkHN1e3c.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>EC2 dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>But we are not here to debate the complexity of EC2 vs Lightsail, so let’s let us talk about the cost.</p><p>An EC2 instance with 2 virtual cores, 4GB RAM and a storage of 80GB costs roughly 37$ a month and a Lightsail instance with the exact same configuration costs 20$ a month which is almost half the cost!</p><p>‍<br></p><p>The only drawback here as previously mentioned is that the instance is fixed and neither the storage nor the compute power can be tweaked later according to spikes in traffic and usage.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>In our case we do not have a need for too much storage on the compute instance, and as for the computing power it was easy for us to simply provision another Lightsail instance when there is an increase in traffic and set it up behind a load balancer. This way our system is still scalable.</p><p><strong>Database instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Choosing a database provider for your application can be a tricky decision, but on a high level there is just one thing that is absolutely required for any database provider - the ability to take regular backups of the DB automatically and the ability to restore the database from one of the backups.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this functionality is provided by AWS RDS along with an array of other capabilities like autoscaling of storage, multiple availability zones, etc. However we did not not really need this level of control over the DB for our simple SaaS product, not to mention the fact that RDS would cost us a minimum of 200$ a month with the lowest acceptable configuration.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again our saviour was Lightsail which provides managed Databases with a fixed storage at very cheap prices. Only MySQL and PostgreSQL are available though which was fine with us since I am quite comfortable with MySQL. We have currently provisioned one MySQL DB with 2 vCPUS, 4GB RAM and 120GB SSD and it costs us 60$ a month.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>And as mentioned before Lightsail provides the basic capabilities of backups and restoration.</p><figure id="w-node-e1f43dee380f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef731c812136072299e133c_Q2n6wprxbcqgh5vI97YqjWYkOYV52HGzRtHXIQFfpgxwlHkGaO8YDv3aO3V-PwM2SI4qxPty6ZMlK0siv1-lAizSl9hf_6RASDqzNrSfEmIeMdu8UeSTsRhu4Sk1Ofg6Uw8CPPuK.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Database restoration from recent backup</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><div><p>The drawback here is that the DB will not scale automatically so your will have to make sure that your application does not use storage beyond what is available in the instance you select. We do this by regularly purging our Database of data that is older than X days and data that belongs to users who churned from our app more than X days ago and haven’t come back since.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Caching instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>For our application we needed a Caching layer as well as the ability to queue up jobs that can be executed asynchronously. The seasoned folks here might have realised that the best tool to use for this is Redis and AWS has a service called ElastiCache which is Redis under the hood.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again this would be a very safe choice to make because it is completely managed and scalable. Our need was a Redis instance with at least 6GB of memory and 2vCPUs and if we went with ElastiCache our cost would roughly come out to be 112$ a month, not to mention the additional cost of running our async workers somewhere else.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>I might sound like a broken record at this point but what we ended up doing was to provision a Lightsail instance with 2vCPUs and 8GB of memory for the cost of 40$ a month and installed an open source version of Redis on this instance. We also use the same instance to run our asynchronous workers which read from the Redis queue and execute jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So what is the drawback? Well since it is not a managed service, you would have to monitor the Redis server yourself. There are many tools out there that help you do this and the one I would recommend is<a href="http://prometheus.io/" target="_blank"> prometheus.io</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This means that you have to do a little bit of extra work to setup metrics collection from your Redis instance and use a grafana dashboard where you can view these metrics, but this extra work saves a lot of money in the long run and you get to look at a super cool dashboard like this one</p><figure id="w-node-ed9ef23d383f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b6832df460f9189c1ef_8fAYGJqB0CXvglSTkg-wXPXqpKi2e3fusNyMcOaiepfnZ-dC1kjn2Do44sILw5lbKOSISB1CMTEdCzyqBcyggDwK4tJcDEA17xkWXb2J1tUjLHBJgtMa_t3ekfIUfOiImx5IaZd6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Grafana dashboard for monitoring redis instance</figcaption></figure><p><strong>CDN</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Our application requires a javascript file to be loaded into the websites of our customers. This JS file gets a ton of traffic because this traffic scales according to how many visitors our customers get. Now this can be scary because it means we really had no idea how many requests the JS file might actually end up receiving so we hesitated to go with CloudFront which is the goto solution for a CDN on AWS.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So we ended up taking an entirely different approach for this. Our application is a Shopify app and during the process of building the application we created a Shopify store. Every Shopify store gets its own personal CDN where you can manually upload anything and it will be served over the Shopify CDN. So we minified and uploaded our JS file to the CDN of our Shopify store and now we serve 20000 Shopify stores using this method at zero cost.</p><figure id="w-node-78b80f124ebd-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b68374cfd3932d127f5_z2vfALB6_5FJXMp4al-65PIczwKOE-wUb0TubqBXAFMiu0rnqPEKGAOl12Saf0Xn-Ay1DjWL7wIj7Vby1sNPfLHkpuXzHf17ytoJ5gQvql13DZl1BsIV2rJPeHgfnCnIdezWiddG.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Shopify CDN&nbsp;that is free of cost</figcaption></figure><p>There is a glaring drawback to this approach. The Shopify store CDN does not provide an API that you can use to programmatically upload files and it has to be done manually. Also unlike CloudFront, there is no option of invalidating a file once it is uploaded. So If you have to make updates to your file you would have to upload a new file and migrate all of your existing users to this new file.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p>This might sound like a big drawback, but it actually took me an hour to whip up a script that updates the JS file for all our existing 20000 stores to the updated JS file that I provide. So whenever I make a new release to this JS file, I simply upload a new file manually to the CDN, then take that file as the input and run this script and we re live! This approach works for us because we do not make too many releases to the JS&nbsp;file to begin with.</p><p><strong>Web server + load balancer</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Every application requires the ability to route requests coming to their domain or subdomain to various applications running under the hood. The best way to do this is to use AWS ELB which can be used to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This sounds quite fancy, but all we needed for our product was 4 things</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Serving static files for our application dashboard</li><li>Distribute traffic among different Lightsail instances based on the path of the incoming URL</li><li>Load balance traffic that comes from our Merchants Shopify stores amongst N identical Lightsail instances.</li><li>Rate limiting of requests to prevent DDOS attacks.</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this can be done using NGINX which is a great piece of software and is quite robust even with the default settings that it comes with.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we simply installed a stable version of NGINX on one of our existing Lightsail instances which was already being used to host one of our server applications. We also use<a href="http://amplify.nginx.com/" target="_blank"> amplify.nginx.com</a> for monitoring it. This setup is pretty much equivalent to using a managed service at zero cost.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-26b2c44e15ee-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef730c34b26677e785fa7ea_w67-tKkFsy_LekSEhO_PXqnHGxDiREqENBgMBaEAOqotyjEDJoKXRk6Wpd5K86OOv2z_S-ejGOnL37l6lj6MWqE_x2ZvrIZ4FCQraAC1uDWMne7yi0Fme4Jap2sp2uH2zrKdvpTz.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Amplify dashboard for monitoring health of the NGINX server</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Use lightsail instances (20$ per instance) instead of EC2 instances (37$ per instance)</li><li>Use a lightsail database (60$ per DB) instead of RDS (200$ per DB)</li><li>Use a self hosted redis server on a compute instance (40$) instead of ElastiCache (112$)&nbsp;</li><li>If feasible, use a free CDN (cost savings depends on traffic size)</li><li>Use a self hosted NGINX server (20$ fixed cost) instead of ELB (cost depends on traffic and usage)</li></ul><p><strong>Closing notes</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I would like to put emphasis on the fact that we are a micro-SaaS product that solves a small and specific use case and therefore this kind of AWS setup worked for us.

We have been running this product for a little over 1 year with this AWS setup and so far we have not encountered any problems.</p></div></div>]]>

            <span> Jun 26, 2020</span>
            
                <a href="https://blog.mostlypointless.dev/tags/linux">linux</a>
            
                <a href="https://blog.mostlypointless.dev/tags/raspberry-pi">raspberry pi</a>
            
        
        <p>Almost two months ago, I started building a four node Raspberry Pi 4 cluster for a project I’m working on. Figuring out the best way to get Linux on each node lead me down a rabbit hole and I spent the next four weeks <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html">yak shaving</a>.</p>
<p>The most common way to boot a Pi is from an SD card. But they are slow and unreliable - I don’t like them. Certain models of Pi 2 and Pi 3 support <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md">booting from USB storage</a>, but Pi 4 cannot do that yet. So, I’m stuck with using an SD card for each Pi. Or so I thought.</p>
<h3 id="enter-pxe-boot">Enter PXE boot</h3>
<p>Turns out, Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 also <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net.md">support network booting</a>. A beta firmware was released late last year that enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a> for Pi 4. I found <a href="https://linuxhit.com/raspberry-pi-pxe-boot-netbooting-a-pi-4-without-an-sd-card">an article on LinuxHit</a> detailing the process of installing the firmware and setting up network boot.</p>
<p>Just to test this out, I updated the firmware and configured PXE server on one of the Pis. I tried booting another Pi over the network and…it worked!
Here is the gist of PXE server setup process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the contents of <code>/boot</code> and the rest of <code>/</code> into separate folders on your local filesystem. I copied mine to <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Install and configure <code>dnsmasq</code> to enable TFTP and use <code>/tftp</code> as <code>tftp-root</code></li>
<li>Install and configure NFS server to share <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code></li>
<li>Edit the contents of <code>/nfs/raspbian-root/fstab</code> to mount the boot partition.</li>
<li>Edit <code>/nfs/raspbian-boot/cmdline.txt</code> to</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/raspbian-root,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><h3 id="pxe-booting-3-nodes-using-overlayfs">PXE booting 3 nodes using OverlayFS</h3>
<p>I cannot just boot all three nodes from the same boot and root filesystems since they are not read-only. And I don’t want to maintain a copy of these for each node. But this is a solved problem - Docker already lets you spin up multiple containers from a single base image. So I’ll just do <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/#how-the-overlay2-driver-works">what Docker does</a> - create <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html">OverlayFS</a> for each node using raspbian-root and raspbian-boot as my lower directories. I’ll share them over NFS like before.</p>
<p>Configuration for one of the nodes is below. Other two nodes follow the same pattern. Note that I moved raspbian-root and raspbian-boot to a USB hard drive (mounted at <code>/mnt</code>) to get better r/w performance. dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX is the MAC address of the node. I’m using <code>tftp-unique-root=mac</code> option in <code>dnsmasq</code> to maintain a separate boot environment for each node based on its MAC address.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ mount -t overlay nog-boot -o lowerdir<span>=</span>/mnt/raspbian-boot,upperdir<span>=</span>/mnt/upper/nog-boot,workdir<span>=</span>/mnt/work/nog-boot -o nfs_export<span>=</span>on -o index<span>=</span>on -o redirect_dir<span>=</span>nofollow /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX

</code></pre></div><p>(In case you are wondering what <code>nog</code> is: I name my servers after planets from the Star Wars universe. Following this tradition, I’ve named the Pis Mandalore (PXE server), Nog, Ordo and Werda)</p>
<p>You are probably thinking that this worked. It did not.</p>
<p>NFS and OverlayFS did not play nice with each other. After a weekend trying to work around some weird issues, I gave up.</p>
<p>But OverlayFS is not the only copy-on-write filesystem in existence, is it? ZFS and BTRFS offer <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-subvolume">subvolumes and snapshots</a> that I can use instead. But not before I <del>procrastinate</del> spend 2 weeks deciding which one to use.</p>
<h3 id="moving-to-btrfs">Moving to BTRFS</h3>
<p>The plan is simple: I’ll create a subvolume each for raspbian-root and raspbian-boot. I’ll then create three snapshots of each subvolume - one for every node. I created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">btrfs file system</a> on my external drive and ran the following commands</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-root
$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-boot

<span># Repeat the following for each node changing folder names as necessary</span>
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-boot nog-boot
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-root nog-root
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-boot /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-root /nfs/nog

<span># Don’t forget to edit cmdline.txt for each node</span>
$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt
console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/nog,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><p>Well, this worked! I have a Pi running without an SD card!! Now all I have to do is create systemd unit files to start all required services and mount snapshots. I can finally start working on my project.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Take a closer look at the output of <code>cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.
If you are like me, you will realize for the first time that <code>root=</code> in this file defines where the root filesystem will be mounted from. Right now, we are telling it to mount from <code>/dev/nfs</code>. What if I attach an external drive and set <code>root=</code> to point to the external drive?</p>
<h3 id="network-booting-into-a-usb-hard-drive">Network booting into a USB hard drive</h3>
<p>RPi 4 cannot directly boot from a USB drive. As in - it cannot find <code>/boot</code> on a USB drive when powering on. But what if we provide <code>/boot</code> with network boot and mount <code>/</code> from a USB drive using <code>cmdline.txt</code>? Time to test.</p>
<p>I copied raspbian-root to a USB drive, edited <code>fstab</code> to mount <code>/</code> using the partition’s PARTUUID and connected it to Nog. I then updated the contents of <code>/tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt

</code></pre></div><p>After a couple of reboots, it worked! I now have a RPi 4 running off a USB hard drive!</p>
<h3 id="what-did-i-gain">What did I gain?</h3>
<p>Let’s start with what I was looking for. All I wanted was to not deal with SD cards because they are slow and unreliable. Reliability is relative - everything fails at some point. But a decent quality USB hard drive will likely outlive an SD card. So let’s just look at some read/write performance numbers and see how they compare.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sync; dd <span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero of<span>=</span>twogeefile bs<span>=</span>1M count<span>=</span>2048; sync  <span># Write performance</span>

<p>With network boot, I was able to get read and write speeds similar to a class 10 SD card. Note that the boot images are hosted on a USB hard drive connected to Mandalore (PXE server). NFS seems to be the bottleneck here - raw r/w speeds of the hard drive are much better than this. All Pis are connected to Netgear’s 8 port gigabit ethernet switch.</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, things improve considerably when Pis are running off a USB hard disk. Note that the external drives I used are 5400RPM hard disks repurposed from very old MacBooks. I bought them on eBay for $10 a pop. YMMV.</p>
<h3 id="current-setup">Current setup</h3>
<p>Right now, I have Mandalore booting from an SD card and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk. Nog, Ordo and Werda fetch <code>/boot</code> from Mandalore over the network and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk.</p>

<p>I can finally start working on my proj… wait, what?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/boot-raspberry-pi-4-usb">A new beta firmware is out for RPi 4 that lets you boot from USB drives directly.</a></p>
<p>Oh well…</p>
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> This post was discussed on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23666564">Hacker News</a>. As jordybg <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23667247">points out</a>, USB boot is no longer “beta” and is available in the latest (2020-06-15) “stable” firmware release.</em></p>

   <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
   <p>This specification uses pluggable protocols, with QUIC <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-quic-transport">[QUIC-TRANSPORT]</a> as
one such protocol, to send data to and receive data from servers. It can be
used like WebSockets but with support for multiple streams, unidirectional
streams, out-of-order delivery, and reliable as well as unreliable transport.</p>
   <p role="note"><span>Note:</span> The API presented in this specification represents a preliminary proposal
based on work-in-progress within the IETF QUIC WG. Since the QUIC transport
specification is a work-in-progress, both the protocol and API are likely to
change significantly going forward.</p>
   <h2 data-level="2" id="conformance"><span>2. </span><span>Conformance</span><a href="#conformance"></a></h2>
   <p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines,
diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
   <p>The key words <em>MUST</em> and <em>SHOULD</em> are to be interpreted as described in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
   <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product:
the user agent that implements the interfaces that it contains.</p>
   <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
   <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this
specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript
Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-webidl">[WEBIDL]</a>, as this
specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

 many datagrams are queued because the stream is not being read quickly
 enough, drop datagrams to avoid queueing. Implementations should drop older
 datagrams in favor of newer datagrams. The number of datagrams to queue
 should be kept small enough to avoid adding significant latency to packet
 delivery when the stream is being read slowly (due to the reader being slow)
 but large enough to avoid dropping packets when for the stream is not read
 for short periods of time (due to the reader being paused).</p>

  <p>Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with security by default. Deno tends to substitute Node.js with a simpler, modern, and more secure runtime.</p>
<p>Deno is built on V8, Rust, and <a href="https://tokio.rs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Tokio homepage">Tokio</a>, a Rust asynchronous runtime environment. It aims to be a productive and secure scripting environment for the modern world of programming, Deno is for you!</p>
<p>If you want to learn Deno you are in the right section.</p>
<p>Our Deno tutorial is designed for simplicity. We also have tons of examples to get you in the game.</p>
<h2>Deno Example Code</h2>
<pre><code>function generateRandom(max_number) {
  return Math.ceil(Math.random() * max_number);
}

console.log(generateRandom(5));</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://lyty.dev/diy/deno-typescript-random-number-example.html" target="_blank"><i>launch</i>&nbsp; Do It Yourself</a></p>
<h2>What Can Deno Do?</h2>
<p>Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime environment, this means that you can use Deno to process server-side actions by writing JavaScript or TypeScript. Think of anything that other server-side programming languages can do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deno can <strong>serve</strong> web pages dynamically (like PHP, NodeJS, ASP, and other server-side languages).</li>
<li>Deno can <strong>create</strong>, <strong>open</strong>, <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong>, <strong>delete</strong>, and <strong>close</strong> files on the server</li>
<li>Deno can be used to <strong>build</strong> command-line based applications</li>
<li>Deno can <strong>interact</strong> with any kind of database</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Use Deno?</h2>
<p>Think of anything other server-side programming languages can do, then think <strong>security</strong>, <strong>simplicity</strong>, and <strong>modernization </strong>with Deno.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security by default. No file, network, or environment access (unless explicitly enabled).</li>
<li>It is a TypeScript runtime, which means it supports TypeScript out of the box.</li>
<li>Comes with a single executable (<code>deno</code>).</li>
<li>Ships with built-in tools that make code inspection and formatting easy,&nbsp; the <code>deno info</code> and <code>deno fmt</code>.</li>
<li>You can bundle scripts into a single JavaScript file and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who Can Learn Deno?</h2>
<p>Deno can be learned by anyone, provided that you have the basic knowledge of <strong>JavaScript </strong>especially about <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>
<h2>Comparisons to Node.js</h2>
<div><table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Deno</td>
<td>NodeJS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No package manager. Uses modules referenced as URLs or file paths</td>
<td>Has a package manager called <code>npm</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deno does not use <code>package.json</code> in its module resolution algorithm</td>
<td>Uses <code>package.json</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All async actions in Deno return a promise. Thus Deno provides different APIs than Node.</td>
<td>In Node.js, async can be promise or function-based</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deno requires explicit permissions for file, network, and environment access (for security purposes).</td>
<td>Node.js does not require this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deno always dies (exits) on uncaught errors</td>
<td>Node.js may not die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Uses "ES Modules" and does not support <code>require()</code>. Third-party modules are imported via URLs: <code>import * as log from "https://deno.land/std/log/mod.ts";</code></td>
<td>Node.js uses both <code>require()</code> and the ES <code>import</code>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>You can start our Deno Tutorial by clicking the 'Next Chapter' button below.</p>
<h2>What You Should Know at the End of This Lesson</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should understand when <strong>Deno</strong> is.</li>
<li>You should understand the core value of <strong>Deno </strong>(security, speed, and modern).</li>
<li>You should know that <strong>Deno </strong>is TypeScript-code and the standard file extensions are <code>.js</code> and&nbsp;<code>.ts</code></li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The language of mathematics is distinct from natural languages in that it aims to communicate abstract, logical ideas with precision and unambiguity. As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think. In fact, in what follows, we’ve compiled a list of 106 such terms — along with some in-depth exploration of their <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>implications</strong>.</p><p>So if you’re ready to dive into this fascinating world that is known as mathematics, then let’s get started!</p><p>(and if you’re looking for a concise rendition of all the 106 terms featured in this glossary, then you might find the following <strong>higher math jargon mindmap</strong> both interesting and useful.)</p> <p><span><a href="#" target="_self"><span><strong>Download the 4-Page Higher Mathematical Jargon Mindmap</strong></span></a></span></p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png" alt="The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargons" width="1366" height="702" srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png 1130w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-600x308.png 600w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-768x395.png 768w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-1024x526.png 1024w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" title="Math Glossary Header Image" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201366%20702'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png 1130w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-600x308.png 600w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-768x395.png 768w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-1024x526.png 1024w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image-300x154.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png"></p><h2 id="toc">Higher Mathematical Jargon — The Definitive List (106 Terms)</h2><p><span> The definitive glossary of higher mathematical jargon — from abstract nonsense, elementary proof to singularity and 101+ more. </span> <span><span>Click to Tweet</span><i></i></span></p><h2 id="abstraction"><a href="#toc">Abstraction</a></h2><p>The process of extracting the underlying <strong>structures</strong>, <strong>patterns</strong>, or <strong>properties</strong> of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects.

For example, one might say that:</p><ul><li>“$\mathbb{R}$ is distributive” — rather than “$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is distributive.”</li><li>“$3$ is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $x \mapsto 3$ for all real $x$, is differentiable.”</li><li>“$a+b+c = c+b+a$” — rather than “$(a+b) + c = (c+b) + a$”.</li></ul><p>In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a <strong>misuse of notation</strong> — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$).</p><h2 id="algo"><a href="#toc">Algorithm</a></h2><p>A finite series of <a href="#welldefined">well-defined</a>, <strong>computer-implementable instructions</strong> to solve a specific set of computable problems. It takes a finite amount of initial input(s), processes them unambiguously at each operation, before returning its outputs within a finite amount of time. Some examples of algorithm in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong> (for finding the greatest common factor of two natural numbers)</li><li><a href="https://mathvault.ca/long-division">The <strong>long division algorithm</strong> (and its variants)</a></li><li>The <strong>simplex algorithm</strong> (for finding the optimal solution under a set of linear constraints)</li></ul><p>In essence, algorithms are created to streamline the solution-finding process for a specific set of problems, though it can also remove the necessity of thinking and understanding in the process.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A bit more than four years ago I started the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">xi-editor</a> project. Now I have placed it on the back burner (though there is still some activity from the open source community).</p>

<p>The original goal was to deliver a very high quality editing experience. To this end, the project spent a rather large number of “novelty points”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rust as the implementation language for the core.</li>
  <li>A rope data structure for text storage.</li>
  <li>A multiprocess architecture, with front-end and plug-ins each with their own process.</li>
  <li>Fully embracing async design.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> as a mechanism for concurrent modification.</li>
</ul>

<p>I still believe it would be possible to build a high quality editor based on the original design. But I <em>also</em> believe that this would be quite a complex system, and require significantly more work than necessary.</p>

<p>I’ve written the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">CRDT part of this retrospective</a> already, as a comment in response to a Github issue. That prompted good <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">discussion</a> on Hacker News. In this post, I will touch again on CRDT but will focus on the other aspects of the system design.</p>

<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>

<p>The original motivation for xi came from working on the Android text stack, and confronting two problems in particular. One, text editing would become very slow as the text buffer got bigger. Two, there were a number of concurrency bugs in the interface between the EditText widget and the keyboard (input method editor).</p>

<p>The culprit of the first problem turned out to be the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/SpanWatcher">SpanWatcher</a> interface, combined with the fact that modern keyboards like to put a spelling correction span on each word. When you insert a character, all the successive spans bump their locations up by one, and then you have to send onSpanChanged for each of those spans to all the watchers. Combined with the fact that the spans data structure had a naive O(n) implementation, and the whole thing was quadratic or worse.</p>

<p>The concurrency bugs boil down to synchronizing edits across two different processes, because the keyboard is a different process than the application hosting the EditText widget. Thus, when you send an update (to move the cursor, for example) and the text on the other side is changing concurrently, it’s ambiguous whether it refers to the old or new location. This was handled in an “almost correct” style, with timeouts for housekeeping updates to minimize the chance of a race. A nice manifestation of that is that swiping the cursor slowly through text containing complex emoji could cause flashes of the emoji breaking.</p>

<p>These problems have a unifying thread: in both cases there are small diffs to the text, but then the data structures and protocols handled these diffs in a less than optimal way, leading to both performance and correctness bugs.</p>

<p>To a large extent, xi started as an exploration into the “right way” to handle text editing operations. In the case of the concurrency bugs, I was hoping to find a general, powerful technique to facilitate concurrent text editing in a distributed-ish system. While most of the Operational Transformation literature is focused on multiple users collaboratively editing a document, I was hoping that other text manipulations (like an application enforcing credit card formatting on a text input field) could fit into the general framework.</p>

<p>That was also the time I was starting to get heavily into Rust, so it made natural sense to start prototyping a new green-field text editing engine. How would you “solve text” if you were free of backwards compatibility constraints (a huge problem in Android)?</p>

<p>When I started, I knew that Operational Transformation was a solution for collaborative editing, but had a reputation for being complex and finicky. I had no idea how deep the rabbithole would be of OT and then CRDT. Much of that story is told in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">CRDT discussion</a> previously linked.</p>

<h2 id="the-lure-of-modular-software">The lure of modular software</h2>

<p>There is an extremely long history of people trying to build software as composable modules connected by some kind of inter-module communication fabric. Historical examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCE/RPC">DCE/RPC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture">Corba</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo_(GNOME)">Bonobo</a>, and more recently things like <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">Sandstorm</a> and <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/modular/module">Fuchsia Modular</a>. There are some partial successes, including <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Binder">Binder</a> on Android, but this is still mostly an unrealized vision. (Regarding Binder, it evolved from a much more idealistic vision, and I strongly recommend reading this 2006 interview about <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/13674/introduction-to-openbinder-and-interview-with-dianne-hackborn/">OpenBinder</a>).</p>

<p>When I started xi, there were signs we were getting there. Microservices were becoming popular in the Internet world, and of course all Web apps have a client/server boundary. Within Google, <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> was working fairly well, as was the internal process separation within Chrome. In Unix land, there’s a long history of the terminal itself presenting a GUI (if primitive, though gaining features such as color and mouse). There’s also the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> and then, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> and X11.</p>

<p>I think one of the strongest positive models was the database / business logic split, which is arguably the most successful example of process separation. In this model, the database is responsible for performance and integrity, and the business logic is in a separate process, so it can safely do things like crash and hang. I very much thought of xi-core as a database-like engine, capable of handling concurrent text modification much like a database handles transactions.</p>

<p>Building software in such a modular way requires two things: first, infrastructure to support remote procedure calls (including serialization of the requests and data), and second, well-defined interfaces. Towards the end of 2017, I saw the goal of xi-editor as <em>primarily</em> being about defining the interfaces needed for large scale text editing, and that this work could endure over a long period of time even as details of the implementation changed.</p>

<p>For the infrastructure, we chose JSON (about which more below) and hand-rolled our own xi-rpc layer (based on JSON-RPC). It turns out there are a lot of details to get right, including dealing with error conditions, negotiating when two ends of the protocol aren’t exactly on the same version, etc.</p>

<p>One of the bolder design decisions in xi was to have a process separation between front-end and core. This was inspired in part by <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, in which everything is a plugin, even GUI. But the main motivation was to build GUI applications using Rust, even though at the time Rust was nowhere near capable of native GUI. The idea is that you use the best GUI technology of the platform, and communicate via async pipes.</p>

<p>One argument for process separation is to improve overall system reliability. For example, Chrome has a process per tab, and if the process crashes, all you get is an “Aw, snap” without bringing the whole browser down. I think it’s worth asking the question: is it useful to have the front-end continue after the core crashes, or the other way around? I think probably not; in the latter case it might be able to safely save the file, but you can also do that by frequently checkpointing.</p>

<p>Looking back, I see much of the promise of modular software as addressing goals related to project management, not technical excellence. Ideally, once you’ve defined an inter-module architecture, then smaller teams can be responsible for their own module, and the cost of coordination goes down. I think this type of project management structure is especially appealing to large companies, who otherwise find it difficult to manage larger projects. And the tax of greater overall complexity is often manageable, as these big companies tend to have more resources.</p>

<h3 id="json">JSON</h3>

<p>The choice of JSON was controversial from the start. It did end up being a source of friction, but for surprising reasons.</p>

<p>The original vision was to write plug-ins in any language, especially for things like language servers that would be best developed in the language of that ecosystem. This is the main reason I chose JSON, because I expected there would be high quality implementations in every viable language.</p>

<p>Many people complained about the fact that JSON escapes strings, and suggested alternatives such as <a href="https://msgpack.org/index.html">MessagePack</a>. But I knew that the speed of raw JSON parsing was a solved problem, with a number of extremely high performance implementations (<a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> is a good example).</p>

<p>Even so, aside from the general problems of modular software as described above, JSON was the source of two additional problems. For one, <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-mac/issues/102">JSON in Swift is shockingly slow</a>. There are <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/rearchitecting-jsonencoder-to-be-much-faster/28139">discussions on improving it</a> but it’s still a problem. This is surprising to me considering how important it is in many workloads, and the fact that it’s clearly possible to write a high performance JSON implementation.</p>

<p>Second, on the Rust side, while <a href="https://serde.rs/">serde</a> is quite fast and very convenient (thanks to proc macros), when serializing a large number of complex structures, it bloats code size considerably. The xi core is 9.3 megabytes in a Linux release build (debug is an eye-watering 88MB), and a great deal of that bloat is serialization. There is work to reduce this, including <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/miniserde">miniserde</a> and <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/nanoserde">nanoserde</a>, but serde is still by far the most mainstream.</p>

<p>I believe it’s possible to do performant, clean JSON across most languages, but people should know, we’re not there yet.</p>

<h2 id="the-rope">The rope</h2>

<p>There are only a few data structures suitable for representation of text in a text editor. I would enumerate them as: contiguous string, gapped buffer, array of lines, piece table, and rope. I would consider the first unsuitable for the goals of xi-editor as it doesn’t scale well to large documents, though its simplicity is appealing, and memcpy is fast these days; if you know your document is always under a megabyte or so, it’s probably the best choice.</p>

<p>Array of lines has performance failure modes, most notably very long lines. Similarly, many good editors have been written using piece tables, but I’m not a huge fan; performance is very good when first opening the file, but degrades over time.</p>

<p>My favorite aspect of the rope as a data structure is its excellent …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>My Twitter feels like a local library. Each one of my Twitter friends is tending to their own little corner of the internet, sharing their best material, and responding to my random research questions. There are a lot of knowledgable folks out there, but <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/[@visakanv](https://twitter.com/visakanv">Visakan Veerasamy</a> is the ultimate librarian. I like to think of him as the crown prince of Nerd Twitter —&nbsp;a writer, creator, and curator who’s so prolific he doesn’t recognize himself. Visa is playing the Twitter game on a whole new level. He’s constructing a digital version of his brain, and his curation style feels like an early iteration of something that might one day go mainstream. It’s a knowledge creation and exploration ethos that feels more true to the original “web” and more fit for how we think.</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/visa.png">
<em>Visa’s Twitter profile, complete with his personal web of values.</em></p>

<p>Inspired by his huge web of knowledge, I sent out a tweet three months ago that said: “I think I would legit pay for @visakanv as a service. $10/mo for him to respond to all of my random musings with his own thoughts, content recommendations, and links to relevant threads. This service would be like Mario racing turbo boost for the mind!”</p>

<p>To my surprise, Visa responded within a few minutes. “Happy to do this,” he said, and shared a link to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/visakanv">Patreon</a>.</p>

<h3>A brief history of tweetstorms</h3>

<p>Visa’s digital brain is made up of Twitter threads. He didn’t invent the medium, but he’s pushed it to its limits.</p>

<p>When Marc Andreessen started tweeting in 2014, he didn’t let the 140-character limit stop him from posting his thoughts at length. Instead of shortening his tweets, he started stringing them together by replying to himself. Thus was born the tweetstorm. At first, tweetstorms were a hack. And they were mildly <a href="http://expletiveinserted.com/2014/07/02/taming-tweetstorms/">controversial</a>. Gawker once <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/uber-ceo-posts-13-tweet-apology-without-answering-a-sin-1660229634">slammed</a> Travis Kalanick’s use of a tweetstorm, calling it “a series of thoughts that give the illusion of substance and circumspection because they are presented in a numerical order.” Tech blogger/investor M.G. Siegler raged against them in 2014:</p>

<blockquote><p>1/ In theory, 2/ I love Tweetstorms 3/ and have long wanted a feature like this myself. 4/ But in practice, 5/ I f*cking hate them. 6/ They flow in the tweet stream about as nicely as vomit out of an esophagus. 7/ They ruin the experience of the stream by breaking what Twitter is, 8/ a service to share short thoughts quickly 9/ and let others reply to those in some semblance of order.</p></blockquote>

<p>At first, creating tweetstorms was a <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/08/21/twitter-jargon-illustrated-rt-mt-canoes-darth/">very manual process</a>, and they weren’t very easy to read or share. Fast-forward three years: in 2017, Twitter officially productized tweestorms and rebranded them as “threads.” Suddenly, it was much simpler to string tweets together and share the resulting thread as a unit. This product change created the infrastructure on which Visa and others are currently spinning their webs.</p>

<h3>Resurrecting the Memex</h3>

<p>I found Visa’s threads sometime last year, and I’ve been crawling across them ever since. Whereas Marc Andressen’s threads were mostly self-contained, Visa’s are linked together. They form a giant web of interconnected thoughts. There’s no beginning or ending or map or wayfinding or sense of where you are in his tapestry. There are just threads of threads of threads that seem to extend into infinity —&nbsp;an ever-expanding network of Visa’s ideas and discoveries. At each node, there’s usually a full-on discussion taking place between his followers. Visa has constructed what feels like a whole new medium on top of the bedrock of Twitter. Here’s a representative thread for you to explore:</p>

<blockquote data-lang="en"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’ve been stewing this theory for 1 year +:</p><p>Just as how the WWE isn’t a wrestling show, but a show ABOUT a wrestling show,</p><p>mainstream media is less about the news than a participatory interactive tv show ABOUT the news</p><p>Cable News Network is really Cable News Entertainment <a href="https://t.co/QZO2t8I9fI">https://t.co/QZO2t8I9fI</a></p></div>— Visa is in SF until May 8! 🌉 (@visakanv) <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1004190525270851584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2018</a></blockquote>





<p>Visa’s threads are doing to Twitter what hyperlinks did to dead-tree text. They link things together across time and space. Without thread-webs, most tweets get left behind in the past. A web of tweets allows people to rediscover older thoughts and connect them with newer ones.</p>

<p>These threads bear a family resemblance to the vision of an early 20th-century computer pioneer named Vannevar Bush. In 1945, he wrote a now-famous article called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>, which described a knowledge device he called the Memex:</p>

<blockquote><p>Man cannot hope fully to duplicate [his] mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways, he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed of flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence an clarity of the items resurrected from storage … <strong>Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/memex.jpg"></p>

<p>Bush’s vision of associative trails has been realized in some corners of the web, like Wikipedia. But most content is organized in the reverse-chronological stream (also known as the feed or the timeline). Social media sites have made information consumption a very linear process. We scroll down infinitely long pages that are (roughly) organized from newest to oldest. Content that’s more than a week old is fossilized under the endless dump of new posts, links, pictures. On social media, time is the main ordering principle. Creating new content feels like throwing a leaf into a roaring river. It’s not attached to anything — it just floats on by, doomed to be forgotten within a matter of seconds. We don’t really “surf” the web anymore. Unless we’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikirace">Wiki-racing</a>, we’re not hopping from hyperlink to hyperlink on a surprising journey across  human knowledge. We scroll, click, scroll click.</p>

<p>I see Visa’s Twitter threads as a response to this boring linearity&nbsp;— an attempt to make things hang together. We’re associative beings. We make sense of things by relating them to other things. As Joshua Foer wrote in his book <em>Moonwalking With Einstein:</em> “It takes knowledge to gain knowledge. Memory is like a spiderweb that catches information. The more it catches, the bigger it grows. And the bigger it grows, the more it catches.”</p>

<h3>The spread of threads</h3>

<p>I’ve noticed that the threading impulse is beginning to expand beyond Twitter. It’s popping up in more and more corners of the web. At Ribbonfarm, Venkatesh Rao is experimenting with a new genre called “<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/21/constructions-in-magical-thinking/">blogchains</a>,” in which a bunch of blog posts are linked together around a single theme. It’s different than a traditional series because it’s “improvised rather than planned, is responsive to salient events in the environment, evolves at a certain tempo, is structurally a way to <em>build over time</em>, is suitable for multi-author collaboration, is capable of supporting an inter-process messaging protocol with adjacent blogchains, has no necessary or scripted ‘ending.’” The blogchain seems like a direct descendant of the Twitter thread — an attempt to experiment with the medium outside the confines of Twitter’s more rigid platform.</p>

<p>At Epsilon Theory, Ben Hunt created what he calls a <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/discovery-map-december-31-2018/">Discovery Map</a>. It’s an interactive visualization that displays all 300 of his blog posts as a network graph. The nodes of the network are organized in thematic clusters. Instead of scrolling down a reverse-chronological feed, you can surf across related posts and see connections across time. This feels like a genuinely new way of interacting with blog content, and it serves as an interesting answer to the question “Where should I start?”</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/discovery-map.png"></p>

<p>The most interesting non-linear threading product I’ve discovered is called <a href="http://are.na/">Are.na</a>. It’s like Pinterest, but for nerds. Are.na lets you organize “Blocks” (text, links, photos) into thematic “Channels”. For example, I’m currently collecting material for channels called “<a href="https://www.are.na/aaron-lewis/deep-history-8mjcwnu9nia">Deep history</a>” and “<a href="https://www.are.na/aaron-lewis/culture-wars-2-0">Culture wars 2.0</a>”. Other people can easily add blocks to your channels, and you can include their channels inside your own. Channels can be rearranged, renamed, connected in novel ways. On Are.na, you’re a spider spinning a knowledge web alongside a bunch of other curious spiders. You never know how your webs might connect. I’ve started searching for things on Are.na (instead of Google) because every block lives inside a channel that’s connected to a lot of related content. Whereas a Google search result feels like a dead-end, an Arena block feels like an unexpected beginning.</p>

<p>What’s frustrating about blogging is that each post feels static and final. It’s not very alive as a medium. I wish it were easier for posts to evolve over time, sprout offshoots, find collaborators. The hyperlink is a pretty crude technology for connecting things together. Visa’s threads, Ribbonfarm’s blogchains, Epsilon Theory’s Discovery Map, and Are.na’s channels are all pointing to a model of content creation and consumption that’s more fit for the way our minds actually work. Threads are a more fluid and malleable medium. Finding someone’s thread-web feels like the digital equivalent of perusing the bookshelves in their home. You don’t have to know what you’re looking for, but you’re usually pleasantly surprised by what you find.</p>

<p>For the last few months, Visa has been replying to my tweets with links to his relevant thread-webs. Each random thought I tweet becomes a new entry point into the collection he’s been curating for years. He’d probably do this if I weren’t supporting him on Patreon, but I believe his threading experiment is an extremely valuable service. As the internet grows more complex, we’re going to need people who can string things together across time and …</p></article></section></div>

<p>…or sculpturing is not that bad for health ;P</p>
<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Well, it just had to be this pic:)</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/m346MsE.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/m346MsE.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h4>The story</h4>
<p>Some time ago, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion/Bonzai</a> asked me to fix his SX-64 keyboard. I was like … hell yeah! … I’ve never worked on SX-64 gear. The problem was, at that moment I didn’t know what was wrong with that keyboard … until pics arrived</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion</a> and <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=29175">Yugorin</a> run an awesome website – <a href="https://c64portal.pl/">c64portal.pl</a> – The website is in Polish and contains lots of valuable info about Polish Commodore demoscene and Commodore in general. Both gentlemen are also the main guys behind the <a href="https://moonshinedragons.party/">Moonshine Dragons party – currently, the largest C64 party in Poland.</a></p>
<p>Since I already agreed that I’ll fix it, there was no excuse. Carrion sent me that keyboard and the party has begun 🙂</p>

<h4>Plastic welding and reinforcements</h4>
<p>As it turned out, after close inspection, there were way more cracks than I thought.</p>
<p>All these cracks had to be addressed and reinforced – <a href="https://retrohax.net/extreme-refurbishing-episode-2-atari-800-xl-part-one/">this is a lesson that I’ve learned after my Atari 800 XL refurb</a> where joints were not stable enough and resulted in tiny cracks over time.</p>
<p>To achieve a proper result, I’ve welded in a brass mesh to serve as a reinforcement of cracked spots and as a base for resin-based compounds used later to rebuild missing plastic. Obviously, the mesh had to be custom cut.</p>
<p>This is how the process looks.</p>

<p>Once every piece was cut to a proper size, I’ve soldered them together. I’ve also added a thicker copper wire to make the mesh stiffer and less prone to bending.</p>

<h4>Rebuilding missing plastic</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was ready to apply fiber-glass putty. This is a quite messy process and looks kinda ugly. I’ve used some old PCB laminate to get every edge correctly positioned and as close to the original as possible. This part boils down to pretty much three things – putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … etc. etc.</p>

<p>After making slots, I could start trying on the bottom part against the top. Unfortunately, one of the hooks snapped off during the process 🙁</p>
<p>I had to fix it first. I’ve made it out of a metal paper clip that was cut down to size and welded in a top case.</p>

<h4>Epoxy resin and finishing</h4>
<p>After all the above work was done, I’ve mixed a cup of thin epoxy resin to fill in hard to access gaps and spots. It also helped to smoothen all uneven surfaces. The resin was applied to all spots with brass mesh with a plastic pipette.</p>

<p>Once the resin cured, I’ve applied a layer of spray putty which helped me to spot all minor mistakes and correct them with finishing putty and 400 grit sandpaper.</p>

<p>After another round of putty and sanding, I’ve applied black undercoating which was then wet-sanded with 1000 grit this time.</p>

<p>Finally, I could apply the last two layers of custom made spray paint. This paint color exactly matches the original. These custom spray paints for various computers will be available in my <a href="https://retrohax.net/">webshop</a> soon. The first series of spray paints will include the following colors:</p>
<ul><li> Atari XL Beige</li><li> Atari XE/ST Gray</li><li> Commodore 64C Beige</li><li> Amiga 500 Beige </li></ul>

<h4>Badges and plastics</h4>
<p>Due to its age, paint from a badge chipped off during removal so I had to fix it. I’ve used a standard black marker to cover all these tiny spots. Later, I’ve removed old glue from the rubber base and applied fresh double-sided adhesive tape on both rubber and badge.</p>

<p>I also had to address other scratched plastic parts. That was easily fixed by applying a thin layer of silicone oil.</p>

<h4>Keyboard cleaning</h4>
<p>Obviously, all keycaps had to be clean. This time, I had to remove every single keycap and clean it individually. It took a while to get it done properly 🙂</p>

<p>Don’t ask me why so late but this is the moment when I’ve realized there is a major failure :/</p>
<p>I’ve no idea why I didn’t spot it earlier. After assembly, it turned out that there is a small gap between parts. It is barely visible and only from a side of the case but I was pissed off at myself that I didn’t spot it and fix it before the case was painted.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/k6m1xzj.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/k6m1xzj.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Obviously, I didn’t have any spray paint left.</p>
<h4>The grand finale</h4>
<p>This restoration was rather time-consuming. It took more or less 15 workdays. This is because I had to wait for chemistry to fully cure before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p>So here it is. Fully restored Commodore SX-64 keyboard for Carrion. Hopefully, he will like it 🙂</p>

      <div><p>Facebook censorship has effectively barred my business from their platform and is materially impacting the livelihood of my customers.</p>
<p>For the past decade, Iâ€™ve run an online portfolio business on the side called <a href="https://foliohd.com/" target="_blank">FolioHD</a>. (You get a subdomain on the platform to host your portfolio, like mine at <a href="http://watilo.foliohd.com/">watilo.foliohd.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have no insight into the offending content, and the offending content can be anything from a nippleÂ&nbsp;to now apparently <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/23/project-veritas-facebook-sting-moderators-brag-abo/" target="_blank">even a MAGA hat</a>.</p>
<p>Now I am personally blocked on Instagram from liking photos or sending DMs. I canâ€™t sign into my company Instagram account. And Facebook has reached into my Pageâ€™s support inbox and removed private message between myself and customers.<br></p><p><b>How I noticed</b></p><p>A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through my personal Instagram and double-tapped a photo. Instead of seeing a red heart, I received this message.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3509ecd9-6aeb-4004-b042-0d782cec404c/Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171501Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=534498c02cd6adf24abad8b4848915ab86e2fc90c2bc390e986a256de8d3e10f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png%22" title="Image: https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3509ecd9-6aeb-4004-b042-0d782cec404c/Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171501Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=534498c02cd6adf24abad8b4848915ab86e2fc90c2bc390e986a256de8d3e10f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png%22"><br></p><p>Tapping â€œTell usâ€� simply says, â€œThanks for reporting this issue.â€�</p>
<p>In my Instagram bio is a link to my personal portfolio, <a href="http://watilo.foliohd.com/">watilo.foliohd.com</a>.

<p>And Facebook should probably never weasel their way into private company inboxes to remove content retroactively. You break the trust of any business by pulling these kind of moves. How can we rely on you for anything if your censorship is a moving target?</p>

<p>We present a simple to use implementation of networking across ultrasonic frequencies, by making use of Gnuradio and a microphone and speakers. This allows you to use <strong>TCP/IP</strong>,<strong>UDP</strong> across an audio link.</p>



<p>In order to follow this tutorial we recommend you use the LiveDVD release of Gnuradio (which is basically a Ubuntu distribution, with gnuradio already installed). This is easily downloadable from <a href="https://gnuradio.org/redmine/news/31">http://gnuradio.org/redmine/news/31</a>. First of all you will need to download the patch we made to Gnuradio, to a USB stick. You can download the patch from <a href="https://github.com/anfractuosity/ultrasonicnetworking/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/anfractuosity/ultrasonicnetworking/archive/master.zip</a>. In order to use the patch, you need to be root, so type <strong>‘sudo bash’</strong>, then unzip the patch, and simply run setup.sh, by typing <strong>./setup.sh</strong>. The setup file simply patches the Gnuradio packet encoder and decoder, in order to support variable length packets.</p>



<p>After running <strong>setup.py</strong>, you can then initialise Gnuradio, which you need to run as root, so do <strong>sudo gnuradio-companion</strong>. And then load a.grc on your first laptop.</p>



<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> depicts our graph which enables us to perform the ultrasonic networking. We will now describe how the graph functions through each block. The first block in the top left, is the TUNTAP PDU, this allows you to create a virtual network interface, through which we can send and receive packets.</p>



<p>We use the “PDU to tagged Stream” block to convert the packets received from the virtual NIC, into a byte stream for the packet encoder to process. We can’t directly attach the output of the tagged stream to the GFSK modulator, as we need to add a checksum, through the use of CRC and also we need to add a preamble and header onto the packet – this is all achieved through the use of the packet encoder.</p>



<p>A preamble is essentially a series of bits, which can be detected at the receiver end, in order to correctly align bits, to the correct byte boundaries. The packet encoder, also adds a header after the preamble, which states how long the packet is, in bytes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1-1024x558.png" alt="Screenshot" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1-1024x558.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1-300x163.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 1</strong><br></p>



<p>The GFSK modulator essentially performs Frequency Shift Keying modulation. As you can see in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, the frequency of the modulated signal is lower, when a ‘0’ is being sent, than a ‘1’ being sent. We found that in the context of ultrasonic networking using laptops and microphones, that FSK performed better than PSK (Phase Shift Keying – which uses phase changes, to communicate bits), which is another modulation technique.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk.png" alt="fsk" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk.png 533w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fsk-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 2 (courtesy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fsk.svg">wikipedia</a>)</strong></p>



<p>A very important aspect of the GFSK block is the number of Samples/Symbol. We set this to a value of 9. This means that for each symbol received by the modulator, 9 samples are generated. The higher this number the more resilient the signal is to noise, but consequentially the lower the baud rate (which essentially means the longer it takes to send packets).<br>Baud rate refers to the number of symbols which are transferred per second.</p>



<p>We then use the rational resampler block, to make the signal further resilient. For every sample in, it generates 320 out.</p>



<p>We use a frequency-translating FIR filter, to translate the frequency of the incoming signal. We shift the signal by -carrier_tx, which is -19kHz in this example. This is so that the signal is just outside of the human range of hearing.</p>



<p>As we have been working with complex signals at this point, we need to convert the complex output into a floating point output for the audio card, we achieve this through the use of a ‘Complex to Real’ block.</p>



<p>The bottom part of the graph, depicts the receiver section of the program. It essentially performs the same functions, but in reverse.<br>However there are two additional blocks after the ‘Float to complex’ block. The multiply const block, allows you to multiply the output from the microphone by a fixed number. The block after this is a bandpass filter, to only allow a small range of frequencies to pass through to the demodulator, this helps remove a large amount of noise which is present from the microphone’s output.</p>



<p>In <strong>Figure 3</strong>, you will see that there are two graphs. The top graph, depicts the output sent to the transmitter and the bottom graph depicts the input received from the microphone (after a bandpass filter has mean applied to it). There is also a slider present at the top which allows you to multiply the signal from the microphone by a specific value. This is useful when using 2 laptops which are a greater distance away from each other.</p>

<p><strong>Fig. 3</strong><br></p>







<p>Figure 4 depicts the full duplex signalling we use. You can see that we transmit in this example at two different frequencies, 19kHz and 18kHz. This allows both laptops to send their own signal simultaneously.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/clip.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/clip.png" alt="clip"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 4</strong><br></p>







<p>In Gnuradio-companion, you will need to go to Build &gt; Execute, in order to execute the graph. You then need to assign an IP address to the tap0 interface it creates for you. You need to do this through a terminal, typing <strong>sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.1.10</strong> for instance.</p>



<p>You need to perform the same steps on your second laptop, B, but instead this time loading b.grc, and using <strong>sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.1.20</strong>.</p>



<p>We found it was best to assign ARP entries manually to each laptop. In order to assign an ARP entry, on laptop A, <strong>arp -s 192.168.1.20 &lt;Laptop B’s MAC address for tap0&gt; -i tap0</strong></p>



<p>The setup script, which you have initialised on both laptops copied the patched files to Gnuradio, as well as modifying TCP options, in order to allow TCP/IP to work across a very laggy network.</p>


<pre title="">echo 100 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries
echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies
echo 100 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_synack_retries
</pre>


<p>The first line is necessary in order to enable a client side TCP connection to stay open longer than the default of 20 seconds, before closing.</p>







<p>In order to test the network is functioning correctly we recommend using netcat. To test out TCP/IP connectivity Use <strong>netcat -vv -l 10000</strong> on Laptop A, and connect to it from Laptop B, using <strong>netcat -vv 192.168.1.10 10000</strong>. Because we are using the verbose options, netcat will inform you when a connection to Laptop A has been established, you can then send text from either laptop to the other one.</p>







<p>As the packet encoder and decoder provided by Gnuradio only work with fixed amounts of data, it was necessary to modify them to support the reading of stream tags. The “PDU to tagged stream” tags packets from the tap interface with their size. The packet encoder/decoder can’t process these tags normally, so we altered the packet encoder, to read these tags, and generate the appropriate sized packet from the tap0 frame. The packet decoder, then unencapsulates the packet, and tags the resulting data, with its size.</p>







<p>To give you an idea of the latencies involved please click on the image below, which shows you a wireshark screenshot, showing the server side of a TCP/IP connection. You’ll see it’s slow!</p>

<p>If anyone’s got any suggestions for improvements to the Gnuradio patch I’d be most appreciative (the patch itself was done very quickly).</p>







<p>The following video is from a previous experiment I did to simply test whether we could send data at 23kHz .</p>



<figure><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/H0DKRl8XIcU" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure>







<p>Minimodem looks like a great program, but as far as I’m aware it supports only FSK. I was keen to try different modulation schemes, which Gnuradio provides many of; I originally tried the setup with PSK.</p>



<p>Also this provided me with an introduction into how some of the techniques used for Software Defined Radio work.</p>



<p><strong>With thanks to the folks on #gnuradio for their help</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>A digital feed is an online stream of content which gets updated as new content is pushed by the feed’s sources. Generally, content is created by users on the social media platform, to be consumed by their followers.</p>
<p>All popular social media platforms feature some type of feed: Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook. Operators of these platforms benefit from increased engagement by their users, so they employ techniques designed to achieve that end. Unfortunately, they often do so at the expense of their users’ well-being. Below are 7 rules to help you retain control over your screen time, without having to leave social media for good, ordered from most important to least important.</p>
<h2 id="rule-1-avoid-non-chronological-feeds">Rule #1: Avoid non-chronological feeds</h2>
<p>On most online platforms, the order of content is determined by an algorithm designed to maximize user engagement, i.e. addict you and keep you looking at ads for as long as possible. Examples: Facebook news feed, Twitter “top tweets”, Instagram explore tab, Tiktok.</p>

<p>Your phone is always within your reach. Access feeds only on your laptop, in order not to condition yourself to constantly check it. Don’t install social media or video apps on your phone.</p>
<h2 id="rule-3-follow-with-purpose">Rule #3: Follow with purpose</h2>
<p>Your digital experience changes with each new person/source you follow. Be mindful about the utility of the information you would obtain before following a new source.</p>
<h2 id="rule-4-limit-the-number-of-peoplethings-you-follow">Rule #4: Limit the number of people/things you follow</h2>
<p>The amount of content you will have to go through increases roughly linearly with the number of sources you follow. You probably won’t see everything your 500 followees share—maybe it’s time to unfollow some of them.</p>
<h2 id="rule-5-schedule-and-limit-your-exposure">Rule #5: Schedule and limit your exposure</h2>
<p>Your brain has a limited capacity to process and hold information. Schedule a certain hour of the day to receive it, and don’t surpass it. Example: No more than 30 minutes of social media, restricted to 10–11 am.</p>
<h2 id="rule-6-block-generously-and-ruthlessly">Rule #6: Block generously and ruthlessly</h2>

<p><span>Initial publication: June 27, 2020</span></p><hr>

<p>
	I've <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previously discussed</a> how the PlayStation 2 doesn't have any good entry-point software exploits for launching homebrew. You need to either purchase a memory card with an exploit pre-installed (or a memory card to USB adapter), a HDD expansion bay (not available to slim consoles), open up the console to block the disc tray sensors, or install a modchip. For the best selling console of all time, it deserves better hacks.
</p>

<p>
	My initial attempt to solve this problem was to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">exploit the BASIC interpreter</a> that came bundeld with early PAL region PS2s. Although I was successful at producing the first software based entry-point exploit that can be triggered using only hardware that came with the console, the attack was largely criticized due to the requirement of having to enter the payload manually through the controller or keyboard, and limitation of being PAL only. I decided to write-off that exploit as being impractical, and so the hunt continued for a better attack scenario for the PlayStation 2.
</p>

<p>
	The PlayStation 2 has other sources of untrusted input that we could attack; games which support online multiplayer or USB storage could almost definitely be exploited. But unlike say the Nintendo 64, where we don't really have any other choice but to resort to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/shogihax.html">exploiting games over interfaces like modems</a>, the PlayStation 2 has one key difference: its primary input is optical media (CD / DVD discs), a format which anyone can easily burn with readily available consumer hardware. This leaves an interesting question which I've wanted to solve since I was a child:
</p>

<p>
	Is it possible to just burn our own homebrew games and launch them on an unmodified console the same way we would launch official discs (without going through any user interaction like disc swapping or triggering a network exploit in a game)?
</p>



<p>
	Ultimately, I was successfully able to achieve my goal by exploiting the console's DVD player functionality. This blog post will describe the technical details and process of reversing and exploiting the DVD player. Loading <a href="#backup">backups of commercial games is also possible</a>. All of my code is <a href="https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot">available on GitHub</a>.

</p>

<br>

<h2>DVD video player attack surface</h2>
<p>
	Obviously we can't just burn a disc containing an ELF file and expect the PS2 to boot it; we'll need to exploit some kind of software vulnerability related to parsing of controlled data. The console supports playing burned DVD video discs, which exposes significant attack surface we could potentially exploit to achieve our goal.
</p>

<p>
	If we think about what a DVD Video consists of there are quite a few main components, each with the potential for vulnerabilities:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>UDF filesystem</li>
	<li>DVD Video metadata / subtitles</li>
	<li>Audio and video decoding</li>
	<li>Interaction machine</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Whilst the complete DVD Video specification is unfortunately behind a paywall, it is comprised largely of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Video_data">open formats like MPEG</a>, just bundled together in a proprietary container format (VOB). For the proprietary aspects there are some freely accessible unofficial references.
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format is probably the simplest format used, and is responsible for storing the metadata that links the video files together.
</p>

<p>
	The interaction machine is what allows for interactive menus and games in DVD Videos. It has <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Inside_DVD-Video/Instruction_Set_Details">32 groups of instructions</a>, and is interesting because it could potentially be used to dynamically manipulate internal memory state to prime an exploit, or it could be used to create a universal DVD with a menu which allows you to select your firmware version and trigger the appropriate exploit.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
	Clearly it's not practical to do most of our testing on the real hardware since burning hundreds of test discs would be wasteful and time inefficient. We need an emulator with some debugger support, which is where we hit our first roadblock: the most popular emulator for PlayStation 2, PCSX2, <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/1981">does not support playing DVD Videos</a>, and no one is interested in adding support.
</p>

<p>
	I'd like to thank krHacken for helping me out with that first roadblock. It turns out that PCSX2 does support the DVD player; it just can't load it automatically since it's located in encrypted storage and PCSX2 does not support the decryption. There are public tools which can <a href="https://github.com/xfwcfw/kelftool">decrypt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jimmikaelkael/eromdir">extract</a> the DVD player from EROM storage. It can then be repacked into an ELF for easy loading into PCSX2.
</p>

<p>
	Due to the large number of different PlayStation 2 models released, each with slightly different DVD player firmwares (&gt; 50...), I will focus on a single DVD player for the duration of this article: 3.10E (configured with English language in PS2 settings), as it happens to be the firmware for the console I own. Update: apparently the 3.10E exploit described here works on 3.10U console with no changes.
</p>

<p>
	I will continue to use Ghidra for decompilation as I've been using throughout my <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previous</a> articles. The DVD player does not contain any symbols so all names in code snippets were assigned by me through reverse engineering.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Disc controlled data</h2>
<p>
	The first file a DVD player will attempt to read is <code>VIDEO_TS.IFO</code>. Searching memory for contents of the file and then setting memory write breakpoints there to track back where it was written we quickly locate the API that reads disc contents used by the IFO parsing code, <code>getDiscByte</code> at <code>0x25c920</code>. It's a stream reader which caches a number of sectors into a RAM buffer, and then automatically seeks more data once needed:
</p>

<pre><code>byte getDiscByte(void) {
	byte ret;
	
	if (currentDiscBytePointer &lt; endDiscBytePointer) {
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	else {
		currentDiscBytePointer = &amp;buffer;
		setOffset = setOffset + numberOfSectorsRead;
		getDiscByteInternal();
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	currentDiscBytePointer = currentDiscBytePointer + 1;
	return ret;
}
</code></pre>



<p>
	From searching calls to this, we can also quickly find wrappers that fetch data of larger sizes: <code>getDiscU16</code> (<code>0x25c980</code>), <code>getDiscU32</code> (<code>0x25c9b8</code>), and <code>getDiscData</code> (<code>0x25c9f0</code>), which is the most interesting as it reads an arbitrary length of data:
</p>

<pre><code>void getDiscData(uint size, byte *destination) {
	byte b;
	uint i;
	
	i = 0;
	if (size != 0) {
		do {
			i = i + 1;
			b = getDiscByte();
			*destination = b;
			destination = destination + 1;
		} while (i &lt; size);
	}
	return;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Large reads</h2>
<p>
	The first thing I did was search for calls to <code>getDiscData</code> in the hope of finding one with controllable size, and no bounds checking.
</p>

<p>
	Sure enough, we very quickly identify about 4 blatant buffer overflow vulnerabilities of this nature. Relating back to the <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format, we can see that there are numerous 16-bit array lengths which are needed to parse the variably sized data structures in the file. The DVD player mistakenly only ever expects the maximum lengths allowed by the DVD specification, and so it is missing checks to reject discs with larger lengths. Since all of the copies are done on statically allocated memory buffers, specifying larger than allowed lengths will cause buffer overflows. For example, below is decompilation for the one at <code>0x25b3bc</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>		large1 = getDiscU16();
		large2 = getDiscU16();
		large3 = getDiscU16();
		ignored = getDiscU16();
		getDiscData(((uint)large1 + (uint)large2 + (uint)large3) * 8, &amp;DAT_0140bdd4);</code></pre>



<p>
	This one is the most interesting because it allows the largest possible copy size (<code>0xffff * 3 * 8 = 0x17FFE8</code> bytes) of all the <code>getDiscData</code> buffer overflows. It copies into the statically allocated buffer at <code>0x0140bdd4</code>, and so by specifying the maximum possible copy size we gain control over the address space from <code>0x140bdd4</code> to <code>0x158BDBC</code> (<code>0x140bdd4 + 0x17FFE8</code>).
</p>

<br>

<h2>Corruption from the large reads</h2>
<p>
	As you can see, we can control quite a large region of memory using the above vulnerability. However, scanning through that memory is initially very disappointing; there are very few pointers, and none of them look particularly interesting to corrupt!
</p>

<p>
	Although there are no interesting pointers in this region, there are some indexes, which if corrupted could lead to further out of bounds memory corruption.
</p>

<p>
	Note that large reads like this won't always copy contiguous data from the IFO file, as sectors will start repeating once we exceed the file size, but generally assume that all data written by a <code>getDiscData</code> call can be controlled as it originates from <i>somewhere</i> on the disc. Also, after writing a certain amount, we may overflow into internal state used by <code>getDiscByte</code> functions, but we will get to this later.
</p>

<br>

<h3>OOB call</h3>
<p>
	At <code>0x25e388</code> we have this call to an entry in a function pointer array, where we can control the 16-bit <code>fpIndex</code> at <code>0x141284a</code> from the overflow:
</p>

<pre><code>(*(code *)(&amp;PTR_LAB_005b9d40)[(uint)fpIndex])(puVar6 + ((uint)DAT_01412841 - 1) * 8);</code></pre>



<p>
	This allows us to jump to the address stored anywhere from <code>0x5b9d40</code> up to <code>0x5b9d40 + 0xffff * 4 = 0x5F9D3C</code>.
</p>

<br>

<h4>Exploiting OOB call</h4>
<p>
	This primitive is not quite ideal, as none of our overflow bugs allow us to control the memory where the jump targets are read from. Worse still, most of this memory region is mapped from a read-only section of the DVD Player, so it's unlikely that we can influence the contents of this memory region without another bug.
</p>

<p>
	After the function pointers, we do some see some addresses for <code>switch</code> <code>case</code> labels, which is slightly interesting because that allows us to jump into the middle of a function and execute its epilogue without having executed its prologue, allowing us to misalign the stack pointer and return to an unexpected value on the stack. I went through all of these and unfortunately I was only ever able to use that to jump to <code>0</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Finally after the code pointers, we see read only string data. Interestingly, this data can be changed by switching languages in the PS2 menu, which gives greater hope for finding at least 1 usable jump target in every firmware version, however it unfortunately comes at the cost of forcing the user to reconfigure their language.
</p>

<p>
	I decided to …</p></div></div></div>

</p>



    
<p>Cache-oblivious algorithms seemed incredible to me when I first heard about it in 6.854 (Advanced Algorithms). It’s relatively straightforward to imagine algorithms that utilizes information about page size $B$ and cache size $M$ to create efficient data structures. However, cache-oblivious algorithms are algorithms that achieve similar efficiencies <em>without knowing $B$ or $M$</em>. That means the same cache-oblivious algorithm can be ran on computers with different cache or page sizes and still achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as one that is tailored to that specific cache. The key to many of these algorithms is a recursive, fractal-like idea. I’ll describe a cache-oblivious algorithm for searching in a list of integers.</p>

<p>Here’s the set up. (TLDR at bottom) A program executes on the processor, but the input data resides on the disk. We can think of a disk as a really long linear array of data, but accessing it is really expensive. So, we instead invent this notion of a cache - a layer of memory of $M$ bits that is much smaller, but a lot faster to read/write to. For performance reasons, we will divide the disk and cache into blocks of $B$ bits, called pages, and we will transfer data between cache and disk a page at a time.</p>
<p>This cache sits between the processor and the disk, and the processor will never directly read or write to the disk. When the processor wants to read a piece of data that is not on the cache (this is called a cache miss), it will trigger some mechanism that copies the relevant page from the disk to the cache first, <em>evicting another page if the cache is full</em>, and then read from the cache.</p>
<p>How might this help? Well, trivially, if the entire set of data that the program needs fits in the cache, conceivably the processor could have fetched it all in the cache, paid the one-off cost, and then for the rest of the program the processor will never have to pay the expensive cost of reading from disk. Of course most programs require more data than that, and so we want to design algorithms that minimize cache misses.</p>
<h2 id="cache-management">Cache management</h2>
<p>However, the way computers are set up restricts the tools we have to achieve this. Programs executing on the processor have no explicit control over the cache. Instead, conceptually, programs continue to send read and write requests to the disk as though there is no cache. The processor intercepts these requests, and performs the necessary cache operations to serve the information. In other words, the cache is transparent to programs.  Thus, the task of reducing cache misses decomposes into two orthogonal components: writing efficient algorithms by cleverly ordering or specifying memory accesses, and efficient cache management.</p>
<p>For example, an efficient algorithm might try to shuffle memory accesses around so that memory accesses to a particular memory address are clumped together, increasing the likelihood that there will be a cache hit. In fact, because of the paging system, it would doubly help if memory accesses to the same <em>spatial region</em> are clumped together, because there’s a chance they’ll be on the same page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, efficient cache management entails trying to predict which piece of data to evict from the cache when there is a cache miss and we want to load more data into an already full cache. Since we’re focusing on the algorithm this article, we assume that the cache manager has magic oracle powers that lets it discard <em>optimally</em>, so from the algorithm design standpoint, if there exists a sequence of cache loads/writes that achieves our desired performance, we assume that the cache manager will do it. It turns out that this is not unreasonable, because simple techniques such as the Least Recently Used algorithm work <em>really</em> well. (An exposition on this deserves its own article.)</p>
<p>To summarize, the components of the external memory model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disk, effectively unbounded in size, stores data in pages of size $B$</li>
<li>Cache, stores $M/B$ pages, each page has size $B$</li>
<li>Processor executes algorithm, also manages cache.</li>
<li>Algorithm runs on the processor. When data is needed, the processor transparently loads the required page into the cache if there’s a cache miss, or serve the cached data if there isn’t</li>
</ul>
<p>There are efficient algorithms that require explicit knowledge of $B$ and $M$, and there cache-oblivous algorithms that are just as efficient, but some how do not. That is to say, the algorithm performs the same actions and requests the same sequence of memory accesses, that works efficiently no matter what size $B$ and $M$ really are. We’ll take a close look at the latter here.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to scan through a list of $N$ integers, to do some task, say finding the maximum. If the list occupy a contiguous block of memory on the disk, this can be done efficiently by loading pages one at a time, and scanning through the page before loading the next page. This thus takes $O(N/B)$ disk accesses, and is quite clearly optimal.</p>
<p>Suppose the algorithm does not know $B$. It can achieve the same efficiency by simply reading the elements of the list in order. The CPU will then fetch the first page to the cache, containing elements $0$ to $B-1$ and pass it to the program, and then when the program requires element $B$, it’ll read in the next page, which contains elements $B$ to $2B-1$, possibly overwriting the earlier page. This will just continue until all $N/B$ pages are read. This is cache-oblivious, because the algorithm of sequentially reading the elements is the same regardless of what $B$ is.</p>
<p>Note that in this example, it is essential that the list is stored in a contiguous block of memory. Had the elements been scattered around like in a linked-list, each access could potentially trigger a cache miss, since there’s no guarantee that neighboring elements will be on the same page. This may seem obvious, but this is the main mechanism by which we can write efficient algorithms - coming up with efficient layouts of data.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the problem of searching for an integer in a list. We’ll examine three ways of doing this.</p>
<h2 id="inefficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-binary-search">Inefficient cache-oblivious algorithm: Binary search</h2>
<p>Let’s assume the data is sorted in a list, and packed contiguously on the disk. A possible algorithm is then to perform binary search, which typically takes $O(\log N)$ reads. The binary search can be viewed a successively narrowing an interval in which the query value may reside in. However, once the interval that the binary search is narrowing is $O(B)$, the entire interval may reside in a page, and no further page accesses are required. Thus, we require only $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. Notice that this is a cache-oblivious algorithm because the algorithm doesn’t know what $B$ is - to the algorithm, it’s just running a standard binary search.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-but-not-cache-oblivious-b-trees">Efficient, but not cache-oblivious: B-trees</h2>
<p>Suppose we know $B$ ahead of time. We can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses. We arrange the list in the format of a B-tree, a generalized BST. Similar to a BST, each subtree of a B-tree corresponds to a contiguous subset of the elements of the list when sorted by value. However, each node $V$ of the tree contains not one, but $B$ elements, which splits the interval corresponding to the subtree rooted at node $V$ into not 2, but $B+1$ intervals. Then, we can traverse down the BST, and each time we go down one level we reduce the interval by a factor of $B$. This thus requires only $O(\log_B N) = O(\log N / \log B)$ page accesses. In reality of course, we have to store pointers and possibly other metadata in each node, so we can’t have exactly $B$ elements in each node, but we can definitely split by $\Theta(B)$ each level.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-van-emde-boas-layout">Efficient cache-oblivious algorithm: van Emde Boas layout</h2>
<p>Now we come to the exciting part. We claim that we can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses, but without having to know $B$ ahead of time. The data structure we’re using is a good old balanced Binary Search Tree. However, the order in which we store the nodes in memory matters. If we pack the the BST in a regular fashion, say in breadth-first order, we could potentially have a situation where almost every vertex in a BST search path, except for the first few, lies in a different page, and thus we’ll have to use $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. The van Embde Boas layout is basically a clever way of ordering the vertices of a binary search tree in a recursive, fractal-like manner such that each page access will fetch the next few vertices that will be queried, so that the next few accesses will be contained within that page.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For convenience, suppose the binary tree is complete and has height $H=2^K$. The layout is a permutation of the vertices of the binary tree. Denote $T(x, k)$ as the subtree of height $2^k$, rooted at vertex $x$. If the subtree at $x$ is deeper than $2^k$, then $T(x,k)$ will be the subtree truncated to the required depth. Denote $L(x, k)$ as the layout for that subtree. Then, for some root vertex $x$, of a (sub-)tree with height $h=2^k$, $L(x, k)$ is defined recursively as:</p>
<p>$$L(x, k) = L(x, k-1) \circ L(l_1, k-1) \circ L(l_2, k-1) \circ \dots \circ L(l_{n}, k-1)$$</p>
<p>Where, $l_1, \dots, l_{n}$ are the $n=2^{h/2}$ children of the leaves of $T(x, k-1)$, and $\circ$ is just concatenation. One application of this recursion is shown above.</p>
<h3 id="visual-sketch">Visual sketch</h3>
<p>If you didn’t catch that, don’t worry about it. Here’s a walkthrough. Suppose we’re given a complete binary tree of height $h=2^k$, rooted at $x$. We want to compute $L(x, k)$, which is a permutation of the vertices in this binary tree. Here’s how it’s done:</p>

<li>Cut all the edges between the $2^{k-1}$-th and $2^{k-1}+1$-th layer. This gives us:

<li>$2^{h/2}$ smaller BSTs with height $2^{k-1}$. These are the children subtrees now disconnected from the main subtree, …</li></ul></li></ol></article></div>

You’re wondering what web development interview questions the interviewer is going to fire off at you. Your mind is playing on your nerves. Tension rising notch by notch. “Am I really ready for that coding interview?” — you start beating yourself up.</p><p id="dd5e">You check your phone — it’s 3:05 pm. No missed calls. Nothing.</p><p id="f93c">You anxiously recheck your phone — 3:15 pm… still nothing.</p><p id="4c5c">You are already 30 minutes under pressure, sweating and silently moaning — your heart races. The latent impostor syndrome arises from the depths. You start freaking out… wondering whether or not you’ve given the wrong phone number… or if they might have forgotten about you.</p><p id="5e62">Your mind is leading a furious battle to overcome your anxious trains of thought. You, filled with a desperate hope, grab your phone with your sweaty pawl and look at it for one last time… and then… it rings.</p><p id="845c">You pick up and say, “Hello,” trying to hide the trembling notes in your voice, the anxious quiver of your lips and fingers, while battling the excruciating jittery inside your mind. You introduce each other and then… kinds of interview questions for web developers thrown at you, catching you off guard, that you can barely give an adequate answer to.</p><p id="d227">You realize that you are completely f*cked up. The overwhelming anxiety is growing deeper and deeper in you. You feel like you have a 200-kg bench press on your chest that you can’t lift. Vertigo comes along, and you suddenly forget. You forget your location, the person you are talking to… everything. Hands so sweaty that you just can’t hold your phone without it slipping through your fingers.</p><p id="a240">You know that the chances of making a good impression are so damn low that you’d have more luck if you were to bet on racing cockroaches.</p><p id="262a">To avoid that, you need strong preparation for the next coding interview. You need to have a grasp of the interview questions for web developers you are being asked. That will boost your confidence and diminish the anxiety before the phone or onsite interview.</p><p id="ab34">In this article, I’ll talk about the principles behind the developer interview process — the most common web developer questions you can expect from interviewers and how to answer them in a fascinating way that will put a WOW expression on their faces (even if they want to rip your head off, rearrange your face, or just clean their shoes ;-) ).</p><p id="a90c">To start off, you need to realize that the web dev interviewing process is more like a negotiation. You’ve been probably taught as a kid that you need to be flawless during interviews and answer every question accurately to make a good impression and get hired.</p><p id="b625">This couldn’t be further from the truth (coming from someone who got hired by sending out a cold message directly to their employer — no official nor traditional interview process).</p><p id="e763">Yes, of course, you need to make a good impression. But if you think that making a good impression comes down to awkwardly staring at your interviewer, frozen, while answering every developer interview question like a robot… you’re highly mistaken my friend.</p><p id="804e">You need to be able to communicate with your future employer freely while at the same time exuding confidence, knowledge, curiosity, and most importantly, enthusiasm.</p><p id="e9be">Here are the main things employers look for when hiring people:</p><ol><li id="c9d8"><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Have-a-Great-Personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personality</a>.</li><li id="bc1a"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/whats-the-difference-between-a-programmer-coder-developer-and-engineer-bd315404de7">Basic qualifications</a>.</li><li id="5b8b"><a href="http://breathehr.com/blog/what-is-cultural-fit-and-why-is-it-important" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture fit</a>.</li><li id="e3a7"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/how-to-become-a-10x-engineer-492fa3f57101">Enthusiasm</a>.</li></ol><p id="c68d">You need to have a fitting personality, meaning, you need to be able to easily communicate with your team without any hassle whatsoever. You need to ask clear and concise questions while at the same time, giving thorough and detailed answers.</p><p id="51b8">Of course, you also need to possess basic qualifications for the job you are applying for. Yet, many people seem to put tons of attention to that one (which is perfectly fine), but it’s just ¼ of the whole equation.</p><p id="61d9">Culture fit — this ties back into your personality. You have to be able to sync with your team and develop a culture that everyone enjoys working in.</p><p id="147b">And finally, have a burning passion and enthusiasm for your job. You’ll be surprised how helpful enthusiasm can be.</p><p id="eee3">For example, you may not have as good a resume as the guy in the next room that’s also being interviewed… but if you display a burning enthusiasm and willingness to go out of your way, you can beat other candidates and win the job. Of course, that may not always be the case. Still, it’s much more likely for an employer to hire you as a hyper enthusiastic person than as an average employee.</p><p id="2cb1">Alright, let’s take a look at some of the most common web developer interview questions (and answers) you may encounter. We’ll first start with professional software engineer behavioral questions and then switch over to more technical questions.</p><p id="6540">Whether you are a front-end, back-end, or full-stack software developer, these common computer science interview questions will help you in your preparation for the next coding interview.</p><p id="0f2d">NOTE: Some of the behavioral questions can also be noticed in web design interviews. So if you are a web designer, this article will highly prepare you for the next web design interview.</p><p id="53af">Most interviewers start off with introductory questions. Just follow the common sense when answering these software engineer interview questions. Try to be as transparent as possible. Tell them what really sparked your interest in coding and why you applied for this job.</p><p id="9720">If you are applying for an entry-level web developer job, interviewers won’t expect years of experience (they may even skip that question) as you’ve probably just graduated or finished a coding boot camp. Yet, if you are applying for a senior software engineer position, you need to have years of experience to back up your application for that web development job.</p><p id="ed12">You need to get familiar with Agile frameworks such as Kanban and Scrum because nowadays companies are adopting Agile practices and moving away from Waterfall methodologies. Interviewers may also ask you questions about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/software-development-life-cycle-the-ultimate-guide-2020-153d17bb20fb">SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) process</a>.</p><p id="3aa1">As simple as that. You might want to focus on the specific languages that your web development job will require you to use most frequently.</p><p id="b2b4">Lately, having experience with multiple languages like C++, Java, and Python will definitely widen your interviewer’s eyes in astonishment.</p><p id="588b"><em>Credits to Andrew Mallonee, CEO at </em><a href="https://malloneemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Mallonee Media</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="0286">Be transparent and give a thorough explanation.. Sometimes, the interviewer might follow up with, “Do you get excited by using these languages?” but rarely. Obviously, reply with Yes and explain why you feel excited.</p><p id="fb59">It’s more of a soft skill interview question. Software engineering is a job in which you need to always thrive and sharpen your skills. Employers need to know that their developers are on the cutting edge using the latest technologies and constantly honing their skills. So, the answer to that software developer interview question would obviously be “Yes” — but expand further by telling them what interests you the most when it comes to learning new coding skills.</p><p id="14d6">Talk about projects similar to the projects you are going to be working on in the position you are applying for. If not, be genuine (always) and tell them what really sparks your passion for software development.</p><p id="e2fd">Here, interviewers particularly want to hear about severe problems, not many people on your team were able to solve, yet you were. Something important to remember is not to try to impress the interviewer — the scales will fall from his eyes immediately. Instead of making a good impression, you’ll make a desperate one. Be casual when talking about the problem that no one was able to solve except you. You, thus, exude confidence and knowledge. Being humble in the answer of this web dev interview question is key.</p><p id="6399">Another soft skill interview question. Life is about learning from your mistakes. Be as transparent as possible and openly admit the mistakes you’ve made in the past. Talk about the lessons you’ve learned. Basically, explain how you coped with your worst failures and came out stronger.</p><p id="bf9b">Research a lot prior to the interview. Go through all of their social media profiles to find little nuggets of information that would impress your interviewer. Show passion and enthusiasm for the company. Enthusiasm plays a huge role in the interview process.</p><p id="7b49">Same as previous — conduct thorough research and analysis before the interview. Show passion and enthusiasm. Tell the interviewer why you would love to work on those particular projects. They can thus see the reason behind that enthusiasm and wind out the thoughts of all that being a mere fluff.</p><p id="b2c0">These web development interview questions can happen over the phone or onsite.</p><p id="e12a">The following technical interview questions typically happen onsite, but sometimes they can take place remotely. If it’s remotely, the interviewer will ask you to share your screen to watch over your shoulder while you are coding and at the same time answering software development interview questions.</p><p id="c6ea">Keep in mind that the technical questions you are being asked highly depend on the position you are applying for. We’ll try to cover some of the most common software developer interview questions and give you reasonable answers that you can adjust to your situation easily.</p><p id="699b"><em>Credits to Michael Miller, CEO at </em><a href="https://vpnonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>VPN Online</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="fc04">There are lots of ways you can write your code, and all of them are correct. The company you want to join probably has a set standard for writing code and will perhaps compare your answer to that standard. Usually, most companies look for developers who take the simplest approach to code and try to weep out those who praise the sophisticated way of coding. That’s because companies want to easily maintain and document their code.</p><p id="3b99">Java developer interview questions are quite common. When interviewers ask you …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

        <article>
                        
<p>The aim of this project was to display a colour image on a black and white monitor, by overlaying an acetate bayer filter over the monitor and mosaicing a colour image.</p>



<p>I obtained an Eizo B&amp;W monitor from ebay, which I was intending for use viewing B&amp;W photos and was curious if I could replicate an effect similar to <strong>Autochrome Lumière</strong> ( see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochrome_Lumi%C3%A8re">wikipedia</a> ) where they overlay colour filters over a B&amp;W photographic plate, using starch grains, which creates a colour image.</p>



<p>The following image shows a 500x microscope image of the pixels that make up the B&amp;W LCD display, taken using a very cheap USB microscope.  It looks to me as if each pixel, is represented by 4 sub-pixel elements, please correct me if this appears not be the case.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>A pdf was created of the bayer display, with the dimensions 433.1mm x 324.8mm.  The monitor has a resolution of 2048×1536 and I assumed the pixels had the same width as height.</p>



<p>You can see an example of the pdf I created below, where for example a blue element, should be represented by 2×2 pixels from the B&amp;W monitor. </p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-1024x540.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-1024x540.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-300x158.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-768x405.png 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf-1536x810.png 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bayer_pdf.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I created 3 pdfs:</p>



<ul><li>bayer_1.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 1 pixel from the display</li><li>bayer_2.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 2×2 pixels from the display (this is the acetate used in the video)</li><li>bayer_4.pdf – each element is represented by 4×4 pixels from the display</li></ul>



<p>The following image shows the printed acetate with the bayer pattern:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-1024x683.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_7509-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The following, is a B&amp;W image with mosaicing applied from the colour image:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-1024x768.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-300x225.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-768x576.png 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/out.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<h2>How it works</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-1024x616.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-1024x616.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-300x180.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-768x462.png 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-1536x923.png 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1.png 1898w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The monitor I am using seems to generally be used portrait, to make it landscape on linux:</p>


<pre title="">xrandr --output HDMI1 --rotate left
</pre>


<h2>Image of effect</h2>



<p>As you can see the effect of my attempt is quite slight, but you can see in the centre the different colours of the balloons.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001.jpg"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<h2>Video of effect</h2>



<p>The effect is also demonstrated in the following video, with the following parameters:</p>


<pre title=""> mpv out.mkv --fullscreen --loop --brightness=10 --contrast=20
</pre>


<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rainbow - using an acetate bayer filter over a B&amp;W monitor" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sh2d9qAjYPo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2>Microscope images of the bayer filter (2×2 scaling)</h2>



<p>2×2 bayer filter, I tried to design it so that for example the ‘red’ square covers 2×2 pixels on the monitor</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<h2>Chess board </h2>



<p>As suggested by Olivier, I’ve just created 2 chess board images.  Olivier was correct that a single pixel consists of 3 sub-pixels 🙂</p>



<p>1×1 (the white patch is 1 pixel), monitor in landscape, image in correct orientation from microscope (left, towards left monitor, top, towards top of monitor)</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0020.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0020.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0020-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>2×2 </p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0002.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0002.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0002-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<h2>Possible improvements</h2>



<p>I wonder if by measuring the exact pixel width/height under a microscope, if the effect could possibly be improved somewhat, as that information could be used when creating the acetate filter.</p>



<p>Alignment is also a key issue, I need to think of ways to improve that possibly using a microscope while aligning the acetate.</p>



<p>I’d be interested in other improvements I could make too!</p>

                <p>Last year as I kicked off my career entering the professional tech world, I came across the concept of <strong>Objective, Key and Results (OKRs)</strong> at work. I was quite intrigued by the whole concept of OKRs.</p>

<p>In very layman terms —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Main objective of OKR is to plan out qualitative goals with quantitative results for those with proper time tracking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People do use diary or todo apps for tracking there work. Todo apps usually work for tracking tasks over a shorter duration. You need a framework to plan out for your bigger goal and track your progress towards it.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*bX5Vy1OPJ3LImq9DHIgU5g.png" alt="Personal OKR Header Section"></p>

<p>In this blog, I will try to explain how you can plan and why it is important to have your Personal OKR. Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<p>OKRs is already a very popular term in business, most probably it is being used at your workplace too. It is a <strong>goal-setting framework</strong> that basically covers big and challenging goals with a set of defined measurable results for achieving these goals.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective — </h3>

<ul>
  <li>What do you want to achieve over a period of time?</li>
  <li>Objectives should be ambitious, more <strong>inspirational</strong> (which requires more effort of yours), bold and <strong>qualitative</strong></li>
  <li>Your targets should not be something very easily achievable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Improve the financial condition, Get better at reading, etc</p>

<h3 id="key-results">Key Results</h3>

<ul>
  <li>KRs are steps you need to achieve the objective.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Quantitative</strong> i.e having defined metrics! This should not be vague. Add numbers, avoid terms like “more/less”.<br>
Google uses. a scale of 0–1 for tracking progress for each key result.</li>
  <li>Make KRs <strong>Time-bounded</strong>. This helps you tracking progress over the period and lets you recalibrate your tasks.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Binary</strong> i.e Complete / Incomplete</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Read 3 books on investing, Read 1500 pages monthly, etc</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="personal-vs-work-okrs">Personal vs Work OKRs?</h3>

<p>OKRs are used by both teams and individuals, though mostly in work environments. The concept of OKR is simple and works pretty effectively for personal use as well. It is super important to have separate personal and work OKRs since your work goals are different from personal life and goals.</p>

<p>In personal OKRs, you would want to track things like —</p>

<ol>
  <li>Family time</li>
  <li>Personal finance</li>
  <li>Fitness</li>
  <li>Hobbies</li>
</ol>

<p>Personal OKRs are <strong>literally personal</strong>!<br>
It varies from person to person. It’s good to look for ideas on how people use OKRs, but you should align it for your goals and aspirations which you want to achieve.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actions — and data — speak louder than words.”<br>
― <strong>John Doerr,</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/54960827"><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>OKRs help you plan your goals in a structured and planned fashion, but there is more to it! Let me explain —</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better <strong>Focus</strong> and <strong>Alignment</strong> on what you want to achieve. Since OKRs are limited, you don’t want to waste time and do stuff that doesn’t really help you achieve what you want!</li>
  <li>These give the <strong>Motivation</strong> to work towards your objectives and a sense of urgency to finish them.</li>
  <li>OKRs help in building a <strong>Habit</strong> of planning things in general and following the path to achieving them. Eg. You have an objective of getting better at reading, you start reading 30 pages daily. Now, it slowly builds into your habit to read. Next year, even if you don’t have this objective, you’ll still read :)</li>
  <li><strong>Time Tracking</strong> is super useful and important since they give a timeline for you to work and align your tasks accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics</strong> and Numbers help you visualize your progress. When you see 80% completion, you get a psychological motivation to make it 100%</li>
  <li>If you have a <strong>Public OKR</strong>, you get another source to actually work and complete your task.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>Now, that you understand the importance of Personal OKRs and are ready to create yours, I’ll show how I personally maintain my OKRs and share resources that might be useful for you!</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>There are a lot of tools that you can use to start creating an OKR. I personally being a big fan of <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, use it to maintain my Personal OKRs. You can use anything from professional notes and trackers like <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to simple excel sheet template.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*IOarq_FgPMWWVqohXAMvHg.png" alt="OKR Tracking with Notes"></p>

<p>I usually update my OKRs monthly since I maintain a yearly OKR tracker. You can adjust it according to the timeline you are planning for.</p>

<p>I maintain different tables for each of my Objectives. In the image below</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> — Boost Knowledge</p>

<p><strong>Key Results</strong> —</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Read 20 books</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create 2 open source projects</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Time Tracking</strong> — <br>
I maintain time tracking based on which quarter of the year I want this to be completed. I do break these KRs into sub-tasks which are added to my Todolist with a specified timeline.<br>
I use <strong>EOY</strong> (End of Year) in cases when I want that KR to be worked on throughout the year.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>—</p>

<p>I set my KRs progress to one of the 5 stages. It helps me keep track of what to do next and what is already completed. I sometimes add <strong>At-Risk</strong> tag to denote that this KR is probably not happening. I already added <strong>At-Risk</strong> to my traveling KRs this year credits to corona :(</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HQJ56kvlk0-mDZiXBrptfw.png" alt="Quarter based timeframe and Status for tracking progress"></p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>  — <br>
These are basically notes/links relevant to KR which I would want to revisit when I come back to this sometime later.</p>

<h2 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid changing OKRs</strong>! It is okay to update OKRs when you achieve something or want to divert. Do not remove OKRs just because you are doing something else now, at the end of the timeframe you should know that you failed at this due to XYZ reason, and was it worth it or not?</li>
  <li>You will fail in many Key results! <strong>It is okay to fail</strong>, now you get an idea on what did you miss, how can you improve and rework accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly update your KRs status and notes</strong>, this gives you an idea of where you need to focus more in the next few days. A biweekly or monthly review is generally a good time to revisit OKRs. I set up a biweekly reminder in my calendar for this!</li>
  <li>You can <strong>add a score</strong> to each KR to make things more interesting. For the first time, I wanted to keep it simple. Do share if you use some interesting scoring :P</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid setting too many OKRs</strong> instead make the OKRs more challenging.</li>
  <li>Add links to your weekly tasks in notes sections. This helps you view how did you spend your week in the perspective of achieving your OKR results. Even add resources for specific KRs. This helps you increase your knowledge base over a period of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep it simple</strong>! Follow what you can maintain. Don’t overcomplicate :)</li>

    <p>Font rasterisation is, in the author’s opinion, one of the most
    interesting fields of computer science. If music is the subjective
    application of physics, then font rasterisation is almost
    certainly the subjective application of computer science. The
    purpose of this article is threefold: firstly, to provide an
    introduction into the various methods available to aid in the
    rasterisation process; secondly, to provide a critical analysis of
    these methods against the needs of desktop applications; and
    finally, to relate this analysis to free software.</p>
    <p>Figures, in the form of bitmap images, are used extensively
    throughout. This is done to ensure consistent results across

    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>Before we start exploring the various methods used in font
    rasterisation, it is important to first understand <em>why</em>
    rasterisation is so difficult. Why should rasterisation on a
    computer screen be any more complicated than on a printer? It all
    comes down to resolution. Or, more precisely, the number
    of <em>dots per inch</em> (DPI).</p>
    <p>Printers typically start at around 300 DPI, with 600 DPI not
    being uncommon. This means that for every inch (2.54cm), there are
    potentially 300+ individual dots. Fonts, however, are not measured
    in dots but instead in <em>points</em>: 1/72 of an inch. A direct
    consequence of this is that a specific font at 10pt will have the
    same <em>physical dimensions</em> irrespective of the DPI at which
    it is rasterised.</p>
    <p>Whereas printers have a relatively high DPI, computer screens
    are typically <em>assumed</em> to be at 96 DPI, over three times
    lower. Herein lies the difficulty with on-screen
    rasterisation. This is best illustrated with an example: Figure 1
    shows the letter ‘M’ in 10pt Times New Roman at 600, 300, and 96
    DPI, respectively. Looking at the figure, it is clear that 96 DPI
    is not sufficient to preserve the shape—or letter-form—of the
    glyph.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="137" height="55" alt="M at a low DPI" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/m-various-dpi.png"></p><p>Figure 1: How 10pt Times Roman looks at 600, 300, and 96
      DPI.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This phenomenon can be explained using <em>information
    theory</em>. Since glyphs contain information it is possible to
    view them as a signal comprised of various frequencies. The
    Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem states that in order to
    accurately reproduce a signal, the sampling rate needs to
    be <em>at least twice the maximum frequency of the
    signal</em>. Should the sampling rate be lower than this, then
    distortions—in the form of aliasing—will be introduced. In the
    case of rasterisation, the sampling rate corresponds directly to
    the DPI of the output device.</p>
    <p>An example of aliasing as a consequence of low DPI can be seen
    in Figure 2.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="249" height="12" alt="Aliasing at a low DPI" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 2: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI. Note how some stems
      are thicker than others, and how certain features are
      under-/over-emphasised.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Since it is clear that 96 DPI is insufficient for accurate
    rasterisation, we are left with two options. The first is to find
    a way of <em>increasing the effective sampling rate</em> of the
    device, while the second is to <em>reduce the frequency of the
    glyphs to allow the use of a lower sampling rate</em>. All of the
    methods presented in this article fall into one of these two
    categories.</p>
    <h2><a name="font-hinting">Font Hinting</a></h2>
    <p>One of the oldest and mostly widely used techniques for
    improving rasterisation quality is font hinting. Also known
    as <em>grid fitting</em>, hinting involves modifying the shape of
    glyphs in order to ensure they line up with the rasterisation
    grid. By distorting the glyph so that it is aligned with the pixel
    grid, the overall frequency is reduced. An example of font hinting
    can be seen in Figure 3.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="257" height="26" alt="Un-hinted vs hinted text" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/hinting.png"></p><p>Figure 3: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI with (bottom) and
      without (top) hinting. Also note the differing widths between
      the hinted and un-hinted text.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The hinted text is much more consistent than its un-hinted
    counterpart. However, this consistency comes at the price of
    accuracy. An unavoidable consequence of warping glyphs to the
    rasterisation grid is that their dimensions change slightly. These
    small differences quickly add up over a line of text resulting in
    a visible difference—such as that seen in Figure 3. The author
    refers to this phenomenon as <em>character drift</em>.</p>
    <p>The degree of hinting required to produce consistent output is
    dependent on the DPI of the output device; low resolution devices
    require more aggressive hinting than high resolution device. One
    of the consequences of aggressive hinting—necessary as it may
    be—is character drift. At resolutions in excess of 300 DPI, it is
    possible to forego font hinting entirely.</p>
    <h3>Implementation details</h3>
    <p>Font hinting is usually achieved through one of two
    approaches. The first of these puts the font designer in control
    of the hinting process. This is the approach taken by the TrueType
    font specification—without a doubt the most widespread font
    format. In the specification, a virtual machine is used to
    instruct the rasteriser on how to go about rendering a
    glyph. This, in theory, gives designers <em>pixel level</em>
    control over how glyphs are rasterised at various
    sizes <cite><a href="#tur01a">Tur01a</a></cite>. The second
    approach is to leave hinting up to the font rasteriser—so
    called <em>auto-hinting</em>. When rendering non-TrueType
    fonts—such as those in Adobe’s Type 1 format, or those that lack
    hinting instructions—this is often the only
    option <cite><a href="#tur01a">Tur01a</a></cite>.</p>
    <p>In order for a meaningful comparison to be made between these
    approaches, it is first necessary to have an understanding of some
    of the other techniques available for improving rasterisation
    quality.</p>
    <h2><a name="anti-aliasing">Anti-aliasing</a></h2>
    <p>So far, we have been assuming that pixels are bi-level, either
    on or off, black or white. However, modern computer screens are
    capable of displaying millions of colours, including shades of
    grey. Font rasterisers are able to take advantage of this by using
    a technique called <em>anti-aliasing</em>. As the name would
    suggest, anti-aliasing is a means of avoiding the unwanted effects
    of aliasing when sampling a high-frequency signal on a
    low-frequency device. This is done by blurring the signal; its
    effect is to reduce its maximal frequency.</p>
    <p>Pixels of anti-aliased text are multi-level. That is, they can
    be black, white, or a shade of grey. The shade of a pixel depends
    on the percentage of the pixel that is <em>masked</em> by the
    glyph. This concept is neatly demonstrated in Figure 4.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="92" height="63" alt="Primitive anti-aliasing" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/g-anti-aliased.png"></p><p>Figure 4: The letter ‘g’ in 10pt Times New Roman at 672 DPI
      (left) and 96 DPI (right). The right glyph has been rendered
      with a (primitive) anti-aliasing algorithm and scaled by a
      factor of 7.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The effect of anti-aliasing on a line of text can be seen in
    Figure 5. Anti-aliasing does a very good job at preserving the
    shapes of glyphs. Moreover, the anti-aliased text does not suffer
    from character drift. However, this accuracy comes at the
    sacrifice of clarity—the anti-aliased text has a much lower
    contrast than its hinted counterpart.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="257" height="41" alt="A comparison of anti-aliased
      text" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/anti-aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 5: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI; without
      anti-aliasing or hinting (top), with hinting (middle), with
      anti-aliasing (bottom).</p>
    </div>
    <h2><a name="anti-aliasing-with-hinting">Combining Anti-aliasing
    With Hinting</a></h2>
    <p>Both hinting and anti-aliasing improve the legibility of text
    at low resolutions by making it more consistent. Hinting does this
    at the cost of <em>accuracy</em>, while anti-aliasing does it at
    the cost of <em>contrast</em>. At this point, the logical question
    to ask is “can hinting and anti-aliasing be used in conjunction
    with each other?” The answer is yes—with the appropriate finesse,
    it is possible to hint anti-aliased text.</p>
    <p>In principle, hinting anti-aliased text is exactly the same as
    hinting monochromatic text. However, in practice, a different
    implementation is required in order to produce high-quality
    output <cite><a href="#tur01b">Tur01b</a></cite>. The practicality
    of this depends on the hinting approach taken; it is significantly
    easier when the hinting is performed by the font rasteriser
    instead of a virtual machine. Indeed, naïvely combining TrueType
    hinting with anti-aliasing can often result in a <em>reduction in
    overall consistency</em>! This is most readily observed when
    rendering sans-serif fonts, as can be seen in Figure 6.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="263" height="43" alt="Hinting and anti-aliasing
      combined" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/bytecode-hinting-with-anti-aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 6: 10pt Arial at 96 DPI; with TrueType hinting (top),
      with anti-aliasing (middle), with TrueType hinting and
      anti-aliasing (bottom).</p>
    </div>
    <p>While the output is legible, it lacks consistency—some
    characters, such as ‘w’ and ‘s’, are anti-aliased, while others,
    such as ‘l’, are not. This causes some characters to appear to be
    heavier than others. These heavier characters are often referred
    to as being <em>dirty</em>. The undesirable characteristics
    apparent in Figure 6 arise because the anti-aliased text is being
    hinted <em>as if it were regular monochromatic text</em>. (Which,
    incidentally, is why the application of anti-aliasing has no
    effect on the overall character drift.) But as was established in
    the previous section, anti-aliased text has a <em>lower
    frequency</em> than monochromatic text. The solution, therefore,
    is to use less aggressive hinting. This is quite difficult to
    accomplish when using TrueType hinting, as the virtual machine
    does not …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These are some of the common myths about Patents and Trademarks in startups.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have a startup idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>It’s natural to feel defensive about our <a href="https://hitstartup.com/startup-ideas-vs-problems/" target="_blank">startup idea</a>, but patents are for invention/innovation and not for a startup idea; even if we get nightmares about <a href="https://hitstartup.com/faang-will-steal-my-idea/" target="_blank">FAANG stealing our startup idea</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-an-innovative-app-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have an innovative app idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>Most countries don’t allow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200213051434/https://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/software_patents_fulltext.html" target="_blank">patent for a software</a>. Economic theories, methods of doing business, mathematical methods or computer programs&nbsp;as such&nbsp;are not patentable inventions in several countries.</p><h3 id="my-patent-attorney-said-they-are-patentable">My patent attorney said they are patentable</h3><p>Did you read all the clauses in the agreement you signed with your patent attorney? The decision to award a patent to an invention/innovation lies solely with the patent examiner of the country. By the time a patent application is filed, till it comes to examination, several years and thousands of dollars would have been spent.</p><p>Although ethically, a patent attorney should explicitly convey their doubts on patentability of an invention, few rarely do. Even when Prior Art Search(Searching for conflicting patents) is conducted by the patent attorney, they are not always successful in bringing up the conflicting patents because our patent application is not drafted yet.</p><p>But, when the Govt. patent examiner does the Prior Art Search while examining our patent application, they will likely find conflicting patents if it exists.</p><h3 id="i-have-paid-my-patent-attorney-explained-my-invention-now-all-i-have-to-do-is-just-sit-tight-for-a-patent">I have paid my patent attorney, explained my invention, now all I have to do is just sit tight for a patent</h3><p>An average patent attorney drafts patent for anything from innovation in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet" target="_blank">bidet</a> to quantum computers, so they are experts in using language to define an invention but they are rarely an expert in any field of invention.</p><p>So, this requires utmost care from the inventor to work along with the patent drafter to articulate their invention with appropriate vocabulary.</p><p>Unfortunately, patent attorneys tend to force the inventor to not to be specific in describing their invention in the patent application in order to exploit the loop holes in patent examination; This may help in getting the patent, but it also enables someone else to exploit the same loop holes to file a patent for the copy of our invention by just changing the grammar/vocabulary because our patent was too generic.</p><h3 id="i-have-filed-for-a-patent-no-one-would-copy-my-innovation-invention">I have filed for a patent, no one would copy my innovation/invention</h3><p>Examination of patent takes several years, although in the meantime we could use ‘patent-pending’ tag if our patent application gets published, finding someone who is copying our invention takes proactive approach. If the copied invention is being applied for patent, we need to detect it from published journal of the patent office and raise a concern.</p><p>All these takes extraordinarily focused effort and budget.</p><h3 id="i-have-applied-for-a-patent-via-pct-i-will-receive-patent-for-all-countries">I have applied for a patent via PCT, I will receive patent for all countries</h3><p><a href="https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/" target="_blank">PCT - Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> simplifies the process of applying for a patent in several countries who are part of the PCT treaty, but the process of obtaining a patent depends upon the individual country’s patent laws.</p><p>Even during filing PCT, the second phase i.e. national phase involves filing documents for patent application in the respective individual countries requiring working with the patent attorney’s of those countries resulting in thousands of dollars of expense for each country we wish to apply for via PCT.</p><p>We can extrapolate the same process for patent examination in each of those countries.</p><p>Then there are certain countries which even while being part of the PCT, doesn’t enforce patent protection for inventions of other countries in order to protect their local businesses which copies our invention.</p><h3 id="i-have-received-my-patent-it-would-prevent-someone-from-copying-my-invention">I have received my patent, it would prevent someone from copying my invention</h3><p>Like any law, existence of a law doesn’t prevent someone from violating it; enforcement and judicial process should uphold that law. Similarly, existence of patent doesn’t prevent someone from copying our invention.</p><p>We need to find the violator, pursue an often lengthy and expensive judicial process to claim our right to the invention protected by the patent.</p><h3 id="i-m-the-inventor-in-the-patent-i-can-do-anything-with-it">I’m the inventor in the patent, I can do anything with it</h3><p>Unless the inventor in the patent is the owner of the patent, the inventor has no right to the patent. This is often the case when businesses file patents, where the business is the owner in the patent and the employee is the inventor in the patent.</p><h3 id="patents-are-only-for-protecting-my-invention">Patents are only for protecting my invention</h3><p>The main reason to protect the invention is to reap the value of the invention if needed. Patents offer commercial and strategic value to businesses.</p><p>So, patents are often used for trading them for money or for other patents in organizations apart from using it for protecting their inventions.</p><h3 id="patents-make-me-look-cool">Patents make me look cool</h3><p>Not necessarily, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/new-low-bad-patent-patent-troll-sues-ventilator-company" target="_blank">patent trolls</a> have left a bad taste in the inventor/innovator community; so much so that many are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIihrcqJYA" target="_blank">choosing not to file patent for their invention</a>.</p><p>Expenses, effort, lengthy unfair judicial trials has made several startups to not pursue patent for their invention in favor of capital efficiency.</p><h3 id="open-source-projects-doesn-t-need-patents">Open-source projects doesn’t need patents</h3><p>Open-source projects might need patents to <a href="https://golang.org/PATENTS" target="_blank">protect itself from getting sued for patent infringement</a>.

  <p><time datetime="2020-06-09T09:45:00-0400">Tue, Jun 9, 2020</time></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/posts/hp712-nextstep-part-1">last post of this series</a>, I set up NeXTstep on an HP PA-RISC <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/pizzaboxes/hp712">workstation</a>. Today, I’m going to get down to business: configure networking, install system patches, outfit it with developer tools, and install some useful software!</p>
<p>As with the previous post, I’ve also made a YouTube video that covers roughly the same topics! If video is your speed, I’d love for you to check it out!</p>
<p>

</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My goal is to end up with a capable machine that I can use like it might have been when new, and learn from the experience.</p>
<h2 id="foreshadowing-networking-woes">Foreshadowing networking woes</h2>
<p>While it is possible to transfer files from SCSI drives (or even floppies!), <strong>getting a pizzabox on my home network makes loading software much easier</strong>.
I first tried out NeXTstep on this workstation a couple years ago. The OS installed OK, but I ran in to trouble with networking. I was initially optimistic that I would figure it out:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I'm done for the day but soon if I can fight with NFS and NetInfo (lolololol) I can get screenshots off it and software on</p>— cron mom (@sophaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/962427825608429568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2018</a></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>NARRATOR</strong>: she did not soon win the fight with NFS and NetInfo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hang on a second: NeXTstep is a workstation-focused Unix operating system from the 80s-90s - <strong>how could it be difficult to get it on a network</strong>? The answer is a thing called NetInfo.</p>
<p>In a surprise to exactly no one, NeXTstep, being from a company founded by Steve Jobs, had it’s own NeXT-only ecosystem of tools that fit together amazingly well. <strong>The cornerstone of NeXTstep networking was NetInfo</strong>. If you had a collection of NeXT computers on a network, NetInfo gave you a system to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage user accounts that would work across all machines</li>
<li>configure file sharing</li>
<li>control permissions around access to network resources</li>
<li>assign IP addresses and hostnames</li>
<li>quickly bring new machines in to the network</li>
<li>serve this information in a highly-available manner</li>
</ul>
<p>which is to say: NetInfo is a “directory services” system. That’s all well and good - in the early 1990s that space had many competitors and a “right path” hadn’t yet been established, but…<strong>I don’t <em>want</em> my machine to be part of a directory</strong>, **I just want it to be on my existing TCP/IP network.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-simple-network">Starting a “simple” network</h2>
<p>With that in mind, I (naively) attempted to use the “SimpleNetworkStarter” application.</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/simple-network-starter-1.png" alt="SimpleNetworkStarter">

      <figcaption>
          <p>SimpleNetworkStarter</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>The SimpleNetworkStarter window has three “steps”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>how we’ll integrate</strong> with an existing NetInfo network (since I don’t intend to interact with one at all, I have to choose “Provide the services specified below”, a sort of catch-all)</li>
<li>Specify <strong>my hostname and IP address</strong> - if I were connecting to an existing NetInfo network, I might not have to do this. “Network Options” lets me set more granular IP settings like netmask and gateway; “NetInfo Options” lets me choose how to integrate with existing domains (if relevant).</li>
<li>Setup <strong>network services</strong>: for my setup I don’t really want <em>any</em> of these things, but as a standalone NeXTstep system, I do have to “Maintain the master copy of network administrative data” (aka, the NetInfo database).</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, this feels like a really good start, but will it let me fetch files from an NFS share?</p>
<h2 id="networking-woes">Networking woes</h2>
<p>I immediately tried connecting to my NAS over NFS - after all, the main point of setting up networking was making it easier to transfer files. Unfortunately, it didn’t work - I could set up the NFS mount with NFSMananger (more on how to do that later), but the mountpoint would always be empty. Here you can see me attempting to reach it by IP address:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/failing-nfs-mount.png" alt="a failing NFS mount">

      <figcaption>

      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>So I had <em>some</em> sort of problem. To narrow down potential issues, I ran a few tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>attempting to ping my NAS</strong> from the workstation - this turned out to not work because NeXTstep doesn’t seem to have any <code>ping</code> command. There are probably ways to accomplish something equivalent with the tools it <em>does</em> have, but I just moved on</li>
<li><strong>attempting to ping the workstation</strong> from elsewhere on my network. This worked - I was able to ping it from my laptop!</li>
<li><strong>attempting to connect to my NAS with FTP</strong> - one of the few network tools NeXTstep <em>does</em> seem to have is FTP, so I gave it a shot. To my surprise, this works!</li>
</ul>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-ip.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)">

      <figcaption>
          <p>connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>It did not work via hostname, though, which points to at least some trouble with DNS. Taking a deeper look at the “NeXTstep 3.3 Network and
System Administration Manual” section on “<a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Docs/NeXTStep/3.3/nsa/11_MixedNet.htmld/index.html">NEXTSTEP Computers in a Mixed Network</a>” (which I probably should have done earlier) shows that <strong>I need to manually configure DNS</strong>. There’s no GUI options for it, you just have to write out an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/resolv-conf.png" alt="editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi">

      <figcaption>
          <p>editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>After rebooting, I was able to access the NAS via FTP by hostname:


</p><div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-hostname.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname">

      <figcaption>
          <p>connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>But still couldn’t use NFS. What gives? I have network connectivity in both directions, and DNS is also now working! I believe this is as far as I got a few years ago, and man I was FRUSTRATED.</p>
<p>Eventually I thought to look in the system log (<code>/usr/adm/messages</code>) for hints:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" alt="an error from autonfsmount">
    </p>
    <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption>
          <p>an error from autonfsmount</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>and there it was:</p>
<pre><code>autonfsmount: Can't get my address
</code></pre><p>Can’t get…<em>my</em> address? Doesn’t the computer know its own address? While I don’t know <em>why</em> it has to do this (googling has provided me a couple of <a href="https://rute.gerdesas.com/node31.html">quick asides</a> mentioning it, but not much detail), <strong>mounting an NFS server requires working <em>reverse</em> DNS for your IP</strong>.</p>
<p>I do have a real-ish DNS server for my home network, and it populates based on DHCP leases and IP reservations. This workstation, though, was just <strong>using an IP that I habitually hardcode for pizzaboxes (192.168.1.200)</strong>. I double-checked the DHCP server config, and it was indeed set up with a different host for that IP, and not set up at all for this hostname. I replaced that entry with one for <code>hp712</code> at <code>192.168.1.200</code> for the MAC address of my workstation, and crossed my fingers.</p>
<p>It worked! I could browse my NAS from the file-browser.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="setting-up-an-nfs-mount">Setting up an NFS mount</h2>
<p>After all that rigamarole, the right way to configure a remote NFS mount goes through the NFSManager.app. While NFSManager lets you configure both “exports” (local directories I share with others) and “imports” (remote directories I want to mount locally).</p>

</div>

<p>That’s it? A lot of struggle got me to this point, but <em>finally</em> I can transfer files.</p>
<h2 id="patch-tuesday">Patch Tuesday</h2>
<p>The first order of business is to <strong>run system updates</strong>. NeXTstep 3.3 was released in mid-1995, and it had three patch updates: the <a href="https://www.nextop.de/NeXTAnswers/2066.html">first</a> at the end of 1995, and the second and <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/nextstep3.3_patch_3_overview.pdf">third</a> in late 1999. Since NeXT were acquired by Apple in 1997, this patch was made by Apple to address Y2k bugs and other longstanding issues. Thanks, Apple! <a href="https://youtu.be/gaI6kBVyu00?t=28"><em>Thapple</em></a>.</p>
<p>The third patch is a cumulative update, so that should be all I need. Nextcomputers.org generously <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/">hosts</a> the patch for download. Because I’m using an HP PA-RISC machine, I need <code>NS33RISCUserPatch3.tar</code>. System updates need to be installed as the <code>root</code> user, and if you run them as <code>me</code> (the default user) NeXTstep doesn’t prompt to escalate privilges, it just gives an error. Thus, I need to log in as <code>root</code> directly. In order to do that, I need to give the <code>me</code> user a password so the system will stop automatically logging in at boot (giving me a chance to log in as <code>root</code>). To set a password, you go to Preferences.app and navigate to the lock icon.</p>

<p>After a reboot, I’m on the most recent version of NeXTstep for PA-RISC, and ready for the year 2000!</p>

<p>What’s next for making a usable system? Developer tools! <strong>NeXTstep came on two sets of discs - “User” for the main operating system, and the optional “Developer” disc</strong> with compilers, GUI building tools, libraries, and documentation. While there were separate versions of NeXTstep User for CISC (m68k and i386) and RISC (PA-RISC and SPARC) platforms, the Developer disc is “quad-fat” - it contains binaries for all four platforms.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>With Apple’s recent announcement that they are moving away from Intel X86 CPU’s to their own ARM CPU’s for future laptops and desktops I thought it would be a good time to take a look at the some differences that can affect systems programmers working in Rust.</p>

<p>One of the key areas where ARM CPU’s differ from X86 is their memory model. This article will take a look at what a memory model is and how it can cause code to be correct on one CPU but cause race conditions on another.</p>

<h2 id="memory-models">Memory Models</h2>

<p>The way loads and stores to memory interact between multiple threads on a specific CPU is called that architecture’s Memory Model.</p>

<p>Depending on the memory model of the CPU, multiple writes by one thread may become visible to another thread in a different order to the one they were issued in.</p>

<p>The same is true of a thread issuing multiple reads. A thread issuing multiple reads may receive “snapshots” of global state that represent points in time ordered differently to the order of issue.</p>

<p>Modern hardware needs this flexibility to be able to maximize the throughput of memory operations. While CPU clock rates and core counts have been increasing with each new CPU iteration, memory bandwidth has struggled to keep up. Moving data from memory to operate on is often the bottle neck in the performance of applications.</p>

<p>If you’ve never written multi-threaded code, or only done so using higher level synchronization primitives such as <code>std::sync::Mutex</code>, you’ve probably never been exposed to the details of the memory model. This is because the CPU, despite whatever reordering it’s memory model allows it to perform, always presents a consistent view of memory to the current thread.</p>

<p>If we look at the below snippet of code that writes to memory and then reads the same memory straight back, we will always get the expected value of <code>58</code> back when we read. There is never the case that we’d read some stale value from memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read_after_write</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>u32_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>();</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"the value is {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_value</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>I’m using volatile operations because if I used normal pointer operations the compiler is smart enough to skip the memory read and just prints the value <code>58</code>. 
Volatile operations stop the compiler from reordering or skipping our memory operation. However they have no affect on hardware (or the compiler re-ordering relative to non-volatile memory operations).</em></p>

<p>Once we introduce multiple threads, we’re now exposed to the fact that the CPU may be reordering our memory operations.</p>

<p>We can examine the snippet below in a multi-threaded context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>(),</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we initialize the contents of both pointers to <code>0</code>, and then run each function in a different thread, we can list the possible outcomes for the reader. We know that there is no synchronization, but based on our experience with single threaded code we think the possible return values are <code>(0, 0)</code>, <code>(58, 0)</code> or <code>(58, 42)</code>. But the possibility of hardware reordering of memory writes affecting multi-threads means that there is a fourth option <code>(0, 42)</code>.</p>

<p>You might think there are more possibilities due to the lack of synchronization. But all hardware memory models guarantee that aligned loads and store up to the native word size are atomic (u32 or a 32-bit CPU, u64 on a 64-bit CPU). If we changed one of our writes to <code>0xFFFF_FFFF</code>, the read will only ever see the old value or the new value. It will never see a partial value like <code>0xFFFF_0000</code>.</p>

<p>If the details of the CPU’s memory model are hidden away when using regular memory accesses, it seems like we would have no way to control it in multi-threaded programs where it affects program correctness.</p>

<p>Luckily Rust provides as with the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module containing types that gives us the control we need. We use these types to specify exactly the memory ordering requirements our code needs. We trade performance for correctness. We place restrictions on what order the hardware can perform memory operations, taking away any bandwidth optimizations the hardware would want to perform.</p>

<p>When working with the <code>atomic</code> module, we don’t worry about the actual memory models of individual CPU architectures. Instead the operation of the <code>atomic</code> module works on an abstract memory model that’s CPU agnostic. Once we’ve expressed our requirements on the loads and stores using this Rust memory model, the compiler does the job of mapping to the memory model of the target CPU.</p>

<p>The requirements we specify on each operation takes the form of what reordering we want to allow (or deny) on the operation. The orderings form a hierarchy, with each level placing more restrictions the CPU. For example <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> means the CPU is free to perform any reordering it wants. <code>Ordering::Release</code> means that a store can only complete after all proceeding stores have finished.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how atomic memory writes are actually compiled, compared to a regular write.</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we look at the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/uVQM8T">X86 assembly</a> for the above code, we see the first three functions produce identical code. It’s not until the stricter <code>SeqCst</code> ordering that we get a different instruction being produced.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_relaxed:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>
        
<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_consistent:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>xchg</span>    <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>eax</span>
        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first two orderings use the <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> (<strong>MOV</strong>e) instruction to write the value to memory. Only the strictest ordering produces a different instruction, <strong><code>XCHG</code></strong> (atomic e<strong>XCH</strong>an<strong>G</strong>), to a raw pointer write.</p>

<p>We can compare that to the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/wWQo8P">ARM assembly</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>str</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_relaxed:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>str</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>
        
<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_consistent:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In contrast we can see there is a difference once we hit the release ordering requirement. The raw pointer and relaxed atomic store use <strong><code>STR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore <strong>R</strong>egister) while the release and sequential ordering uses the instruction <strong><code>STLR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore with re<strong>L</strong>ease <strong>R</strong>egister). <em>The <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> instruction in this disassembly is moving the constant <code>58</code> into a register, it’s not a memory operation.</em></p>

<p>We should be able to see the risk here. The mapping between the theoretical Rust memory model and the X86 memory model is more forgiving to programmer error. It’s possible for us to write code that is wrong with respect to the abstract memory model, but still have it produce the correct assembly code and work correctly on some CPU’s.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-multi-threaded-program-using-atomic-operations">Writing a Multi-Threaded Program using Atomic Operations</h2>

<p>The program we’ll be exploring builds upon the concept of storing a pointer value being atomic across threads. One thread is going to perform some work using a mutable object it owns. Once it’s finished that work it’s going to publish that work as an immutable shared reference, using an atomic pointer write to both signal the work is complete and allow reading threads to use the data.</p>

<h2 id="the-x86-only-implementation">The X86 Only Implementation</h2>

<p>If we really want to test how forgiving the X86’s memory model is, we can write multi-threaded code that skips any use of the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module. I want to stress this is not something you should ever actually consider doing. In fact this code has undefined behavior due to not guarding against possible compiler instruction re-ordering (however in Rust 1.44.1 the compiler doesn’t re-order so the code “works”). This is an learning exercise only.</p>
