<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5563" role="main"><div><div><div><p>A <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study has found</a> that elderly patients who underwent emergency surgery on their surgeon’s birthday had significantly higher 30-day mortality rates than patients whose surgery took place on any other day of the year. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>The 30-day mortality rate (defined as death within 30 days after surgery)&nbsp;for the “surgeon’s birthday” group was 6.9%. This was 23% higher than the 5.6% rate for the “other day” group.</p><p>The study, which appears today in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BMJ</a>),&nbsp;looked at 980,876 procedures performed in US hospitals by 47,489 surgeons.&nbsp;Of those procedures, 2,064 (0.2%) took place on a surgeon’s birthday.&nbsp;The patients were all Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 99. They had all undergone one of 17 common emergency surgical procedures between 2011 and 2014.</p><h2>Distractions during the most common emergency surgery types</h2><p>Examples of those 17 procedures included cardiovascular surgeries, hip and femur fracture, appendectomy, and small bowel resection. The study focused on&nbsp;emergency surgery, so as to&nbsp;minimize the potential selection bias. For example, surgeons might otherwise choose patients based on their illness severity, or patients might choose their surgeon.</p><p>As the authors write, “The effect size of surgeons’ birthday observed in our analysis (1.3 percentage point increase or a 23% increase in mortality), though substantial, is comparable to the impact of other events, including holidays (e.g., Christmas and New Year) and weekends.” <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>In fact, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3m5rimG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history of surgery</a> has often demonstrated that external factors can influence surgical outcomes. The authors refer to a 2014 study showing that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23345314/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patients admitted to Scottish emergency rooms on&nbsp;public holidays had a 27% increase</a> in 30-day mortality.&nbsp;Other research has found, for example,&nbsp;that doctors are more likely to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1910546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prescribe antibiotics</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2749268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opioids</a> — and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2733171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less likely to order&nbsp;cancer screening tests</a> — as the workday progresses. This is most likely because the “cumulative cognitive demand” of such decisions gradually takes its toll.&nbsp;</p><p>Research on judges has yielded similar results. It has found, for example, that external factors as diverse as outdoor temperatures and sports results can influence judges’ decisions.&nbsp;</p><h2>A natural experiment: ER surgery on the doctor’s birthday</h2><p>But the authors say the “natural experiment” in the present study is more revealing than, for example, holiday-related mortality rates. That is because “those events not only affect physicians’ performance but also influence patients’ decision to seek care (i.e., patients seeking care on these special days might be sicker than those seeking care on other days), as well as hospital staffing.” Unless, of course, the patients know their surgeon’s birthday, which is unlikely (though that may change if this study becomes widely known).&nbsp;</p><p>The 1.3% effect size was the result after a very through series of controls. These included, for example, excluding those surgeons with the highest patient mortality rates. Other controls included assigning a random “pseudo-birthday” to surgeons to see whether the results still held up, or checking whether the surgeon did an above-average number of procedures on their birthday. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>Likewise, the researchers controlled for “milestone” birthdays (such as 40 or 50). They also controlled for whether a birthday fell on a Friday, which might make after-work birthday festivities more likely.&nbsp;Their findings also held up when the analysis was restricted to procedures with the highest average mortality, or to only the most ill patients.&nbsp;In fact, without these adjustments, the 30-day mortality rate difference between the birthday and non-birthday groups (the unadjusted rate) was even higher (7.0% vs. 5.6%, or a 1.4% difference).</p><h2><strong>Why</strong> does emergency surgery suffer on surgeon’s birthday?</h2><p>The authors propose a few potential explanations for this “birthday effect.”&nbsp;</p><p>These include hurrying through an emergency surgery to be on time for after-work birthday events; <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/study-finds-users-not-notifications-initiate-89-of-smartphone-interactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">distracting</a> birthday-related phone calls or text messages; more conversations with well-wishing staff members; and a decreased likelihood to go back to the hospital that evening if a patient’s condition deteriorates.</p><p>They also found that some surgeons did not work on their birthdays. While 2,144 surgeons in this study performed procedures one day before their birthday, and 2,027 did so one day after their birthday, only 1,805 surgeons carried out procedures on their actual birthday. This does not affect the results of the study’s analyses. But it does suggest “that birthdays are an important enough factor for some surgeons to choose not to operate on that day, which supports the credibility of our assumption that a birthday could be a distracting factor for those surgeons who choose to operate on that day,” the authors write.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Limitations</strong> <strong>and future directions</strong></h2><p>The researchers emphasized that this study focused on common procedures, and on older Medicare patients. This means that the findings may not apply to other types of patients, or to other surgical procedures.</p><p>Still, the authors write, these results may lead to “additional support for surgeons who have potentially distracting events,” such as birthdays, “to make sure that patients receive high quality surgical care regardless of when undergo surgery.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patient mortality after surgery on the surgeon’s birthday: observational study</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirotaka Kato, Anupam B.

<h2>INTRO</h2>



<p>A few years ago, I got the opportunity to architect and code the fire propagation system in Far Cry 2. &nbsp;At that time, &nbsp;it was a gigantic task and it scared the hell out of me. Luckily, it turned out well enough.</p>



<p>With the upcoming Far Cry 3, several people recently asked me how the system worked. I realized that I never took the time to write it down. So, before I forget and also because it might be useful to somebody out there, here’s a high level overview of its inner workings. &nbsp;Pretty programmer art included as a bonus.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: Although Far Cry 3 uses the same system I wrote, I was not involved in the project. They may or may not have changed / adapted or modified the algorithms. What I describe below is accurate for Far Cry 2.</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h2>BASE STRUCTURE</h2>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>A 2D Grid good for grass fire. &nbsp;Here, a fire cell has 50 hitpoints</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the core, the fire propagation system is quite simple. Since gameplay is what’s important, we&nbsp;sacrifice some of the realism for fun. The fire propagation in&nbsp;Far Cry 2 &nbsp;(and Far Cry 3) has just enough realism to maintain the player’s&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a>,&nbsp;but certainly not enough to get published anytime soon. Because I like to&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep things simple</a>, it doesn’t involve any complicated mathematics, physics or fluid dynamics. That has the additional advantage to be fast to simulate and easy to understand.</p>



<p>The secret sauce is an&nbsp;equally spaced grid. It is true for grass, for objects as well as for trees. The only difference is that we use a 2D grid for grass and a 3D grid for objects and trees.</p>



<p>Each cell of the grid has a position in the world, a radius and&nbsp;<strong>hitpoints</strong>. The cells have a plethora of&nbsp;properties, but these three are the bare minimum to propagate fire.</p>



<h2>LIGHT MY FIRE! HOW TO START ONE?</h2>



<p>The game engine tracks all damage done in the game, might it be bullet shots, impacts or fire damage. When a game entity is damaged, it is notified by an event. The damage event includes how much damage was done, what kind it was and what caused it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the kind of damage was fire based and the entity is flammable, then at least two things happen:</p>



<ul><li>Firstly, the fire grid is dynamically created for the damaged entity. We create them dynamically because we don’t want those grids&nbsp;to exist in the wild for no reasons. That would take memory, disk space, etc, so we create them as we go. But, once created, it remains as long as the game entity exists.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Secondly, we figure out which cell in the grid is closest to the damage source. That cell then takes the damage and its hitpoints are reduced accordingly.</li></ul>



<p>That’s where things get interesting – When a cell has been damaged by fire and has lost all its hitpoints;&nbsp;<strong>it catches fire</strong>.</p>



<p>While burning, the cell becomes a damager itself. It deals damage to its neighbour cells on the grid; cells that share an edge with it. By doing so, it reduces their hitpoints and when in turns these cells have lost all their hitpoints, they catch fire. That’s how the propagation is created.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridBiggerFire1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridBiggerFire1.jpg 700w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridBiggerFire1-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><figcaption>Fire propagating from left to right. The cells on the fire front are being damaged.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Lastly, a cell from the grid as a finite lifetime. Otherwise, it would burn forever. It can be seen as the amount of energy given by the material that is burning. &nbsp;For instance,&nbsp;a piece of paper would most likely burn faster than a wood log, so it would be given a shorter lifetime value.</p>



<p>That’s it. A fully functional fire propagation system good enough for a AAA game!</p>



<h2>TECHNICALITIES</h2>



<p><strong>Simulate wet jungle VS dry patch of grass</strong><br>How to simulate a wet jungle versus a dry patch of grass? They behave differently. Quite easily!<br>Increase the fire cell’s hitpoints and it’s difficult to set it on fire and it’s slow to propagate.&nbsp;Decrease its burning lifetime and the fire dies out quickly. There, you just simulated a wet jungle environment.</p>



<p><strong>How to create the propagation grids</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Grass / Land</em></strong><br>For grass wildfire, &nbsp;an axis-aligned 2D grid is built in realtime and projected on a 3D terrain. For each of the cell, we take care to determine if the cell position is underwater, or under an object such as a rock or a building. In which case, we disable that cell and it can no longer catch fire. We wouldn’t want to have fire propagating under rock, would we?<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDisabled.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDisabled.jpg 512w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDisabled-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>2D grid projected on a terrain. The cells under the rock are disabled.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Objects</em></strong><br>For objects, it’s a little bit more complicated. First, we create an&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume">AABB</a>&nbsp;that entirely surrounds the object. &nbsp;Second, we somehow&nbsp;need to detect the shape of that object. After all, it could be a chair, an oil barrel or a whole house for all we know. To accomplish that, the &nbsp;bounding box is divided in equally spaced cubes.&nbsp;The size of each cube depends of the object size, the number of fire emitter we want to have, performance, memory, etc.</p>



<p>An iterative algorithm then go through all those cubes and test their location against the collision shape of the object.&nbsp;If the test return a positive result, this cube is kept, otherwise it is discarded. At the end, we have a collection of cubes that approximately&nbsp;represent the shape of the object to be burned. That’s our propagation grid.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3DGrid.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3DGrid.jpg 800w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3DGrid-300x183.jpg 300w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3DGrid-768x469.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>Detection of the shape of an object</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2><strong>WIND EFFECT</strong></h2>



<p>The wind is an important disruptive factor for a wildfire and it adds a great layer of realism for the player. &nbsp;Here it could be tempting to&nbsp;over-think&nbsp;the design and go with a very complicated system. After all, it’s an active area of research and&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748912001988">several</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475407002030">papers</a>&nbsp;on the subject are available online.</p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-s2.0-S0378475407002030-gr3-300x235-1.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-s2.0-S1540748912001988-gr3.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Luckily, with what have been explained thus far, it’s quite easy to simulate if we accept to cut corners a bit.</p>



<p>In our system, the fire propagates by damaging the&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cells on a grid. And it is generally accepted that a fire should spread faster in the direction of the wind than against&nbsp;the wind? Then, with that in mind, we can create a rule where a burning cell deals more damage to its&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cells if that neighbor is in the direction of the wind.</p>



<p>We do that by getting the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot product</a>&nbsp;between the wind direction&nbsp;vector and the direction of the&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cell to damage.&nbsp;If the result is greater than zero, then that node is dealt greater damage. &nbsp;Likewise, if the result is negative, &nbsp;the node is against the wind and should be dealt less damage. To be fancy, the amount of damage is interpolated with the dot product result as shown in the picture below.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>The cell on fire causes more damage to its neighbor cells if they are in the direction of the wind.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With that rule alone, you will get a nice bell shaped fire front that propagates in the direction of the wind. Simple, yet believable&nbsp;enough to get the player’s stamp of approval.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that we simulate gravity the exact same way.</p>



<h2>PROPAGATING TO THINGS AROUND AND CHAIN REACTIONS</h2>



<p>When a cell burns, it sends a “I’m on fire and I burn this much in this radius” message down&nbsp;the game event pipeline. This event is caught by objects, AI and other game systems that are in that area. They react&nbsp;to this message their own specific ways. The AI freaks out, the flammable objects get damaged and eventually catch fire. And, &nbsp;it is also true for dynamic objects. &nbsp;For example, if a burning oil barrel goes flying through the map, every step of the way, &nbsp;it will send that “i’m burning” message and a lot of things around might hear it.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone.jpg 719w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone-300x284.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px"><figcaption>In the absence of wind, a cell on fire damages equally all its neighbors.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>This causes a chain reaction effect where trees, explosive items, &nbsp;objects and patches of grass set each others on fire. &nbsp;It’s completely&nbsp;systemic and it makes it much more believable. It &nbsp;also scores pretty high on the&nbsp;player’s&nbsp;fun meter because it behaves as one would expect, yet as real fire, it sometimes gets totally out of control.</p>



<h2>OPTIMISATION</h2>



<p><strong>The Hair Transplant Strategy</strong></p>



<p>In an ideal world, we would have access to enough memory to hold&nbsp;an infinite number of particle emitters and we could display an infinite number of particles on screen.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the reality is that those numbers are actually pretty low.</p>



<p>To do more with less, we have to put our emitters where it really counts. Enters the hair transplant strategy! &nbsp;In Far Cry 2, the fire emitters are constantly being teleported around, most importantly, from the back of the camera to the front. The player’s point of view is monitored at all time and emitters that are burning out of sight are moved to a better location where they are also needed.</p>



<p>In addition, the emitters’s density is higher in close proximity of the player and lower as the distance increases. A kind of fire&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail">LOD&nbsp;</a>if you will.&nbsp;If things are getting bad and we still need more emitters but none are available, we increase the particle sizes to give them more volume and fill more space on screen.</p>



<p>With this strategy, and some others, we can simulate a wildfire that is several meters wide with a relatively low number of particle emitters.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>Credits: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Event Pipeline</strong><br>Since the described system tried to avoid all complicated maths, generally speaking we will be GPU bound before being&nbsp;CPU bound.</p>



<p>That being said, the event pipeline could be a bottleneck. It works well when you have just a few cells on fire. But, it’s another story when you have thousands of them burning and&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;their state to the world. That will likely clog your CPU’s arteries.</p>



<p>The trick for me was to regroup the cells that were burning into&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis-aligned_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AABB</a>&nbsp;groups. These groups would constantly merge, split and&nbsp;change shape to follow the evolution of the fire. The events would then be sent per AABB instead of per cell, which saves&nbsp;a significant amount of processing power. Additionally, the events would be spread out across several frames in order to distribute the load and avoid framerate spikes.</p>



<p><strong>Keeping things under control.</strong><br>In your game, if you don’t constrain the propagation somehow, it will either</p>

<p>Jesus this is a… thing.</p>
<p>Listen, don’t go to LS. It’s a waste of money. If you think you will be working on team projects, you won’t. That was my assumption, too, but the truth is that you are too busy doing course busywork to work on actual projects, and when you finally DO work on a group project, 75% of your group is so unequipped to handle working on literally ANYTHING, that if you are experienced in ANY way, you will be holding everyone’s hand teaching them basic shit that the course should have taught them.</p>
<p>All I got for my time in LS was a github account that looked awful, with half-assed project repos clogging up everything. You will come out of it all and literally remove ALL of them, because they are THAT shameful.</p>
<p>Do not go to this school. Go literally anywhere else.</p>
<p>And in all honesty, if you actually HAVE some experience like your linkedin says, you should just work on your own stuff. Don’t get suckered into this place by slick marketing that sounds like they’re high-speed. They’re just a terrible version of a votech school, except every class will have 200 students and 1 instructor.</p>
<p>HARD PASS on LS. Take Udemy courses and network on slack/discord servers instead, and save yourself months of your life and 10k’s of $.”</p>
<p><strong>Original post: </strong>My mission is to solve the world’s most pressing problems using technology. I’m 30 and haven’t solved a single world pressing problem. So it’s time to stop wasting my time web surfing and go head to head with Bill Gates (put a computer on every desktop running Microsoft software and now reducing inequities and improving lives around the world), Elon Musk (Starlink fast worldwide satellite internet and electric transportation and solar energy generation and storage), John Krafcik (Waymo’s CEO eliminating fatal car crashes with already live self driving cars with no employees inside picking up paying public customers). So my game plan is to spend 15 hours a day starting 12/16/20 going to web development school (starts 1/11/21), reading software development and business books, creating highly profitable startups, writing well researched informative blog posts and daily journal blog posts about my journey, and applying to software development jobs at early stage product market fit companies.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<section itemprop="text">

<p>I get confused with tensor computation libraries (or computational graph libraries, or symbolic
algebra libraries, or whatever they’re marketing themselves as these days).</p>
<p>I was first introduced to PyTorch and TensorFlow and, having no other reference, thought they were
prototypical examples of tensor computation libraries. Then I learnt about Theano - an older and
less popular project, but different from PyTorch and TensorFlow and better in some meaningful ways.
This was followed by JAX, which seemed to be basically NumPy with more bells and whistles (although
I couldn’t articulate what exactly they were). Then came <a href="https://pymc-devs.medium.com/the-future-of-pymc3-or-theano-is-dead-long-live-theano-d8005f8a0e9b">the announcement by the PyMC developers
that Theano would have a new JAX
backend</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, this confusion prompted a lot of research and eventually, this blog post.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://eigenfoo.xyz/prob-prog-frameworks/">my previous post on the anatomy of probabilistic programming
frameworks</a>, I’ll first discuss tensor computation
libraries in general - what they are and how they can differ from one another. Then I’ll discuss
some libraries in detail, and finally offer an observation on the future of Theano in the context of
contemporary tensor computation libraries.</p>
<h2 id="dissecting-tensor-computation-libraries">Dissecting Tensor Computation Libraries</h2>
<p>First, a characterization: what do tensor computation libraries even do?</p>
<ol>
<li>They provide ways of specifying and building computational graphs,</li>
<li>They run the computation itself (duh), but also run “related” computations that either (a) <em>use
the computational graph</em>, or (b) operate <em>directly on the computational graph itself</em>,
<ul>
<li>The most salient example of the former is computing gradients via
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05767">autodifferentiation</a>,</li>
<li>A good example of the latter is optimizing the computation itself: think symbolic
simplifications (e.g. <code>xy/x = y</code>) or modifications for numerical stability (e.g. <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/68411"><code>log(1 + x)</code>
for small values of <code>x</code></a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And they provide “best execution” for the computation: whether it’s changing the execution by JIT
(just-in-time) compiling it, by utilizing special hardware (GPUs/TPUs), by vectorizing the
computation, or in any other way.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tensor-computation-library---maybe-not-the-best-name">“Tensor Computation Library” - Maybe Not The Best Name</h3>
<p>As an aside: I realize that the name “tensor computation library” is too broad, and that the
characterization above precludes some libraries that might also justifiably be called “tensor
computation libraries”. Better names might be “graph computation library” (although that might get
mixed up with libraries like <a href="https://networkx.org/"><code>networkx</code></a>) or “computational graph management
library” or even “symbolic tensor algebra libraries”.</p>
<p>So for the avoidance of doubt, here is a list of libraries that this blog post is <em>not</em> about:</p>
<ul>
<li>NumPy and SciPy
<ul>
<li>These libraries don’t have a concept of a computational graph - they’re more like a toolbox of
functions, called from Python and executed in C or Fortran.</li>
<li>However, this might be a controversial distinction - as we’ll see later, JAX also doesn’t build
an explicit computational graph either, and I definitely want to include JAX as a “tensor
computation library”… <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numba and Cython
<ul>
<li>These libraries provide best execution for code (and in fact some tensor computation libraries,
such as Theano, make good use them), but like NumPy and SciPy, they do not actually manage the
computational graph itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keras, Trax, Flax and PyTorch-Lightning
<ul>
<li>These libraries are high-level wrappers around tensor computation libraries - they basically
provide abstractions and a user-facing API to utilize tensor computation libraries in a
friendlier way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-differences-between-tensor-computation-libraries">(Some) Differences Between Tensor Computation Libraries</h3>
<p>Anyways, back to tensor computation libraries.</p>
<p>All three aforementioned goals are ambitious undertakings with sophisticated solutions, so it
shouldn’t be surprising to learn that decisions in pursuit on goal can have implications for (or
even incur a trade-off with!) other goals. Here’s a list of common differences along all three axes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tensor computation libraries can differ in how they represent the computational graph, and how it
is built.
<ul>
<li>Static or dynamic graphs: do we first define the graph completely and then inject data to run
(a.k.a. define-and-run), or is the graph defined on-the-fly via the actual forward computation
(a.k.a. define-by-run)?
<ul>
<li>TensorFlow 1.x was (in)famous for its static graphs, which made users feel like they were
“working with their computational graph through a keyhole”, especially when <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13429355">compared to
PyTorch’s dynamic graphs</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lazy or eager execution: do we evaluate variables as soon as they are defined, or only when a
dependent variable is evaluated? Usually, tensor computation libraries either choose to support
dynamic graphs with eager execution, or static graphs with lazy execution - for example,
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager">TensorFlow 2.0 supports both modes</a>.</li>
<li>Interestingly, some tensor computation libraries (e.g. <a href="https://thinc.ai/">Thinc</a>) don’t even
construct an explicit computational graph: they represent it as <a href="https://thinc.ai/docs/concept">chained higher-order
functions</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tensor computation libraries can also differ in what they want to use the computational graph
<em>for</em> - for example, are we aiming to do things that basically amount to running the
computational graph in a “different mode”, or are we aiming to modify the computational graph
itself?
<ul>
<li>Almost all tensor computation libraries support autodifferentiation in some capacity (either
forward-mode, backward-mode, or both).</li>
<li>Obviously, how you represent the computational graph and what you want to use it for are very
related questions! For example, if you want to be able to represent aribtrary computation as a
graph, you’ll have to handle control flow like if-else statements or for-loops - this leads to
common gotchas with <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#%F0%9F%94%AA-Control-Flow">using Python for-loops in
JAX</a>
or needing to use <a href="https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/can-you-have-for-loops-in-the-forward-prop/68295"><code>torch.nn.ModuleList</code> in for-loops with
PyTorch</a>.</li>
<li>Some tensor computation libraries (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Theano/Theano">Theano</a> and it’s
fork, <a href="https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Theano-PyMC</a>) aim to <a href="https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/optimization.html">optimize
the computational graph
itself</a>, for which an
<a href="#an-observation-on-static-graphs-and-theano">explicit graph is necessary</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, tensor computation libraries can also differ in how they execute code.
<ul>
<li>All tensor computation libraries run on CPU, but the strength of GPU and TPU support is a major
differentiator among tensor computation libraries.</li>
<li>Another differentiator is how tensor computation libraries compile code to be executed on
hardware. For example, do they use JIT compilation or not? Do they use “vanilla” C or CUDA
compilers, or <a href="https://tensorflow.google.cn/xla">the XLA compiler for machine-learning specific
code</a>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-zoo-of-tensor-computation-libraries">A Zoo of Tensor Computation Libraries</h2>
<p>Having outlined the basic similarities and differences of tensor computation libraries, I think
it’ll be helpful to go through several of the popular libraries as examples. I’ve tried to link to
the relevant documentation where possible.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="pytorch"><a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>How is the computational graph represented and built?
<ul>
<li>PyTorch dynamically builds (and eagerly evaluates) an explicit computational graph. For more
detail on how this is done, check out <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html">the PyTorch docs on autograd
mechanics</a>.</li>
<li>For more on how PyTorch computational graphs, see <a href="https://jdhao.github.io/2017/11/12/pytorch-computation-graph/"><code>jdhao</code>’s introductory blog post on
computational graphs in
PyTorch</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the computational graph used for?
<ul>
<li>To quote the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html">PyTorch docs</a>, “PyTorch is an
optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs” - as such, the main focus is on
<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html">autodifferentiation</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the library ensure “best execution” for computation?
<ul>
<li>PyTorch has <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html">native GPU support</a> via CUDA.</li>

<li>How is the computational graph represented and built?
<ul>
<li>Instead of building an explicit computational graph to compute gradients, JAX simply supplies a
<code>grad()</code> that returns the gradient function of any supplied function. As such, there is
technically no concept of a computational graph - only pure (i.e. stateless and
side-effect-free) functions and their gradients.</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sjmielke.com/jax-purify.htm">Sabrina Mielke summarizes the situation very well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PyTorch builds up a graph as you compute the forward pass, and one call to <code>backward()</code> on
some “result” node then augments each intermediate node in the graph with the gradient of the
result node with respect to that intermediate node. JAX on the other hand makes you express
your computation as a Python function, and by transforming it with <code>grad()</code> gives you a
gradient function that you can evaluate like your computation function — but instead of the
output it gives you the gradient of the output with respect to (by default) the first
parameter that your function took as input.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the computational graph used for?
<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html">JAX quickstart</a>,
JAX bills itself as “NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for
high-performance machine learning research”. Hence, its focus is heavily on
autodifferentiation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the library ensure “best execution” for computation?
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is best explained by quoting the <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html">JAX quickstart</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JAX uses XLA to compile and run your NumPy code on […] GPUs and TPUs. Compilation happens
under the hood by default, with library calls getting just-in-time compiled and executed. But
JAX even lets you just-in-time compile your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels
[…] Compilation and automatic differentiation can be composed arbitrarily […]</p>
</blockquote>

<li>

<li>Theano statically builds (and lazily evaluates) an explicit computational graph.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the computational graph used for?
<ul>
<li>Theano is unique among tensor computation libraries in that it places more emphasis on

<p>Today, Pornhub took down all videos from unverified accounts after a New York Times report documented instances of nonconsensual pornography and child sexual abuse material on the service.</p>
<p>But the Times editorial isn't what spurred the shutdown: rather, it was the decision by Visa and Mastercard to withdrawn Pornhub's payment processing that prompted Pornhub to take action.</p>
<p>You may count that as a win. No one with any kind of moral center endorses nonconsensual pornography, especially when it involves children, and the less there is out there, the better the world is. I agree.</p>
<p>But we should also be worried about the growing monopolization of payment processing, and the role that payment processors are coming to play as gatekeepers for all kinds of activities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/visa-and-mastercard-are-trying-dictate-what-you-can-watch-pornhub">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/visa-and-mastercard-are-trying-dictate-what-you-can-watch-pornhub</a></p>
<p>Mastercard and Visa are not qualified to make those calls. More importantly, no one elected them to make those calls. No law requires them to make those calls, and any law that tried would likely be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>If you want a sex industry based on consent and dignity, this should doubly worry you. After all, the first group of people shut down by payment processors' arbitrary judgements about what speech should and should exist were independent sex-workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub">https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub</a></p>
<p>It took years for the payment processors to work their way up to the monopolistic, sprawling porn empire behind Pornhub – a Canadian company called Mindgeek that maintains the pretense that it is headquartered in Luxembourg,a notorious tax-evasion jurisdiction.</p>
<p>There's an old saw that the sex industry are early tech adopters. That's not quite true – rather, people with disfavored views are the first people for whom it's worth figuring out new technologies, since the old ones are unavailable to them.</p>
<p>Porn got into home films because most big cinemas wouldn't screen pornography. They got into VHS because it was easier to duplicate than film. They got into the net because it offered access without social costs of being seen in the adult section of the video rental place.</p>
<p>But while pornographers aren't early adopters, they ARE leading indicators. Pornographers' fights with novel censorship tactics are also trial-runs for using those tactics against OTHER people – and payment processors have already been pressed into service.</p>
<p>Visa and Mastercard threats have been used to block or shut down journalism, self-published books, dating services.</p>
<p>Mindgeek and Pornhub don't need our sympathy, but hard cases make bad law.</p>
<p>With only a few payment processors online, our ability to engage in legal conduct will always be at the mercy of Visa, Mastercard and a handful of others.</p>

<p>If you're charged with a crime, the prosecutor has to prove you did it beyond a reasonable doubt; when it's a civil case, it's up to YOU to prove based on "preponderance of evidence" that you are innocent. A real difference, especially when the accused is an inanimate object.</p>
<p>In civil asset forfeiture, police seize the goods of people they suspect of criminal activity – without the need for a charge or conviction – and sue that property (i.e. "State of Iowa v Six Tons of Bricks") and you pay a lawyer to prove your property's innocence.</p>
<p>If your lawyer loses (or if you can't afford a lawyer), you lose your stuff, and the cops get to keep it or sell it and keep the money as an off-the-books black budget. Cops love this money – it lets them buy military surveillance gear.</p>
<p><a href="https://revealnews.org/article/chicago-and-los-angeles-have-used-dirt-box-surveillance-for-a-decade/">https://revealnews.org/article/chicago-and-los-angeles-have-used-dirt-box-surveillance-for-a-decade/</a></p>
<p>But not just that: one sheriff stole $70k from his townspeople and used the money to buy a muscle car that he only drove to and from work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/feds-want-reimbursement-for-gwinnett-sheriff-70k-muscle-car/zkOidGb5oRfCHGO5RlZGsL/">https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt–politics/feds-want-reimbursement-for-gwinnett-sheriff-70k-muscle-car/zkOidGb5oRfCHGO5RlZGsL/</a></p>
<p>City attorneys have worked with cops in the past to draw up "wish lists" of stuff they'd like to steal. The cops then nose around the owners of that stuff, looking for a pretence to seize it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/police-use-department-wish-list-when-deciding-which-assets-to-seize.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/police-use-department-wish-list-when-deciding-which-assets-to-seize.html</a></p>
<p>Indeed, police departments future budgets projected their forfeiture revenues for years to come, effectively setting a quota for how much they had to steal from people each year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/dc-police-plan-for-future-seizure-proceeds-years-in-advance-in-city-budget-documents/2014/11/15/7025edd2-6b76-11e4-b053-65cea7903f2e_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/dc-police-plan-for-future-seizure-proceeds-years-in-advance-in-city-budget-documents/2014/11/15/7025edd2-6b76-11e4-b053-65cea7903f2e_story.html</a></p>
<p>By 2014, US police were stealing more from the people they were sworn to protect than all the nation's burglars combined.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/north_america/americas-current-economy/police-civil-asset-forfeitures-exceed-all-burglaries-in-2014/">https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/north_america/americas-current-economy/police-civil-asset-forfeitures-exceed-all-burglaries-in-2014/</a></p>
<p>No wonder that by 2015 Congress ended the program (don't worry, Trump reinstated and expanded it):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/23/the-feds-just-shut-down-a-huge-program-that-lets-cops-take-your-stuff-and-keep-it/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/23/the-feds-just-shut-down-a-huge-program-that-lets-cops-take-your-stuff-and-keep-it/</a></p>
<p>Long after the program was ended, cops insisted that without forfeiture, they lacked the "incentive" to fight crime:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/taken/2019/02/03/sc-civil-forfeiture-police-defend-practice-say-funds-essential-law-enforcement/2746412002/">https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/taken/2019/02/03/sc-civil-forfeiture-police-defend-practice-say-funds-essential-law-enforcement/2746412002/</a></p>
<p>They predicted that without forfeiture, police budgets would be too strained to fight crime, while criminals' coffers would swell. That was the scare-story New Mexico's legislature heard in 2015 when the state ended civil forfeiture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/police-say-seizing-property-without-trial-helps-keep-crime-down-a-new-study-shows-theyre-wrong">https://www.propublica.org/article/police-say-seizing-property-without-trial-helps-keep-crime-down-a-new-study-shows-theyre-wrong</a></p>
<p>Five years later, the verdict is in, and the cops' predictions were wrong. A new report from The Institute for Justice shows that NM experienced no rise in crime, no drop in arrests, and "arrest/offense rates consistent with trends in two neighboring states, CO and TX."</p>
<p><a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/">https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/</a></p>
<p>The study shows that far from being an instrument to return stolen goods or make restitution to crime victims, forfeiture is a way to fatten police budgets and personally enrich police officials. The seizures are mostly small-dollar amounts (not drug dealer money).</p>
<p>The larger seizures tell an even worse story: they include numerous instances in which a family home was seized because an underage offender sold small quantities of drugs from the premises – leaving families to spend fortunes defending their homes, often unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>Back in September, we got a glimpse of upcoming EU tech competition rules, courtesy of a leak from the European Commission; they set out an ambitious set of rules on mergers, self-dealing, surveillance, and interoperability.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/30/death-to-all-monopoly/#whither-structural-separation">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/30/death-to-all-monopoly/#whither-structural-separation</a></p>
<p>The proposal wasn't perfect, but it was still exciting and encouraging, especially the interoperability proposals. Interop, after all, is the judo that every one of today's tech giants used to beat the companies that came before them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/samba-versus-smb-adversarial-interoperability-judo-network-effects">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/samba-versus-smb-adversarial-interoperability-judo-network-effects</a></p>
<p>Today, the Commission published the first public draft of its rules (these need to get through the EU Parliament and the Council of national governments):</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en</a></p>
<p>The Digital Markets Act and its companion, the Digital Services Act, are the first major update to EU e-commerce rules in nearly two decades. A LOT has changed since the E-Commerce Directive!</p>
<p>For a quick overview, I recommend my EFF colleagues Christoph Schmon and Karen Gullo's analysis:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/european-commissions-proposed-regulations-require-platforms-let-users-appeal">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/european-commissions-proposed-regulations-require-platforms-let-users-appeal</a></p>
<p>The good news: the proposal requires due process for content removal – not a system where filters remove your content in an eyeblink and then you spend months or years in autoresponder hell trying to get it back up.</p>
<p>It doesn't require giant companies to police their users' speech, a rule that has led to mass-scale censorship, especially targeted against marginalized people who lack the platform and resources to complain when they get blocked.</p>
<p>It includes <em>very</em> steep penalties for companies that don't comply (up to 6% of annual global revenue), and a means to reach beyond EU borders to sanction companies that do business in the EU – both measures are powerful and potentially dangerous, and both need more specifics.</p>
<p>One disappointment: the interoperability measures have been weakened since September's leaks, though Article 6 of the Digital Markets Act is still a strict and far-reaching set of pro-competition rules with some look-in for interop.</p>
<p>Here's some A6 highlights, rules for the largest tech companies ("gatekeeper companies"):</p>
<ul>
<li>A ban on combining platform data with data from third parties and on automatically logging users from one service on a platform to other ones
</li>
<li>
<p>A requirement to let businesses on the platform offer services and pricing that directly competes with the platform owner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A requirement to let businesses on the platform do subscription and payment with users on their own terms, without having to use the platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ban on blocking businesses on the platform from complaining about abuses to regulators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ban on …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

			<h2>Estimated 1.56 billion face masks will have entered oceans in 2020 - OceansAsia Report  
For Immediate Release: December 7, 2020

				<div data-id="e99a48e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">

					<div><p>Our oceans will be flooded with an estimated 1.56 billion face masks in 2020 says a report released today by Hong-Kong-based marine conservation organization OceansAsia. This will result in an additional 4,680 to 6,240 metric tonnes of marine plastic pollution, says the report, entitled “Masks on the Beach: The Impact of COVID-19 on Marine Plastic Pollution.” These masks will take as long as 450 years to break down, slowly turning into&nbsp; micro plastics while negatively impacting marine wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
<p>The report used a global production estimate of 52 billion masks being manufactured in 2020, a conservative loss rate of 3%, and the average weight of 3 to 4 grams for a single-use polypropylene surgical face mask to arrive at the estimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The 1.56 billion face masks that will likely enter our oceans in 2020 are just the tip of the iceberg,” says Dr. Teale Phelps Bondaroff, Director of Research for OceansAsia, and lead author of the report. “The 4,680 to 6,240 metric tonnes of face masks are just a small fraction of the estimated 8 to 12 million metric tonnes of plastic that enter our oceans each year.”</p></div>

					<div><p>Plastic consumption, which has been steadily rising for years, increased significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“Hygiene concerns and greater reliance on take-away food has led to increased use of plastics, particularly plastic packaging,” says Gary Stokes, Director of Operations of OceansAsia. “Meanwhile, a number of measures designed to reduce plastic consumption, like single-use plastic bag bans, have been delayed, paused, or rolled back.”</p><p>The use of PPE, in particular face masks, has become a common tool used in preventing the spread of the virus, with many jurisdictions mandating the wearing of masks in public. The production of PPE has expanded in an attempt to meet skyrocketing demand, and PPE waste has also increased dramatically.&nbsp;</p><p>Single-use face masks are made from a variety of meltblown plastics and are difficult to recycle due to both composition and risk of contamination and infection. They enter oceans when they are littered, when waste management systems are inadequate or non-existent, or when these systems become overwhelmed due to increased volumes of waste.</p><p>“Marine plastic pollution is devastating our oceans,” says Gary Stokes, Operations Director of OceansAsia. “Plastic pollution kills an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and turtles, over a million seabirds, and even greater numbers of fish, invertebrates and other animals each year. It also negatively impacts fisheries and the tourism industry, and costs the global economy an estimated $13 billion USD per year.”</p></div>

					<div><p>The report asks people to wear reusable masks whenever possible, dispose of masks responsibly and reduce their overall consumption of single-use plastic. It also calls on governments to:</p><ul><li>Implement policies designed to encourage the use of reusable masks, such as releasing guidelines regarding the proper manufacture and use of reusable masks.</li><li>Foster innovation and the development of sustainable alternatives to single-use plastic masks.</li><li>Discourage littering by increasing fines, and educate the public about responsible ways to dispose of masks.&nbsp;</li><li>Repair and improve waste management systems to reduce losses and spillage.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“It is critical that we work to reduce our use of single-use plastics, and we all have a role to play,” says Dr. Phelps Bondaroff. “There are reusable and sustainable options for almost every single single-use plastic item. Please wear a reusable mask, unless absolutely necessary, and be sure to dispose of all masks responsibly.</p></div>

These are the first services available from Expo Application Services (EAS), our new cloud services.</p><h2 id="233e">Feature Preview</h2><p id="1abe">EAS Build is a new service that takes everything good about the Expo build service (<code>expo build:[ios|android]</code>) and makes it available to all React Native apps. You can set your app up to build for distribution in minutes or even less, thanks to <a href="https://docs.expo.io/app-signing/managed-credentials/" rel="noopener">automatically managed app signing credentials</a> and defaults that <em>just work</em> for most Expo and React Native apps.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Terminal window running EAS Build in order to configure a new project, generate a keystore, and start a build." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2304/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png" width="1152" height="684" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>In this screenshot, we go from a brand new project to release build running on EAS Build in 30 seconds.</figcaption></figure><p id="83b0">We’ve also added support for “<a href="https://docs.expo.io/build/internal-distribution/" rel="noopener">internal distribution</a>” — a feature that makes it easy for you to share test builds with colleagues and friends without going through an app store, by using <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/iosbuild-with-adhoc-provision-profile" rel="noopener">ad hoc provisioning</a> on iOS and standard APK side-loading on Android. Generating and updating the ad hoc provisioning profile can be handled entirely for you by EAS Build.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7148/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png" width="3574" height="1018" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Easily share builds with your team using “<a href="https://docs.expo.io/build/internal-distribution/" rel="noopener">internal distribution”</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="2d9a">EAS Build <em>currently</em> works best with bare React Native apps. If you use the Expo managed workflow and end up needing to move to the bare workflow, you can transition seamlessly to EAS Build — just run <code>eas build</code> instead of <code>expo build</code> after ejecting.</p><h2 id="7c43">Coming later in 2021: full support for Expo managed workflow</h2><p id="608d">With EAS Build, you can include libraries with native code that aren’t part of the Expo standard library. For many of you, the Expo managed workflow is nearly a perfect fit — except for that one piece of functionality you absolutely have to have in your app, but that isn’t part of the Expo standard library (whether that’s <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/in-app-purchases" rel="noopener">IAP</a> support, <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/webrtc" rel="noopener">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/bluetooth-api" rel="noopener">Bluetooth</a>, or something more <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/data-over-sound" rel="noopener">esoteric</a>).</p><p id="9e41">EAS Build will let you use any compatible library from GitHub or npm or that you write yourself, even if it has native code in it.</p><p id="c8c2">EAS Build also lets you build smaller, stripped-down binaries that include only the code your application needs, which means <a href="https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/master/managed-app-size.md" rel="noopener">a smaller install size for your users</a>.</p><p id="339b">There’s already early support for Expo managed apps in EAS Build in the preview, but it’s not quite ready for production yet. There’s also a big missing piece: how do you get a new version of your Expo development client app that includes your bespoke native runtime? We’re working on this, and we’ll have answers for you in the coming months.</p><p id="a288">These are some of the most common requests we hear from Expo developers today, so we’re extremely excited to be close to getting a solution into your hands.</p><h2 id="8c79">Feature Preview</h2><p id="40a1">When you want to put your app into the App Store and Play Store, you can use a single command from your terminal or from CI to submit it.</p><p id="c0ac">When you run <code>eas submit</code>, your app binary will be uploaded to EAS and then submitted to the respective app store from there. This means fewer dependencies to install on your machine, and that you can submit your apps from your Windows, Linux, or macOS computer to any app store.</p><p id="1d7c">We guide you through your first submission and try to make your <em>n</em>th submission as easy as possible by catching common mistakes and giving you guidance on how to resolve them. For example, if you’re missing a privacy policy, <a href="https://expo.fyi/missing-privacy-policy" rel="noopener">we have an FYI for that</a>.</p><p id="4905"><strong><em>Expo</em></strong> is the open source project, and <strong><em>Expo Application Services</em></strong> offers hosted cloud services built for both Expo and React Native.</p><p id="6d1f"><strong>You won’t need EAS to use Expo, </strong>which will always be open source and free. You can choose a different CI/CD service or use your own hardware.</p><p id="0569">Likewise, <strong>you’ll be able to take advantage of EAS with any React Native project, whether or not it uses Expo’s open source tools</strong>. EAS is designed for developers who specifically want their builds, updates and/or other parts of their app operations, development and collaboration workflows streamlined by a cloud service designed purposefully for and deeply integrated with React Native and Expo.</p><p id="ea39">We don’t want to disrupt anyone who is counting on Expo services to make software, and so we’ll continue to operate the existing build, update, and notification services indefinitely. So, if you’re happy with the way you’re using those services now, you don’t need to do anything differently and you can continue using them.</p><p id="84cc">To reduce confusion with EAS versions of the services, we’re going to start calling the existing free services the “Classic” Expo services. So, “Classic” Build, Updates, and Notifications.</p><p id="a6f7">That said, EAS is where most of our investment and effort on the services side will go in the future, so you should expect to see each EAS service keep getting better, more powerful, and easier to use as time goes on. Keep an eye out for the EAS Update preview, launching in early 2021.</p><p id="c6cd">We’ll always maintain a free tier that can meet the needs of individual and hobbyist developers building small apps. We’ll announce further pricing details closer to the date when EAS services graduate from preview in 2021.</p><p id="be36">If you’re currently paying for Expo Developer Services, we’ve automatically updated your plan to EAS Priority Plan. EAS Priority will have the same price point and feature set as your old Developer Services plan, plus preview access to EAS Build and Submit. You don’t need to do anything: you’ll be moved over automatically.</p><p id="7bc9">The previews of EAS Build and Submit are available to developers subscribed to the <a href="https://expo.io/pricing" rel="noopener">EAS Priority Plan</a>. If you’re not yet a subscriber, <a href="https://expo.io/pricing" rel="noopener">you can try it out for free for a month</a>. If you want to try the preview services out but don’t have access to a credit card, please reach out to us <a href="https://www.twitter.com/expo" rel="noopener">on Twitter</a> and we can help you out.</p><p id="9298">Once you’re signed up, you can find everything that you need to know in the <a href="https://docs.expo.io/eas" rel="noopener">Feature Preview documentation</a>. If you’d like to watch a quick video walkthrough of EAS Build and Submit, check out this YouTube video:</p><figure><div></div></figure></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The subject of Artificial Intelligence piques my interest and I’m constantly studying and trying new things in this field.</p><p>It is notorious how the technologies related to Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and such have emerged and evolved into solutions used by millions of users every day.</p><p>Even though people use the term "Artificial Intelligence", we are still far away from something as advanced as a Skynet from the Terminator movies.</p><p>The most common subfield of AI used today is the one called Machine Learning, which, in its turn, has Deep Learning as subfield steeply growing every day for quite some time now.</p><p>In this guide, I aim to describe a path to follow for software engineers to begin understanding how Machine Learning works and how to apply it to your projects.</p><p>Yeah, you can just go to Google API’s or Amazon and pick some magical API to do Speech Recognition for you, but the value of knowing how it works, why it works and even more, how to make your own API as a Service and tune it to your specific needs is incredible.</p><p>Remember, as a developer, every tool is a new power.</p><p>I’ve read, watched and gone through all these resources until the end, even got a paid certification for some, even though it is not necessary to learn, I find myself more engaged to finish when I have some deadline and assessment to prove I actually learned the material.</p><p>Let’s dive into the topics.</p><p>Python is the main language these days when working with Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.</p><p>If you need a crash course on Python, here is your guide: <a href="https://renanmf.com/the-python-guide-for-beginners/">The Python Guide for Beginners</a>.</p><h2>The Basics: Math!</h2><p>Maybe you never had the chance to study some college-level math, or you did study it but you can’t remember most of the stuff because JavaScript and CSS took all the memory of those topics away.</p><p>There are 3 topics you must know beforehand, or at least have a decent grasp of to follow any good material on ML and DL: Linear Algebra, Calculus and Statistics.</p><p>If you’d like to go deep in learning the math needed to ML and DL, you can look for MIT OpenCourseWare classes like Professor Strang’s renowned <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">Linear Algebra</a> class.</p><p>I’ve watched it in college in parallel with my regular class and it is very good.</p><p>But, let’s face it, most people have no time for that or the patience.</p><p>So I will give you the crash course for the 3 topics mentioned above.</p><h3>Linear Algebra</h3><p>Just watch the whole series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a> from the Youtube channel 3Blue1Brown.</p><p>The guy makes visual explanations of once hard concepts incredibly easy!</p><p>It is very far in terms of content compared to Professor Strang’s, but it’s enough, to begin with, and you can go after other topics as you advance in ML and DL.</p><h3>Calculus</h3><p>Guess what?</p><p>3Blue1Brown also has a whole series on Calculus on Youtube for you to watch for free: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a>.</p><p>Again, he is very good at giving you the intuition of why and how rather than just throw some random equations on your face.</p><h3>Statistics</h3><p>This is a whole field that, in my opinion, you can learn as needed, a good reference is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962">Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts</a>.</p><p>An objective book with some good examples for every concept.</p><p>Fast to read too.</p><p>As the title implies, it is more suitable for Data Scientists, but understanding some basics of statistics is always good and this is what this is book is for.</p><p>You won’t become a statistician after reading it, but you will learn some good stuff.</p><h2>The Bypassed: Machine Learning</h2><p>Everybody wants to jump straight into Deep Learning and be the cool guy training a single model for a week on a 12GB GPU.</p><p>But to get Deep Learning right, you need to go through Machine Learning first!</p><h3>Start from the beginning</h3><p>The concepts, the train of thought, the "feeling" of how things work start here and there is no one else more capable of teaching those concepts than Professor Andrew Ng in his course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>.</p><p>You may think this course is old and outdated, well, technology-wise, maybe, but conceptually-wise, it is better than anything else out there.</p><p>Professor Ng makes it easy to understand the math applied in every technique he teaches and gives you a solid understanding of what happens underneath in a very short and concise course.</p><p>All the exercises are made in Octave, a free version of Matlab of sorts, and you finish the course implementing your own Neural Network!</p><p>The syntax in Octave is easy to grasp for any programmer, so don’t let that be a barrier for you.</p><p>Once you finish the course, you will have implemented all the major algorithms and will be able to solve several prediction problems.</p><h3>Random Forests</h3><p>I said all the major algorithms, right?</p><p>Actually, there is but one flaw in Andrew Ng’s course, he doesn’t cover Random Forests.</p><p>An awesome complement to his course is fast.ai’s <a href="http://course18.fast.ai/ml">Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders</a>.</p><p>Jeremy Howard goes super practical on the missing piece in Ng’s course covering a topic that is, for many classical problems, the best solution out there.</p><p>Fast.ai’s approach is what is called Top-Down, meaning they show you how to solve the problem and then explain why it worked, which is the total opposite of what we are used to in school.</p><p>Jeremy also uses real-world tools and libraries, so you learn by coding in industry-tested solutions.</p><h2>Deep Learning</h2><p>Finally!</p><p>The reason why we are all here, Deep Learning!</p><p>Again, the best resource for it is Professor Ng’s course, actually, a series of courses.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/">Deep Learning Specialization</a> is composed of 5 courses total going from the basics and evolving on specific topics such as language, images, and time-series data.</p><p>One nice thing is that he continues from the very end of his classical Machine Learning course, so it just feels like an extension of the first course.</p><p>The math, the concepts, the notion of how and why it works, he delivers it all very concisely like few I’ve seen.</p><p>The only drawback is that he uses <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> 1.x (Google’s DL Framework) in this course, but that’s minimal detail in my opinion since the explanations and exercises are so well delivered.</p><p>You can pick up the most recent version of the framework relatively easy and to do so there is the final piece of this guide, a book.</p><h3>Too much stuff, give me something faster</h3><p>This book might be the only thing you need to start, it is Aurélien Géron’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems</a>.</p><p>It covers a lot, from classical Machine Learning to the most recent Deep Learning topics. Good examples and exercises using industry-grade frameworks and libraries.</p><p>I dare say that, if you are really in a rush, you can skip everything I said before and just go for the book.</p><p>You will miss a good amount of information contained on the other resources mentioned, but the practical and actionable knowledge from Géron’s book is enough to work on many ideas for your next project.</p><p>If you feel limited after only reading the book, go back and study the rest of the material, it will fill in the gaps you might have and give you a more solid understanding.</p><h2>What about Framework X or Y?</h2><p>"Hey, I’ve heard about PyTorch and that other framework or library X everybody talks about".</p><p>As a Software Engineer, you know better than anyone how fast technology evolves.</p><p>Don’t go crazy for that, after you learn the basics in this guide, you can easily go, for instance, on <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> documentation or any other library or framework of sorts and learn how to use it in a week or two.</p><p>The techniques, the concepts, are all the same, it is only a matter of syntax and application or even tastes that you might have for any given tool.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To wrap it up, I want to say that, even though it might seem a lot, I tried to remove all the noise and at the end of the process, you will feel confident that you understand what is happening behind the curtains, the jargons and even be able to read some papers published in the field to keep up with the latest advances.</p><p>TL;DR Here is the list of resources mentioned in sequence:</p><ul><li><a href="https://renanmf.com/the-python-guide-for-beginners/">The Python Guide for Beginners</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a></li><li><a href="http://course18.fast.ai/ml">Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders</a></li><li><a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/">Deep Learning Specialization</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5697" role="main"><div><div><div><p>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20039-w" target="_blank">new study of almost 40,000 adults</a> has found that the brains of lonely people differ from those of people who are not lonely, in significant and detectable ways. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>This loneliness “signature” consists of variations in the volume of different brain regions, and the way those brain regions communicate. And these variations may be related to the typical thinking patterns of lonely people, which include for example higher than average amounts of reminiscence and imaginary conversations.</p><p>The study compared the MRI scans of people who said they “often” feel lonely with the scans of people do not report feeling that way. The data comes from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UK Biobank</a>, which is an open-source database containing genetic and health information from about half a million people in the UK.</p><p>The 38,701 participants consisted of 47.5% men and 52.5% women. Their ages ranged from 40 – 69, with an average age of 55. About 13% of them answered “yes” to the question “Do you often feel lonely?” Of those who answered yes, about 39% were men, and 61% women.</p><p>The new paper appeared today (December 15) in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a></em>.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><h2>Lonely people and the default network</h2><p>The researchers behind the study, from McGill University in Montreal, found that the key differences involved the brain’s “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network" target="_blank">default network</a>.” This network is responsible for a wide range of mental processes that take place when the brain is at rest. These processes are often referred to as the “inner voice”, or the “self.”</p><p>The default network plays a crucial role in memory, social cognition (i.e. thinking about other people), and mental time travel (“What will I do tomorrow?”). It involves the medial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex, along with a number of other structures. It is also responsible for hallucinations and internal imagery.</p><p>The researchers discovered, unexpectedly, that volumes in several of these default network regions were larger in lonely people. They also found equally unexpected patterns of positive associations between some of these regions.</p><h2>Feeling lonely: the typical thought patterns of lonely people</h2><p>The association between the default network and loneliness may be because of the way lonely people think. Lonely people have been found, for example, to focus more on internal thoughts, perhaps to compensate for their lack of actual social experiences. Their thought patterns tend to include above-average levels of reminiscing and imagined social exchanges. And this increase in thoughts about the self might well influence the relationship between the regions of the default network.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>“In the absence of desired social experiences,” the authors write, “lonely individuals may be biased towards internally directed cognitions,” as if “to fill the social void.”</p><p>In that sense, then, the physical effects of loneliness on the brain are not surprising. Paying “greater attention to one’s inner milieu, and a heightened focus on the self and self-reflective thoughts,” the authors write, “would naturally engage memory-based functions of the default network.”</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://amzn.to/3nnJzNk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">past research on loneliness</a> has found that lonely people are more likely to engage in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0022-3514.85.3.409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imaginary social interactions</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.2008.02194.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nostalgic reminiscences</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0033-295X.114.4.864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypothetical conversations</a>, and are also more likely to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.2008.02056.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treat pets like people</a>.</p><h2>So lonely: why studying loneliness matters</h2><p>Researchers are increasingly recognizing loneliness as a major health problem. A recent study, for example, found that <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/loneliness-among-older-americans-doubled-during-pandemic-poll-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loneliness has more than doubled among older people</a> since the Covid-19 pandemic began.</p><p>Past research has also shown that older people who experience loneliness have a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Lonely people get sick more often, and take longer to get over infections. Loneliness also increases blood pressure and levels of stress hormones. Socially isolated people are more likely to be depressed, suffer from memory loss, and use alcohol and drugs. Likewise, evidence suggests that loneliness contributes to ageing in a number of ways, and leads to reduced longevity. In fact, the health risks of loneliness are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614568352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equivalent to those related to obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day</a>.</p><p>Understanding how loneliness works in the brain could one day help prevent neurological disease, and lead to better treatments.</p><p>“We speculate that the associations between the default network and loneliness revealed here,” the researcher write, “reflect increased demands on episodic mental simulation of inner social events in the absence of desired social experience in the external world.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20039-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The default network of the human brain is associated with perceived social isolation</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Spreng et al.<br><strong>Published in:</strong> <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a></em><br><strong>Publication date: </strong>December 15, 2020<br><strong>DOI:</strong> http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20039-w<br><strong>Photo:</strong> by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@anthonytran?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Anthony Tran</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/the-psych-news-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly newsletter</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/2jee4tlakqo">Walkthrough and technical details</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’m pleased to finally have some results to show for a project I’ve been working on in my spare time for the last year or so.</p>

<p>The idea originated when I was trying to think of an interesting idea for a project to help me learn Verilog and FPGA design, and the notion of building a simple raytracer came to mind (partly inspired by a scarily smart friend of mine who is building his own GPU). A bit later - because sometimes my brain hates me and delights in coming up with silly things to do - this turned into “wouldn’t it be interesting to try making a SNES do raytracing?”, and thus the SuperRT chip idea was born.</p>

<p>What I wanted to try and do was something akin to the Super FX chip used in titles such as Star Fox, where the SNES runs the game logic and hands off a scene description to a chip in the cartridge to generate the visuals. To that end I’ve deliberately tried to restrict myself to just using a single custom chip for the design, not making use of the ARM core available on the DE10 board or any other external processing resources.</p>

<p>The end results look something like this:</p>

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apologies for the poor screenshot quality, incidentally - for some reason my capture card produces terrible results when capturing from my SNES, so I had to resort to the good old “photograph the screen in a darkened room” approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Hardware.jpg" alt="SuperRT development hardware"></p>

<p>The Super Nintendo (technically a Super Famicom) seen here has had the case removed to make room for the cabling, but other than that is totally unmodified. Attached to it is the PCB from a copy of an <em>awful</em> Pachinko game I picked up for 100 yen at a local second-hand store, with the game ROM removed and replaced with a cable breakout. This then passes through a set of level shifters to convert the SNES’s 5v down to 3.3v and then into a DE10-Nano FPGA development board with a Cyclone V FPGA. The level shifter boards are anything but pretty - and assembling them was a nightmare thanks to the necessary ICs only being available in surface-mount packages - but they do the job.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide3.jpg" alt="Hardware layout diagram"></p>

<p>The SuperRT chip constructs the scene using a specialised command language which is executed by one of three parallel execution units on the chip - essentially specialised CISC processors - to perform ray intersection tests. The scene description allows objects to be constructed using a subset of CSG operations, using spheres and planes as the basic building blocks and then performing OR, AND and subtraction operations using them to build up the desired geometry. AABBs are also supported, although primarily for use in culling tests (they can be rendered if desired, but they have a lower positional accuracy than other primitives and thus this is not generally very useful except for debugging purposes).</p>

 </video> 
</p>

<p>The renderer casts up to four rays per screen pixel, calculating direct shadows from a directional light source and a single reflection bounce. Surfaces each have a diffuse colour and reflectivity property, and it’s possible to apply modifiers to these based on CSG results or specialised functions - this is used to generate the checkerboard pattern on the floor.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide2.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>The ray colour for each pixel is calculated by a “ray engine”, which handles the overall ray lifecycle and uses an “execution engine” module to run the command program describing the scene as many times as is required to resolve the ray. The command program itself is uploaded from the SNES and stored in a local 4K RAM buffer - animation is performed by writing modified commands into this buffer as required. A disassembled command buffer looks like this:</p>

<p>Each execution engine is a processor module with a 14 cycle pipeline, and in general one instruction is retired per cycle, so each execution unit can calculate about 50 million sphere, plane or AABB intersections per second. The exception to this is that branch operations have to flush the entire pipeline and thus have a  16 cycle overhead (14 cycles to flush the pipeline + 2 cycles instruction fetch delay). To try and avoid this as much as possible a branch prediction system is used - fortunately a lot of the time the spatial coherency of nearby rays means that a high prediction hit rate is achievable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide5.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>Intersections in the execution engine are carried out by two pipelines, one handling AABBs and the other spheres and planes. The system as a whole works exclusively using 32-bit integer maths in 18.14 fixed point format, with 16-bit (2.14) format used where values are known to be in the +-1 range, and the sphere/plane intersection pipeline has two dedicated additional maths units that calculate reciprocal and square root operations.</p>

</p>

<p>Once a frame is rendered, the PPU converter module turns the framebuffer into a format that can be DMAed directly to the SNES VRAM for display, reducing it to 256 colours and swizzling it into character tile bitplanes. The screen resolution is 200x160 - this results in exactly 32000 bytes of image data for a full frame, which is transferred to VRAM in two 16000 bytes chunks over successive frames due to bandwidth constraints. Thus the full image can only be refreshed once every two frames, effectively limiting the maximum framerate to 30FPS - although the test scene runs at closer to 20FPS (primarily due to some bottlenecks with the logic on the SNES side at present).</p>

<p>Many thanks to the participants in <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=20068">this thread</a> over at SNESdev for a lot of useful ideas on fullscreen expansion chip DMA that inspired the solution used here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide4.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>The chip also implements a number of other basic functions - there is an interface to the SNES cartridge bus, along with a small program ROM holding 32K of code for the SNES (this is constrained by the fact that the interface board currently only connects up the SNES Address Bus A lines, and thus the effective usable address space is a mere 64K, of which 32K is used for memory-mapped IO registers to communicate with the SuperRT chip). There is also a multiplication accelerator unit that lets the SNES perform 16x16bit multiply operations rapidly.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Shot13.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>For debugging, I used the HDMI interface on the DE10 board to output data to a second monitor, along with a Megadrive joypad connected to the GPIO pins to manipulate the debug system. Resource constraints mean that this has to be disabled if all three ray engine cores are enabled, however.</p>

<p>So that’s a broad overview of the system - I intend to post some articles giving more details of how individual components work in the near future. In the meantime, though, if you have any questions or thoughts then please get in touch and I’ll do my best to answer!</p>

<p>Many thanks to Matt, Jaymin, Rick and everyone else who has helped with advice, inspiration and support!</p>

			<p> Web development has become a very complex field with many branches and tools to master. In this article, I suggest doing the inverse and use just a simple `index.html` file to manage all of the web app development scripts and assets. This might seem radical but does it make life more complex than using all those front-end tools we have become accustomed to? </p>

		<p>Using an <code>index.html</code> as the single management file for the app.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/html5-hammer.png" alt="HTML5 badge with a hammer, ready to do some damage" title="That is one big hammer!"></p>
<p><em>"It might work for small things, but I wouldn't use it for something big."</em>
Said someone about something.</p>
<p>These are some of the things that an <code>index.html</code> typically does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sets the title for the current page</li>
<li>Defines the content and assets</li>
<li>Defines content to be used as a template</li>
<li>Loads styles</li>
<li>Runs scripts and resolves modules dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Which are already quite good, but there are many more goodies to be found among the things that a simple <code>index.html</code> allows to do such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest">manifest file</a> for offline usage of the page items</li>
<li>Using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web API</a>'s on the scripts (navigation, web components, 3d, audio, network access, etc...)</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content">Preload</a> content and assets</li>
<li>Content <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication">syndication</a></li>
<li>Social networks <a href="https://ogp.me/">meta information</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, everything that any modern complex Web App does can be fit into a single <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
<p>It is mostly a matter of managing the complexity and growth of files, assets, components, etc...</p>
<p>We have developed a wide range of very complex tools to help us with that. Front-end development has become so complex that it is hard for any single person to master it.</p>
<p>How much harder would life be if a single <code>index.html</code> was used to drive all of the development instead of all those Create-React-App/Babel/WebPack/npm/yarn/d/sass/styled-components/optimizers? </p>
<p>I don't know how to answer this but will try to shed some light on a simpler, more "naked" approach for web app development.</p>
<p>To start <strong>there are at least two problems</strong> with using a single <code>index.html</code> as the only management file for the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>No TypeScript support (or any other transpiler language, only JS, GLSL, and WebASM supported)</li>
<li>No way to easily manage 3rd party dependencies dependencies (dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>These two will be the subject of my next post. For now, I am going to lay the ground for a simple <code>index.html</code>-only approach.</p>
<h2 id="a-common-structure-for-most-apps">A common structure for most apps</h2>
<p>The common structure I plan to follow is something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Page meta --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;link&gt;'s go here after the meta stuff --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;script type="module"&gt;'s go here --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt; </span><span>&lt;!-- Feature flags as class strings in body --&gt;
  &lt;!-- Modals go here --&gt;
  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
    </span><span>&lt;!-- The content being shown goes here --&gt;
  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  </span><span>&lt;!-- &lt;template&gt;'s go here --&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;script&gt;'s go here at the end --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>This structure makes some compromises but overall is enough for most complex apps. It is not that different from a normal HTML page 🧐.</p>
<p>JavaScript modules are being loaded at the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, which is ok because module scripts are deferred by default and do not block the parsing of the rest of the document. They could go anywhere, I prefer to keep the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> for the main logic and more immediate scripts.</p>
<p>With this in mind, here are 3 common things to a web app that can be done in such a simple structure without much effort:</p>
<ol>
<li>Global loading state (full-screen loading)</li>
<li>Routing (what to show according to the URL being rendered)</li>
<li>Place common HTML parts/assets without repeating them (templating/components)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="global-loading-page">Global Loading page</h2>
<p>A loading page that fills the whole screen is something that most web apps have, some even distract us with cool animations while loading.</p>
<p>In the above structure, the loading page goes into the modal area. Right before the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> content. This allows heavy content like <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> to be placed as <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> children and fully load (shaders, image data, etc) behind it, before clearing the loading state and showing them to our friends.</p>
<pre><code><span>...
&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>div </span><span>id</span><span>="</span><span>loading</span><span>"&gt;Loading&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>The whole visible space gets covered with that loading <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> which is then removed when all the things that the app needs for a good first run are ready.</p>
<p>Having the loading upfront on the <code>index.html</code> without needing any JS to first show it also helps our karma score in the bots&amp;spiders purgatory that purge the web we all love into useful cinder blocks.</p>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
<p>No lib is going to be used for routing. Routing is going to consist of simple manipulations of the browser history with <code>popstate</code> and <code>pushstate</code>. The basic approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the current route from the window location</li>
<li>Clone its corresponding <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> into the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag</li>
<li>Inside it adjust the relevant <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>'s and other link navigation tags to perform a <code>pushState</code> instead of their default behavior
<ul>
<li>Filters can be applied to only consider <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>'s that have relative paths, or that do not have the <code>rel=nofollow</code> attribute</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>onpopstate</code> clone the correspnoding <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> into the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag</li>
</ol>
<p>This is intended only for web apps as an effort to reduce the amount of JS and leverage the features already at hand. For anything similar to regular pages the browser behavior is more than good enough, no need for JS there.</p>
<p>This approach should work well if the web app uses less than 20 or 15 possible routing patterns. Most web apps likely average at some number under 10. This simple approach should be more than enough. There is no need in my foreseeable use cases to use anything more complex like the DOM or any big library to manage routes.</p>
<p>I will evolve this into a very simple routing/templating library to be announced soon(ish). For reference, here is some code that I did for a template engine in one of the many Grid iterations: <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/scripts/meander.js">old routing code</a>.</p>
<p>I appreciate the browser's approach of associating page state with history, however, for a web app I find it simpler and more manageable to keep these two things separate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Routing seen as pure functions of navigation only transformations</li>
<li>App state in its own separate tarpit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="html-templating">HTML Templating</h2>
<p>Stamping and repeating a common HTML structure in a couple of places is a frequent routine that most web apps do. Be it for menu entries, list items, or even whole parts like sidebars or modal and toast elements. Finding a common HTML structure and repeat it when needed with small adjustments is a stapled practice.</p>
<p>HTML templating has many technicalities and possibilities. Most JS frameworks commonly solve it in their own way with different degrees of justifiable complexity.</p>
<p>Web browsers already provide a very flexible and complex way to do templating through the Web Components suite of technologies. For most of my cases plain HTML will be prefered and written directly at that <code>index.html</code>. For the other cases where DRY speaks louder a simple static "copy/paste" tag will suffice, a small prototype of this could be something like:</p>
<pre><code><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>template-content</span><span>", </span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
  </span><span>constructor</span><span>() {
    </span><span>super</span><span>();
    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>attachShadow</span><span>({ mode: </span><span>"</span><span>open</span><span>" </span><span>})
        .</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(
          document.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(
            </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>from-id</span><span>'</span><span>)
          ).content.</span><span>cloneNode</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>))
  }
}</span><span>);
</span></code></pre>
<p>This small code defines a new WebComponent tag <code>&lt;template-content&gt;</code>, this tag reads an element id from its <code>from-id</code> attribute, then gets the corresponding element on the DOM for that id, clones it, and replaces itself with it.</p>
<p>This is useful because it provides a quick way to stamp HTML/SVG content on the document. Helpful to replicate SVG elements, lists, and node sub-trees on the client-side.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>nav</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;</span><span>button </span><span>onclick</span><span>="</span><span>tool</span><span>('</span><span>undo</span><span>')"&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-button-content</span><span>" /&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-undo</span><span>" /&gt;
	&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;</span><span>button </span><span>onclick</span><span>="</span><span>tool</span><span>('</span><span>draw</span><span>')"&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-button-content</span><span>" /&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-draw</span><span>" /&gt;
	&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>nav</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>template </span><span>id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-button-content</span><span>"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Some complex content here --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>template </span><span>id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-draw</span><span>"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Some other complex content here --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Keeping a single <code>index.html</code> might be just enough for a simpler naked approach to app development. If there is no need for big dependencies, versioning tracking files, transpilers, and all that, this could very well be good enough. It works directly on top of what browsers already provide and hints at a simpler, leaner, style of development.</p>
<p>It does not have TypeScript support and it also does not automatically resolve dependencies and bundles them.</p>
<p>These are two open problems with this approach that I plan to show a possible solution that is on par in simplicity with this one. That will be the subject of my next technical post (likely to come out next week). Stay tuned.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    

    <p>Recently the team I work with completed a project to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UyDK2bDjc4">allow Shopify to run in
multiple datacenters</a>. This project
was a refactoring project in disguise. When you undertake large refactoring of a
code-base with 100s of developers and 100,000s of lines of code, you can’t align
by sending an email. The merge-conflicts a single pull request would entail
makes me shiver. When deprecating in a large code-base the only way to reliably
avoid new deprecated behaviour is a failing test that tells you what to do.
Otherwise the pace that new deprecated code is introduced can easily outpace the
speed at which you can remove them, or be a massive source of frustration.</p>
<p>Typically deprecations come in the form of soft warnings: Logging to <code>stderr</code>,
capital letters and exclamation marks in the documentation, or a legacy prefix
to the method or class name. At the end of the day, everyone needs to get work
done, and if they see a code-path already being used from 10 places in the
code-base despite these soft warnings–it doesn’t seem crazy to introduce
another. However, if another project is blocked on these deprecated code-paths,
piling on may have a large cost.</p>
<p>To solve this problem <a href="https://twitter.com/fw1729">Florian Weingarten</a> on our
team introduced what he calls “shitlists”: a whitelist of deprecated behaviour.
Existing deprecated behaviour is OK and whitelisted. New usage of the deprecated
API is banned and fails a test with a well-defined error.</p>
<p>They come in many forms, but could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Shitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>ClassA</span>,
  <span>ClassB</span>,
  <span>ClassC</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>push_job_that_does_crazy_things</span>(klass)
  <span>if</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>.</span>include?(klass)
    <span># Existing deprecated behaviour is called.</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span>, <span>&lt;&lt;-EOS
</span><span></span><span>You</span><span>'</span>re pushing a job that does crazy things<span>.</span> <span>This</span> <span>API</span> has been 
deprecated <span>in</span> this code<span>-</span>base<span>.</span> <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;</span> is actively trying to get
rid of this code<span>-</span>path, because
<span>&lt;</span>reason<span>&gt;.</span> <span>We</span> suggest you instead <span>do</span> <span>&lt;</span>alternative<span>&gt;.</span> <span>If</span> you have questions, please
ping <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;.</span>
  <span>EOS</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A shitlist could be something as simple as a <code>git grep</code> for a certain code-path:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>test</span> <span>"no new introductions of legacy code path"</span> <span>do</span>
  actual <span>=</span> <span>`git grep some_legacy_method_with_a_unique_name`</span>
  assert_equal <span>321</span>, actual
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other times you can reach into another API and get a count or shitlist:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RedisShitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>Session</span>,
  <span>FragmentCache</span>,
  <span>AuthenticationTokens</span>,
<span>]</span>

<span>test</span> <span>"no new redis models introduced"</span> <span>do</span>
  assert_equal <span>RedisShitlist</span>, <span>RedisModel</span><span>.</span>descendants
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other ways we’ve used shitlists in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that a certain datastore is only read from in a certain context (or
not used at all). This would allow for using a read-only slave, or improving
resiliency in a certain area.</li>
<li>Ensure fallbacks for all uses of a secondary data-store. E.g. if you access
sessions in Redis and Redis is down, you should be able to still render the
page (i.e. have an empty session fallback).</li>
<li>Shitlisting joins between tables that have no business being joined. This is
helpful to keep data-models and scope clean, or separating a part of an
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a linter for a project, you may be able to encode rules. For example
you might use <a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/">Foodcritic</a> for Chef, or
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby.</p>
<p>Sometimes the shitlist is quite complicated, and much more domain-specific.</p>
<p>Building the shitlist gives the team responsible for it a number of advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong feedback loop.</strong> The goal is to reduce the <code>Shitlist</code> to an empty
Array and always raise or remove the code entirely. Remove a class from the
list, fix the code and the tests, celebrate and move on.</li>
<li><strong>Stopped the bleeding.</strong> New deprecated behaviour is not introduced unless
the team is contacted or some other action defined in the error is taken.</li>
<li><strong>Success metric</strong>. If you have shitlists for everything that needs to be
done for your project, you have metrics that you can track. Every week you
can look at how these lists are shrinking. Refactoring for months at a time
can be exhausting, but if you see that you’re making progress with metrics
moving, it’s much more rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Enforces a guarantee</strong>. For example, you can have a shitlist that all jobs
have a retry mechanism. In that case, you know that you can kill any worker
gracefully at any time since the job will retry. Because of 1-3 you know how
much work it will take to have this guarantee.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that the shitlist errors are actionable. If you hit the shitlist
of another team, you need to know what to do next. Ideally the error explains
exactly what you need to do, and no humans need to talk, but reaching out to the
owner of the shitlist should always be part of the shitlist.</p>
<p>If you own a shitlist, you must empathize with the problems of everyone who’s
running into problems. If you simply deprecate new behaviour and don’t offer an
alternative, you will be the source of frustration. If the value of emptying the
shitlist far outweighs the value of adding to the shitlist, it may be OK to not
offer a direct other solution but ask the person who ran into the error to
revise their solution.</p>
<p>It is important that people run into shitlists as early in development as
possible. If you run into a shitlist after spending hours implementing your
solution, you will be less than popular. Some shitlists may require an entire
re-architecting of some teams’ solutions.</p>
<p>Months, in our case more than a year, of refactoring can be overwhelming and
unrewarding work. With the strong feedback loop that shitlists introduce you can
see the light at the end of the tunnel. You know that nothing is added to the
shitlist without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>Creating shitlists in some cases can be extremely difficult. Some take hours to
create, others weeks, and in our case one took months to come up with. You’ll
have to place the cost of developing the shitlist against the cost of not having
it. In some cases logging when you hit a bad code-path may be enough (simple
soft warning deprecation) if you assert the risk of new behaviour small and the
complexity of introducing the shitlist big.</p>
<p>Delegating with shitlists is great. Due to the tight feedback loop, asking other
teams or onboarding new team members becomes much easier. Remove something on
the shitlist, fix the code and the tests, then move on. Sometimes during large
refactorings you may need other teams with more domain expertise of a certain
area of the code-base to help. The shitlist becomes a great rock to point people
at.</p>
<p>If you are about to embark on a large refactor, I highly recommend adding

<p>Bash scripts. Almost anyone needs to write one sooner or later. Almost no one says “yeah, I love writing them”. And that’s why almost everyone is putting low attention while writing them.</p>



<p>I won’t try to make you a Bash expert (since I’m not a one either), but I will show you a minimal template that will make your scripts safer. You don’t need to thank me, your future self will thank you.</p>



<h2><span id="why_scripting_in_bash"></span>Why scripting in Bash?<span></span></h2>



<p>The best summary of Bash scripting appeared recently on my Twitter feed:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The opposite of "it's like riding a bike" is "it's like programming in bash".</p><p>A phrase which means that no matter how many times you do something, you will have to re-learn it every single time.</p></div>— Jake Wharton (@JakeWharton) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/1334177665356587008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But Bash has something in common with another widely beloved language. Just like JavaScript, it won’t go away easily. While we can hope that Bash won’t become the main language for literally everything, it’s always somewhere near.</p>



<p>Bash <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Bash-considered-the-lingua-franca-of-shells/answer/Paul-Reiber">inherited the shell throne</a> and can be found on almost every Linux, including Docker images. And this is the environment in which most of the backend runs. So if you need to script the server application startup, a CI/CD step, or integration test run, Bash is there for you.</p>



<p>To glue few commands together, pass output from one to another, and just start some executable, Bash is the easiest and most native solution. While it makes perfect sense to write bigger, more complicated scripts in other languages, you can’t expect to have Python, Ruby, fish, or whatever another interpreter you believe is the best, available everywhere. And you probably should think twice and then once more before adding it to some prod server, Docker image, or CI environment.</p>



<p>Yet Bash is far from perfect. The syntax is a nightmare. Error handling is difficult. There are landmines everywhere. And we have to deal with it.</p>



<h2><span id="bash_script_template"></span>Bash script template<span></span></h2>



<p>Without further ado, here it is.</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -Eeuo pipefail
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)

usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

Available options:

-h, --help      Print this help and exit
-v, --verbose   Print script debug info
-f, --flag      Some flag description
-p, --param     Some param description
EOF
  exit
}

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}

setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}

die() {
  local msg=$1
  local code=${2-1} # default exit status 1
  msg "$msg"
  exit "$code"
}

parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # example named parameter
      param="${2-}"
      shift
      ;;
    -?*) die "Unknown option: $1" ;;
    *) break ;;
    esac
    shift
  done

  args=("$@")

  # check required params and arguments
  [[ -z "${param-}" ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing required parameter: param"
  [[ ${#args[@]} -eq 0 ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing script arguments"

  return 0
}

parse_params "$@"
setup_colors

# script logic here

msg "${RED}Read parameters:${NOFORMAT}"
msg "- flag: ${flag}"
msg "- param: ${param}"
msg "- arguments: ${args[*]-}"</code></pre>



<p>The idea was to not make it too long. I don’t want to scroll 500 lines to the script logic. At the same time, I want some strong foundations for any script. But Bash is not making this easy, lacking any form of dependencies management.</p>



<p>One solution would be to have a separate script with all the boilerplate and utility functions and execute it at the beginning. The downside would be to have to always attach this second file everywhere, losing the “simple Bash script” idea along the way. So I decided to put in the template only what I consider to be a minimum to keep it possible short.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at it in more detail.</p>



<h3><span id="choose_bash"></span>Choose Bash<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code></pre>



<p>Script traditionally starts with a shebang. For the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21612980/why-is-usr-bin-env-bash-superior-to-bin-bash">best compatibility</a>, it references <code>/usr/bin/env</code>, not the <code>/bin/bash</code> directly. Although, if you read comments in the linked StackOverflow question, even this can fail sometimes.</p>



<h3><span id="fail_fast"></span>Fail fast<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code></pre>



<p>The <code>set</code> command changes script execution options. For example, <strong>normally Bash does not care if some command failed</strong>, returning a non-zero exit status code. It just happily jumps to the next one. Now consider this little script:</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
cp important_file ./backups/
rm important_file</code></pre>



<p>What will happen, if the <code>backups</code> directory does not exist? Exactly, you will get an error message in the console, but before you will be able to react, the file will be already removed by the second command.</p>



<p>For details on what options exactly <code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code> changes and how they will protect you, I refer you to the <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">article I have in my bookmarks for a few years now</a>.</p>



<p>Although you should know that there are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/g1vsxk/the_first_two_statements_of_your_bash_script/fniifmk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">arguments against setting those options</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="get_the_location"></span>Get the location<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)</code></pre>



<p>This line <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/2512304">does its best</a> to define the script’s location directory<s>, and then we <code>cd</code> to it. Why?</s></p>



<p>Often our scripts are operating on paths relative to the script location, copying files and executing commands, assuming the script directory is also a working directory. And it is, as long as we execute the script from its directory.</p>



<p>But if, let’s say, our CI config executes script like this:</p>



<pre><code>/opt/ci/project/script.sh</code></pre>



<p>then our script is operating not in project dir, but some completely different workdir of our CI tool. We can fix it, by going to the directory before executing the script:</p>



<pre><code>cd /opt/ci/project &amp;&amp; ./script.sh</code></pre>



<p>But it’s much nicer to solve this on the script side. So, if the script reads some file or executes another program from the same directory, call it like this:</p>



<pre><code>cat "$script_dir/my_file"</code></pre>



<p>At the same time, the script does not change the workdir location. If the script is executed from some other directory and the user provides a relative path to some file, we will still be able to read it.</p>



<h3><span id="try_to_clean_up"></span>Try to clean up<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}</code></pre>



<p>Think about the <code>trap</code> like of a <code>finally</code> block for the script. At the end of the script – normal, caused by an error or an external signal – the <code>cleanup()</code> function will be executed. This is a place where you can, for example, try to remove all temporary files created by the script.</p>



<p>Just remember that the <code>cleanup()</code> can be called not only at the end but as well having the script done any part of the work. Not necessarily all the resources you try to cleanup will exist.</p>



<h3><span id="display_helpful_help"></span>Display helpful help<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

...
EOF
  exit
}</code></pre>



<p>Having the <code>usage()</code> relatively close to the top of the script, it will act in two ways:</p>



<ul><li>to <strong>display help</strong> for someone who does not know all the options and does not want to go over the whole script to discover them,</li><li>as a <strong>minimal documentation</strong> when someone modifies the script (for example you, 2 weeks later, not even remembering writing it in the first place).</li></ul>



<p>I don’t argue to document every function here. But a short, nice script usage message is a required minimum.</p>



<h3><span id="print_nice_messages"></span>Print nice messages<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}</code></pre>



<p>Firstly, remove the <code>setup_colors()</code> function if you don’t want to use colors in text anyway. I keep it because I know I would use colors more often if I wouldn’t have to google codes for them every time.</p>



<p>Secondly, those <strong>colors are meant to be used with the <code>msg()</code> function only</strong>, not with the <code>echo</code> command.</p>



<p>The <strong><code>msg()</code> function is meant to be used to print everything that is not a script output</strong>. This includes all logs and messages, not only the errors. Citing the great <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> article:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>In short: stdout is for output, stderr is for messaging.</strong></p><cite><a href="https://jdxcode.com/">Jeff Dickey</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/oclif/oclif/graphs/contributors">knows a little</a> about <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli/graphs/contributors">building CLI apps</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>That’s why in most cases you shouldn’t use colors for <code>stdout</code> anyway.</p>



<p>Messages printed with <code>msg()</code> are sent to <code>stderr</code> stream and support special sequences, like colors. And colors are disabled anyway if the <code>stderr</code> output is not an interactive terminal or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://no-color.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the standard parameters</a>&nbsp;is passed.</p>



<p>Usage:</p>



<pre><code>msg "This is a ${RED}very important${NOFORMAT} message, but not a script output value!"</code></pre>



<p>To check how it behaves when the <code>stderr</code> is not an interactive terminal, add a line like above to the script. Then execute it redirecting <code>stderr</code> to <code>stdout</code> and piping it to <code>cat</code>. Pipe operation makes the output no longer being sent directly to the terminal, but to the next command, so the colors should be disabled now.</p>



<pre><code>$ ./test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat
This is a very important message, but not a script output value!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="parse_any_parameters"></span>Parse any parameters<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # …</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://mypy-lang.org/" rel="noopener">Mypy</a> is an optional static type checker for Python. It's been around since 2012 and is gaining traction even since. One of the main benefits of using a type checker is getting errors at "compile time" rather than at run time.</p>
<p>Exhaustiveness checking is a common feature of type checkers, and a very useful one! In this article I'm going to show you <strong>how you can get mypy to perform exhaustiveness checking!</strong></p>

<h2 id="exhaustiveness-checking"><a href="#exhaustiveness-checking">Exhaustiveness Checking</a></h2>
<p>Say you have a system to manage orders. To represent the status of an order, you have the following enum:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span><span>.</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Ready</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ready'</span>
    <span>Shipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shipped'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You also have the following code to process an <code>Order</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When the order is ready, you ship it; and when it's shipped, you charge it.</p>
<p>A few months go by and your system becomes big. So big in fact, that you can no longer ship orders immediately, and you add a new status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span><span>.</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Ready</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ready'</span>
<span>    <span>Scheduled</span> <span>=</span> <span>'scheduled'</span>
</span>    <span>Shipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shipped'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you push this change to production, you run a quick check with mypy to make sure everything is OK:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Mypy does not see anything wrong in this code, Do you? The problem is that <strong>you forgot to handle the new status in your function</strong>.</p>
<p>One way to make sure you always handle all possible order statuses is to add an assert, or throw an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled status "{status}"'</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, when you execute the function with the new status <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>, you will get a runtime error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>)</span>
<span>AssertionError</span><span>:</span> <span>Unhandled</span> <span>status</span> <span>"OrderStatus.Scheduled"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Another way to with deal with cases like this is to go over your test suite and add scenarios in all the places that use order status. But... if you forgot to change the function when you added the status, what are the chances you'll remember to update the tests? That's not a good solution...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking in Mypy</strong></p>
<p>What if mypy could warn you at "compile time" about such cases? Well... it can, using this little magic function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>NoReturn</span>
<span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>def</span> <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled value: {value} ({type(value).__name__})'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you dig into the implementation, try to use it to see how it works. In the function above, place <code>assert_never</code> after you handled all the possible order statuses, where you previously used <code>assert</code> or raises an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, check the code with Mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal[OrderStatus.Scheduled]"</span><span>;</span>
expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
Found <span>1</span> error in <span>1</span> file <span>(</span>checked <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file<span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Amazing! <strong>Mypy warns you about a status you forgot to handle!</strong> The message also includes the value, <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>. If you use a modern editor such as VSCode you can get these warnings immediately as you type:</p>
<figure><img alt="mypy Error in VSCode" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-python-mypy-exhaustive-checking.png"><figcaption>mypy Error in VSCode</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can now go ahead and fix your function to handle the missing status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Pending</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'schedule order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>
</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check with mypy again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Great! You can now rest assure you handled all order statuses. The best part is that you did that with <strong>no unit tests</strong>, and there were <strong>no runtime errors</strong>. If you include mypy in your CI, the <strong>bad code will never make it into production</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="enumeration-types"><a href="#enumeration-types">Enumeration types</a></h2>
<p>In the previous section you used mypy to perform exhaustiveness check on an <code>Enum</code>. You can use mypy, and <code>assert_never</code> to perform exhaustiveness check on other enumeration types as well.</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Union</strong></p>
<p>A <code>Union</code> type represents several possible types. For example, a function that casts an argument to <code>float</code> can look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Union</span>
</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>Union</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check the function with mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"float"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Whoops... you forgot to handle the <code>float</code> type in the code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Union</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>Union</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>elif</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>):</span>
</span><span>        <span>return</span> <span>num</span>
</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Great! mypy is happy...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Literal</strong></p>
<p>Another useful type is <code>Literal</code>. It is included in the built-in <code>typing</code> module since Python3.8, and prior to that it is part of the complementary <a href="https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/" rel="noopener"><code>typing_extensions</code> package</a>.</p>
<p>A <code>Literal</code> is used to type primitive values such as strings and numbers. <code>Literal</code> is also an enumeration type, so you can use exhaustiveness checking on it as well:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing_extensions</span> <span>import</span> <span>Literal</span>

<span>Color</span> <span>=</span> <span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'R'</span><span>,</span> <span>'G'</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_color_name</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>Color</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'R'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Red'</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'G'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Green'</span>
    <span># elif color == 'B':</span>
    <span>#     return 'Blue'</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Checking the code without the commented part will produce the following error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal['B']"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Very handy indeed!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="type-narrowing-in-mypy"><a href="#type-narrowing-in-mypy">Type Narrowing in Mypy</a></h2>
<p>Now that you've seen what <code>assert_never</code> can do, you can try and understand how it works. <code>assert_never</code> works alongside <strong>"type narrowing"</strong>, which is a mypy feature where the type of a variable is narrowed based on the control flow of the program. In other words, mypy is gradually eliminating possible types for a variable.</p>
<p>First, it's important to understand how various things translate to a <code>Union</code> type in mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[int, None]</span>

<span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'string'</span><span>,</span> <span>42</span><span>,</span> <span>True</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[Literal['string'], Literal[42], Literal[True]]</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Suit</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Clubs</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♣"</span>
    <span>Diamonds</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♦"</span>
    <span>Hearts</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♥"</span>
    <span>Spades</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♠"</span>

<span>Suit</span>
<span># ~Equivalent to Union[</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Clubs],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Diamonds],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Hearts],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Spades]</span>
<span># ]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To display the type of an expression, mypy provides a useful utility called <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#reveal-type" rel="noopener"><code>reveal_type</code></a>. Using <code>reveal_type</code> you can ask mypy to show you the inferred type for a variable at the point it's called:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span># Revealed type is Union[Suit, None]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the function above, the reveled type of <code>suit</code> is <code>Union[Suit, None]</code>, which is the type of the argument <code>suit</code>.</p>
<p>At this point you haven't done anything in the function, so mypy is unable to narrow down the type. Next, add some logic and see how mypy narrows down the type of the variable <code>suit</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>
</span><span>    <span># Revealed type is Suit</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After eliminating the option of suit being <code>None</code>, the revealed type is <code>Suit</code>. Mypy used your program's logic to narrow the type of the variable.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the type <code>Suit</code> is equivalent to the type <code>Union[Literal[Suit.Clubs], Literal[Suit.Diamonds], Literal[Suit.Hearts], Literal[Suit.Spades]]</code>, so next, try to narrow down the type even more:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

<span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After checking if <code>suit</code> is <code>Suit.Clubs</code>, mypy is able to narrow down the type to <code>Suit.Clubs</code>. Mypy is also smart enough to understand that if the condition does not hold, the variable <em>is definitely not</em> <code>Clubs</code>, and narrows down the type to <code>Diamonds</code>, <code>Hearts</code> or <code>Spades</code>.</p>
<p>Mypy can also use other conditional statements to further narrow the type, for example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span># `and`, `or` and `not` also work.</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Diamonds</span> <span>or</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Spades</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Diamonds or Spades"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Hearts]</span>
</span><span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>By the end of the function, mypy narrowed down the type of <code>suit</code> to <code>Suit.Hearts</code>. If, for example, you add a condition that imply a different type for <code>suit</code>, mypy will issue an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>

    <span># `and`, `or` and `not` also work.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Diamonds</span> <span>or</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Spades</span><span>:</span>

<p>In the early summer of 2018, Norway received an unusual request from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's government.</p><p>Saudi Arabia wanted to send ten men on an official assignment to Norway, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms to Dagbladet. The ten men were all security guards, who were deployed to work at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Norway, according to Dagbladet’s sources.

<h2>The crucial points</h2><p>• <strong>The number:</strong> The number of security guards was unusually high. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly publishes a list of all foreign diplomats accredited to Norway. According to the diplomat list from the summer of 2018, the total number of Saudi diplomats in Norway at the time was 18. Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that the Saudis were about to almost double the number - with only security people.</p>
<p>• <strong>The status:</strong> Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that Saudi Arabia requested that the security guards be granted diplomatic status - and registered in the official <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/ud/dep/forbindelser/id447053/">Diplomat List</a>. It is unusual for security people at embassies to be registered as diplomats. Both diplomats and other embassy personell - arriving on a so-called «D-visa» to Norway - is given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>. Which, as one of several benefits, means that the host country cannot arrest you if you commit a crime. But being registered formally as a diplomat gives you a wider range of benefits.</p><p>• <strong>The increase:</strong> Norwegian authorities reacted to the fact that the major increase in security staff did not reflect what they knew regarding the activity level at the embassy.</p><p>• <strong>The key role:</strong> Officials at PST have later noted that security personnel, from the consulate in Istanbul, played key roles in the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Dagbladet has learned.</p>
<p><strong>The PST declined to comment on this article, however, it has been presented with all the information herein – without finding any errors.</strong></p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>Guri Solberg, spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirms in an e-mail to Dagbladet:</p><p>“In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs registered ten persons as new envoys at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Oslo. The status of other countries' envoys to embassies is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and the role of the envoy at the embassy. As these were mainly persons who were to have internal tasks at the embassy, nine of the ten persons were registered as administrative / technical personnel in accordance with normal practice. One of the ten people was registered as a diplomat based on their role and responsibilities. In practice, there is little difference in the degree of immunity and privileges granted to diplomatic, administrative, and technical personnel. The rules on immunity and privileges are dictated by international law by which Norway is bound, in particular the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations, that includes immunity from criminal prosecution in the host state.”</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>The men arrived in Norway at the end of July 2018. The one security guard who received the diplomatic status Saudi Arabia requested, now works as Head of Security at the Saudi Arabian embassy, according to Dagbladet's sources. He is formally listed in the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic list as an "attaché".</p><div>

<p>“It was a discussion. There are regulations for the type of status that the embassies' security people can hold whilst staying in Norway. They are not diplomats”, a source familiar with the case tells Dagbladet.</p><div id="factbox-73180109" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="1">
    <h2>Facts: Diplomatic immunity in Norway</h2>
        
    
        <p>According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, all envoys from other countries have diplomatic immunity when they are working for their country’s embassy. This applies to both diplomats and administrative personnel, such as security staff. <br></p><p>However, different degrees of immunity are granted, according to the rank of the individual within the system. Only diplomats have full immunity. <br></p><p>Neither diplomats nor security staff at embassies can be prosecuted or subjected to taxation in Norway. Security staff (administrative personnel) do not, however, have immunity from civil proceedings arising from their conduct in private. Whilst diplomats can import as much as they desire tax-free for private use, administrative personnel are only exempt from customs duties on entry to a country. <br></p><p>Norway can sanction an envoy with diplomatic immunity by declaring them persona non grata in Norway.</p><p><em>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs</em></p>

<p>If you travel by sea to the Frognerstranda harbour, at times you can spot the Kingdom's characteristic green flag - with a white sabre, and the inscription "There is no god without Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet" - waving over the hedge. From a magnificent villa, designed in 1899 by the famed Norwegian architect Ingvar Hjorth, Saudi Arabia manages its activities in Norway.</p>
<p>Dagbladet has asked the Embassy in Oslo why they requested the security guards be granted diplomatic immunity, about the points Norway reacted to, about the Embassy’s relationship with the activist Iyad el-Baghdadi, and about why the Embassy wanted to increase the number of security guards by so many.</p><p><strong>The Embassy has declined to meet with Dagbladet, preferring to respond by email, with a press release originally sent out in 2019:</strong></p><p>"The Embassy is informed about what has been circulated in some media in regard to Mr. Iyad el-Baghdadi and the allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Embassy would like to clarify that this person is not a Saudi citizen and is unknown to the Kingdom. What he said is fabricated and false and aims to offend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We have been in contact with the Norwegian Government to provide the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with further information in this regard. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reserves the right to take the necessary legal measures against the mentioned-above in order to safeguard its rights."</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em> <em>Dagbladet received the following statement on Thursday 17th of December:</em></p><p><em>«The Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reiterates what was released in 2019, and denies any previous knowledge or existing relationship between the Kingdom and Iyad el-baghdadi.</em></p><p><em>In regards to the issue concerning the security guards, these guards are positioned at the embassy to provide the necessary protection, around the clock, for both the Embassy building and the Head of Mission’s residence. Saudi embassies in several countries have received threats and have been targeted by terrorist attacks - the most recent of which being the incident at the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in The Hague.»</em></p><h2>Briefed by the PST</h2><p>In a spartan apartment in Oslo, Dagbladet meets Iyad el-Baghdadi.</p><div id="parallax-73159998">

<p>Here is my personal list of legally free Python books. <strong>Warning: Packt free books are highly unreliable, what can be free today can no longer be free tomorrow They were included as they are free at the time of writing this post. Similarly is Oreilly’s case. The two publishing houses have been annotated as necessary.</strong> In case of no longer free or broken links please mail me at `arj.python at gmail dot com` to update article. I have to thank the internet who took the pain to point these resources to me. I have skimmed through the contents to producs a list of legally free Python books of value. Here’s how i evaluated books (you might not agree, but that’s my personal take on it):</p>




<p>Some popular listed books like Python Module of the Week  is not a book and Tango with Django 1.7 is outdated.  Materials which provide only some free chapters are not free books. Docs manuals are docs manuals, you’d have to include a quarter of pypi’s packages manuals then. github projects are gihub projects unless it’s a book. Mark pilgrim ran away so should we from his book. We don’t want some illegal 100+ free list (Mark Lutz books are not free mind you), you could include all Python books hosted on drive then. Python2 is past, we passed over. Fullstackpython’s list is a collection of various sites’ articles, not a book. Really short books more qualified as leaflets did not make it. Such materials have been deliberately left out. What remains are books that you’ll enjoy!</p><p>

<p> Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid </p>



<p> Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, there is a lack of documentation on what to learn after getting the basics of Python down your throat. Through this book I aim to solve this problem. I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore. The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like this when I was beginning to learn Python. If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book. Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given.  A true example of legally free Python books. </p>



<h3><a href="http://ralsina.gitlab.io/boxes-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boxes: Your Second Python Book</a></h3>



<p>Roberto Alcina</p>



<p>This book tries to achieve only one thing: Show you a project go from&nbsp;<strong>nothing</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. By nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No goals, no commitments. Just a vague interest. And by OK I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to use, it will be&nbsp;<strong>useful</strong>&nbsp;and be a real thing. Think of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only instead of rockers there is a single overweight Argentinian dev, and instead of a band there is a piece of software. So, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.</p>



<h3><a href="https://learnpythonbreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Python, Break Python</a></h3>



<p>Scott Grant</p>



<p>Learn Python, Break Python is a hands-on introduction to the Python programming language, written for people who have no experience with programming whatsoever. Hey, we all have to start somewhere. As such, the examples and teaching style used in this text make absolutely no expectations about your prior programming experience. Anyone can pick up the art of programming with a little time and a bit of patience. However, when learning something new, I try to break things. In fact, in many cases, I go out of my way to break stuff. When picking up a new concept like computer programming, you can actually increase your comfort level by figuring out the type of cases that are likely to break. You’ll see what data can be used and where, and when you inevitably run into errors later (like everyone does), you won’t be surprised.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/PyBook/swan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorithmic Problem Solving with Python</a> </h3>



<p> John B. Schneider, Shira Lynn Broschat, Jess Dahmen </p>



<p>(Not an algo book) Python’s syntax and idioms are much easier to learn than those of most other full-featured languages. This book uses programming language Python to introduce folks to programming and algorithmic thinking. </p>



<h3> <a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/python-guide/latest/python-guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.</a></h3>



<p>Kenneth Reitz</p>



<p> This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.slitherintopython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slither Into Python</a></h3>



<p> Slither into Python is an introduction to Python for complete beginners. No prior programming experience or computer science background is necessary. Unlike any other Python resources I have found (not that they’re not out there), they don’t explain important computer science concepts such as memory or “how computers work”. In this book I will cover the fundamentals of the Python language and also introduce these important concepts. Put simply,&nbsp;<em>coding</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>computer programming</em>&nbsp;is about making computers do what you want, Computer Science is about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;computers do it. Each go hand-in-hand, help you learn faster and improve your overall understanding of a language! This book aims to do exactly that through Python. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a></h3>



<p>Jake VanderPlas – Oreilly</p>



<p>The book provides a whirlwind tour of some of Python’s essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language. My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack just outlined. </p>



<h3><a href="https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python For You and Me</a></h3>



<p>Kushal Das (Core Dev)</p>



<p> A book for the total new comers into Python world. Was started as book for students before they read Python tutorial. Given it’s from a core dev, even up to chapter choice order is insightful.</p>



<h3> <a href="https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python for Astronomers </a></h3>



<p> Imad Pasha, Christopher Agostino </p>



<p> This text is designed to be an introduction to the Python programming language — which is now used nearly ubiquitously in astronomy — with applications to the types of tasks an undergraduate (or beginning graduate student) might have to tackle. It is not, in any way, meant to be comprehensive; my focus is on bringing you up to speed as efficiently and quickly as possible. This text might have useful information for those with a working knowledge of Python outside of a research setting, but is primarily designed for those with no prior programming experience. By the end of this text, I hope to have shared enough to make you feel comfortable taking the first steps into research-type problems (of which this book will contain several examples), whether in an astronomy course, a research internship, or on-campus research. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><p>Nexus is a library originally authored by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/tgriesser">Tim Griesser</a> that allows developers to build code-first and type-safe GraphQL APIs. Prisma has been a core contributor to the library for over two years and has helped shape its evolution.</p><p>Today, we're happy to announce that we've released Nexus 1.0.</p><p>This release is the culmination of outstanding community feedback and contributions, years of battle-testing Nexus in production, and responding to lessons learned in creating an excellent developer experience for those building GraphQL APIs.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Prisma's products are no longer GraphQL-centric. You can use Prisma in a REST API, a GraphQL API, or in any other setting where you want to access a database in Node or Go. Although we contribute to Nexus, it is not necessary to use it alongside Prisma. <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Find out more</a> about what Prisma offers and how to use it.</p><h2 id="what-is-nexus"><a href="#what-is-nexus" aria-label="what is nexus permalink"></a>What is Nexus?</h2><p>Nexus offers a way to build code-first GraphQL APIs in Node. The code-first approach to building a GraphQL API is in contrast to the (potentially more common) schema-first approach.</p><p>Most developers that are new to building GraphQL APIs start out by taking the schema-first approach that has been popularized by companies like Apollo and their Apollo Server offering.</p><p>With the schema-first approach, writing the GraphQL API requires a set of <strong>type definitions</strong> and accompanying <strong>resolvers</strong>. A simple schema-first server might look like this:</p><pre><code>type Post <span>{</span>
  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
type Query <span>{</span>
  <span>posts</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>]</span><span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span>const</span> Query <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  posts<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      id<span>:</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span>
      title<span>:</span> <span>'My first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
      body<span>:</span> <span>'How I wrote my first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>While the schema-first approach is easy to get started with, it comes with some inherent drawbacks that can make development difficult when applications start getting bigger.</p><p>Nexus takes a different approach to building GraphQL APIs. Instead of keeping a separate schema and set of resolvers, with Nexus, schemas and resolvers are written in the same spot using code.</p><p>Refactoring the Post example above to Nexus would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> objectType<span>,</span> queryType<span>,</span> makeSchema <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

<span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

</code></pre><p>There are numerous benefits to taking a code-first approach with Nexus, including:</p><ul><li>Schema and resolver co-location</li><li>SDL and type generation</li><li>No need for extra tooling</li></ul><h3 id="schema-and-resolver-co-location"><a href="#schema-and-resolver-co-location" aria-label="schema and resolver co location permalink"></a>Schema and Resolver Co-location</h3><p>When building a schema-first GraphQL API, it is common to start out by placing all type definitions and resolvers in a single file. When both the schema and the resolvers live next to one another, it's fairly straightforward to work in both at the same time.</p><p>As the application grows, however, it is most often desired to move parts of the schema into their own separate modules and files. It's at this point that working on a GraphQL API becomes a bit more tedious. With this modularization comes the need to switch back and forth between the Schema Definition Language and JavaScript/TypeScript to write the resolvers. Not only does one need to constantly switch between files, they also need to do a context switch mentally to work between the two langauges.</p><p>With Nexus, our schema and its resolvers are always defined together. Nexus also allows us to write everything in a common language. This allows us to side-step the co-location/context switching issue altogether and helps us to be more productive, even as our applications grow to be quite large.</p><h3 id="automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation"><a href="#automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation" aria-label="automatic type and schema definition language generation permalink"></a>Automatic Type and Schema Definition Language Generation</h3><p>One major benefit of using Nexus is its ability to automatically generate TypeScript types and GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) files. The generated types are useful for adding extra type safety to the code used to power your GraphQL API. The generated SDL files can be used for many purposes. For example, we can configure our editors to know about the shape of our APIs to give us introspection for the queries and mutations we write.</p><p>Type and SDL generation comes for free with Nexus and can be enabled by supplying some configuration in the <code>makeSchema</code> call.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> path <span>from</span> <span>'path'</span>
<span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> <span>makeSchema</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

</code></pre><h3 id="changes-to-nullability"><a href="#changes-to-nullability" aria-label="changes to nullability permalink"></a>Changes to Nullability</h3><p>In previous versions of Nexus, fields were treated as non-nullable by default. This differed from other GraphQL API frameworks which would treat fields as nullable unless otherwise specified. The Nexus authors took this approach because allowing fields to be non-nullable by default posed some long-term risks for API development.</p><p>The default nullability for fields has now been inverted in Nexus so that we can align with GraphQL best practices and expectations, specifically from the authors of GraphQL.</p><p>At Nexus 1.0, you need to explicitly make fields non-null:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>'Post'</span><span>,</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>The code for the <code>Post</code> object type above uses a property called <code>nonNull</code> which offers a bit more flexibility for specifying that fields should be non-null. It's useful for situations where the chaining API is not ideal, such as expressing deeply-nested types and when programmatically creating non-nullable types.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> queryType<span>,</span> stringArg<span>,</span> nonNull <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>The <code>nonNull</code> function accepts an argument which can be used to specify the type for a type or argument.</p><p>While fields are now nullable by default, it's possible to change this behavior either globally or at the type level in your Nexus API.</p><div><pre><code><span>queryType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

<p>In the fall of 2018, we noticed that there was something that set Google apart from other big tech companies. Everybody was talking about how to regulate these tech companies, and everybody had pretty good plans for how to do it — for every company besides Google. In our opinion, it was because nobody really seemed to understand what Google does, or how they do it. So, for the past two years, we’ve been researching and analyzing Google. Through this work, we’ve found some really compelling evidence about what powers Google’s monopoly, so much so that <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/2020/10/07/we-crawled-our-way-into-the-big-tech-antitrust-report/">Congress referenced this work as part of their recently released Big Tech Antitrust Report</a>. The big ideas that we have is that that crawling the web is a natural monopoly, that Google has control of that monopoly, and that once you understand why this is true and what it means it becomes pretty clear about what sorts of regulations should be taken to reign in Google’s power over the internet. </p>
<p>We have published on this website the economic arguments that we have developed that we think help people understand the foundations of Google and how to regulate<a href="https://knuckleheads.club/understanding-google/"> </a>them. Up until now we have done all this work in private, reaching out to and meeting with regulators on an individual basis. With the publishing of an article about this work in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/how-google-dominates.html">The New York Times</a>, we are publishing this research for everyone to read and opening up the club for people to join and participate in researching Google’s monopoly. We have a <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/whats-next/" data-type="page" data-id="2518">solid plan for the next year</a> about how to finish this research and work with legislators and governments to get legislation drafted and introduced to regulate Google’s web crawling advantages. If you find yourself agreeing with what you read on this website and get caught up imagining a better future where the internet isn’t just five big tech companies all cutting deals with each other, please consider <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/join-the-club/" data-type="page" data-id="2444">joining the Knuckleheads’ Club</a> and helping us fight to win a better world. </p>
<p>So, with all that said as an introduction, let’s dive into what Google is exactly. </p>

		<p>Well the news is out, I won’t explain the method for reasons, but our code warriors have a new fight. After requesting the SU password, they were told flat out it doesn’t exist and referred to the manual by the vendor. Taking that argument to the telco ombudsman got the same response. If there were one and you wanted to change it for security reasons, it looks like you can’t and with the vendors denying it’s existance, there’s no help coming.</p>

<p>Few events are as compelling as an epidemic. When sufficiently severe, an epidemic evokes responses from every sector of society, laying bare&nbsp;social and economic fault lines and presenting politicians with fraught medical and moral choices. In the most extreme cases, an epidemic can foment a full-blown political crisis. Thus,&nbsp;Thucydides describes how the repeated visitations of plague to Athens in 430-426 BC&nbsp;provoked widespread social disorder and the breakdown of civic norms.</p>



<p>‘Men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred or profane,’ writes Thucydides. ‘All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset and… many had recourse to the most shameless sepulchres.’</p>



<p>As the plague progresses, Thucydides describes how Athenians were swept up in a wave of hedonism and lawlessness, threatening the foundations of Athenian democracy: ‘Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner… fear of gods or law of man there was none to restrain them.’</p>



<p>The resulting crisis, Thucydides claimed, undermined Athenians’ faith in the rule of law and the democratic principles that underpinned the Greek city state, paving the way for the installation of a Spartan oligarchy known as the Thirty Tyrants. Even though the Spartans were later ejected, Athens never regained its confidence.</p>



<p>Covid-19 appears to have engendered a similar crisis in our world, the main difference being in scale. Whereas the crisis Thucydides describes was confined to Athens, the coronavirus pandemic has destabilized governments from Brazil to Belarus,&nbsp;not just that of a 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century city-state. The political reckoning has been particularly rapid in the United States, where Donald Trump’s inability or unwillingness to check the spread of the coronavirus was a key factor in his recent election defeat. Now, the lockdowns and social distancing measures look set&nbsp;to&nbsp;plunge the world into the worst economic depression since the 1930s, raising the spectre of further political instability.</p>



<p>Given the wide-ranging&nbsp;social, economic and political impacts of Covid-19, it is natural to assume that the same must have been true of past epidemics and pandemics. But is this the case? Do pandemics really have the historical impacts that are often claimed for them or are these claims simply the product of particular narratives and readings of history? &nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in&nbsp;numerical terms, the most devastating pandemic of all time was the 1918-19 ‘Spanish influenza’. Coinciding with the end of the First World War, the Spanish flu is estimated to have killed between fifty to one hundred million people worldwide. However, while 1919 was the first year since records began that the death rate exceeded the birth rate, those that survived generally enjoyed longer and healthier lifespans and, in many instances, benefited from higher wages too. Moreover, while the global death toll was immense, in developed industrial countries the mortality rate averaged two percent, meaning the Spanish flu left most of society unaffected. Indeed, the Spanish flu appears to have made little impression on public memory and social institutions, hence its historiographical characterisation as the&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/why-historians-ignored-the-spanish-flu-101950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘forgotten pandemic’.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-narrating-epidemic-crises">Narrating Epidemic Crises</h2>



<p>A crisis is normally conceived of as an isolated moment in time in which our lives are shattered and plunged into disorder – what the cultural anthropologist Hendrik Vigh has called&nbsp;‘a momentary malformation in the flow of things’.&nbsp;Vigh <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141840801927509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observes that</a> for many people crises are ‘endemic rather than episodic’ and cannot be delineated as an aberrant moment of chaos or a period of decisive change.&nbsp;This is particularly the case for those living at the margins of society for whom crises are ever present. Indeed, social critics such as Naomi Klein argue that instability is baked into the capitalist system, hence the way that&nbsp;in the last few decades<strong>&nbsp;</strong>neoliberal societies have lurched from one financial crisis to another.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, crises have long been regarded as a way of accessing deeper historical truths. As Janet Roitman <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/330/Anti-Crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has argued</a> in&nbsp;<em>Anti-Crisis</em>&nbsp;(2013), a crisis ‘marks and generates history’. This is particularly the case for epidemics and pandemics which, unlike other natural disasters such as famines, are not limited to a particular region or moment in time but may come to encompass the whole globe. As the medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40144420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">puts it</a>, disease outbreaks involve a ‘radically different ontological order’, a mode of being that is simultaneously ‘pathological and infectious’. Or to put it another way, one could conceivably outrun a famine but those who try to flee a plague may become unwitting carriers, contaminating new communities and introducing the pathogen to new places.</p>



<p>What is also not widely appreciated is that the roots of the term ‘crisis’ lie in the Ancient Greek word&nbsp;<em>krinô</em>&nbsp;(meaning to separate, choose, cut, decide, judge) and can be traced back to Hippocrates, whose scientific method influenced Thucydides’ approach to history. For the Hippocratic school of medicine, prognosis took precedence over diagnosis, the point being to identify the turning point of a disease in order to intervene and bring about a satisfactory resolution to the illness. Similarly, Thucydides hoped that by tracking the social and moral dissolution that envelopes Athens under the strain of the plague, his history could serve as a ‘great case-book of social pathology’, enabling readers to recognise similar historical patterns in future and intervene so as to restore order and stability. In this way, <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-invention-of-medicine/robin-lane-fox/9780241277058#:~:text=Robin%20Lane%20Fox's%20remarkable%20book,that%20survive%20under%20his%20name." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has been argued</a>, Thucydides applied a medical template to epidemic crises that has coloured our interpretation of them ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-death-and-demographic-change">The Black Death and demographic change</h2>



<p>Perhaps the standout example of the transformative power of disease is the fourteenth century Black Death. Caused by the plague bacillus,&nbsp;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>, the pandemic coincided with the transition from medieval to early modern European society and was greatly enhanced by new shipping networks linking Venice and Genoa with Constantinople, Tunis, London and Bruges. The larger broad-bellied ships required for these long voyages provided perfect conveyances for plague-carrying rats and were soon sparking outbreaks across Europe.</p>



<p>Some scholars claim the pandemic killed a third of Europe’s then population between 1347 and 1353; others say up to one half. Whatever the true mortality there is little doubt the Black Death represented a massive external shock to medieval society and, together with the famines that preceded it, contributed to a declining or stagnant population in Europe for almost 150 years afterwards. The result was a demographic, economic and political crisis.</p>



<p>A smaller population meant less demand for grain putting downward pressure on the price of basic foodstuffs. At the same time, a diminished population fuelled competition, exerting upward pressure on wages and challenging the villeinage system of forced labour that underpinned the feudal system. The result was a wave of popular uprisings across Europe, including the Jacquerie in France in 1358, the revolt of the Florentine&nbsp;<em>Ciompi</em>&nbsp;or wool carders in 1378-82, and the 1381 Peasants’ Revolt in England. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The demands of English peasants included the abolition of an inequitable poll tax and the removal of a statute, passed in the wake of the Black Death, that sought to restrict wages to pre-pandemic levels. The Florentine carders meanwhile demanded a more equitable fiscal policy and the right to establish guilds, fore runners of trade unions. Today, we take collective wage bargaining and trade unions for granted, but in the fourteenth century these demands threatened the basis of the feudal system, hence the observation of the French chronicler Jean Froissart that: ‘Never was any land or realm in such great danger as England at that time.’</p>



<p>This economic levelling also spurred a series of social and cultural changes, including the right of everyone except the lowliest manual worker to wear furs – a privilege that previously had been the preserve of nobles and clerics.&nbsp;In most cases the political reforms were short-lived. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126561.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wat Tyler</a>, the leader of the English rebels, marched to London to petition King Richard II with 60,000 peasants at his back. Demanding that ‘all men should be free and of one condition’, the rebels occupied the Tower of London, ransacked the palaces and mansions of wealthy Londoners, and executed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chief Justice, as well as other hated representatives of the nobility. Within a few weeks Wat Tyler and other leaders of the revolt had been arrested and executed and the crisis was over. Nonetheless, the movement resulted in concessions to peasants: the poll tax was abandoned, and wage bargaining expanded over time, leading to the emergence of a new yeoman class.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-collapse-of-the-aztec-and-incan-empires">The collapse of the Aztec and Incan empires</h2>



<p>Similar claims&nbsp;have been made about the crisis that enveloped the Aztec and Incan empires following the Spanish Conquest of Central and South America in the early sixteenth century. In&nbsp;<em>Plagues and Peoples</em>, McNeill&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plagues-People-William-McNeill/dp/0385121229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that</a>&nbsp;‘disaster is to be expected whenever some previously remote and isolated tribe comes into contact with the outside world and there encounters a series of destructive and demoralizing epidemics.’</p>



<p>In the case of the Aztecs and Inca, the&nbsp;root cause of crisis and societal collapse&nbsp;was the introduction by Columbus and, later, the conquistador Hernan Cortez, of smallpox, measles and other Old World diseases to which Amerindian populations of modern-day Mexico, Guatemala and Peru had little or no immunity. The result was that&nbsp;within a century of Cortes’s arrival in the Gulf of Mexico in 1518 the population of Central Mexico had been reduced, according to some estimates, from 25 million to 1.5 million. A similar demographic …</p></div></div></div>

so that once it's built for the first time, we don't need to rebuild it any more. The integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> will be broken
when the assumption does not hold.</p><p>In this release, we fix the integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> which allows user to change the dependencies.
The fix is well implementend that people who don't do such modifications will not pay for it.</p><p>This is one of the highest desired feature request based on the
<a href="https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/4361#issuecomment-739538789" rel="noopener noreferrer">user feedback</a>, so we will expand a bit here why it is tricky
to implement it without compromising performance.</p><p>In ReScript compilation scheme, dependencies as packages are treated as a blackbox,
changes of dependencies should be <em>transitive</em>. The is due to that we have cross module
optimizations and the binary interface itself is a hash of its dependencies.
So for a package dependency chain: A -&gt; B -&gt; C, if A changes and B does not change, C still needs get rebuilt.
Because the intermediate output of B may still change due to the change of A.
To make things worse, each package comes with an installation process which is a shell script, so re-installation will make the
package look like freshly built.</p><p>In this release, we track the installation in the build graph as well, and we calculate the hash of the installation of dependencies and put it in the
dependent's command line flags for building binary artifacts. Such strategy benefits in such aspects: </p><ul><li><p>The calculation of the hash of installation is almost free since it is just one stat, we don't need track all dependencies' artifacts.</p></li><li><p>The introducion of such hashing does not appear in parsing, so that the changes of dependencies will never trigger re-parsing.</p></li><li><p>Once the package installation is a nop, the transitive rebuild graph will be cut off so that we can save some unneeded rebuild.</p></li><li><p>When people make changes to the depdendencies, if such changes don't change the package interface, it will not trigger the build of its dependents.</p></li></ul><h3>Introducing <code>pinned-dependencies</code><span><span><a href="#introducing-pinned-dependencies"><svg height="0.8em" width="0.8em" viewBox="0 0 20.003 19.944"><path d="M11.927 7.908a4.819 4.819 0 00-3.968-1.3 5.091 5.091 0 00-2.921 1.508L1.47 11.684a4.82 4.82 0 00.192 7.122 4.994 4.994 0 006.76-.4l3.7-3.776a.109.109 0 00-.067-.184s-.649.029-1.132.006a10.116 10.116 0 01-1.35-.226.308.308 0 00-.243.088l-2.529 2.609a2.733 2.733 0 01-3.583.319 2.64 2.64 0 01-.247-3.951l3.755-3.753a2.7 2.7 0 013.654-.073.108.108 0 00.15 0l1.4-1.4a.114.114 0 00-.003-.157z"></path><path d="M8.076 12.036a4.822 4.822 0 003.967 1.3 5.089 5.089 0 002.922-1.509l3.568-3.568a4.818 4.818 0 00-.192-7.121 5 5 0 00-6.761.4l-3.7 3.777a.108.108 0 00.067.183s.648-.028 1.132-.006a10.151 10.151 0 011.35.226.3.3 0 00.243-.088l2.529-2.608a2.732 2.732 0 013.581-.319 2.638 2.638 0 01.249 3.95l-3.755 3.754a2.706 2.706 0 01-3.654.073.107.107 0 00-.15 0l-1.4 1.4a.113.113 0 00.004.156z"></path></svg></a><a id="introducing-pinned-dependencies"></a></span></span></h3><p>To make <code>bsb -make-world</code> more pratical, we also introduce a new concept called: <code>pinned-dependencies</code>.

such package will be built mostly like <code>toplevel</code> packages. </p><p>The usage is quite simple, add <code>pinned-dependencies</code> in the toplevel package's <code>bsconfig.json</code>.

<p><em>As companies increasingly leverage data to power digital products, drive decision making, and fuel innovation, understanding the health and reliability of these most critical assets is fundamental. For decades, organizations have relied on data catalogs to power data governance. But is that enough?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debashis1saha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Debashis Saha</em></a><em>, VP, Engineering at AppZen, formerly at eBay and Intuit, and </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrmoses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Barr Moses</em></a><em>, CEO and Co-founder of Monte Carlo, discuss why data catalogs aren’t meeting the needs of the modern data stack, and how a new approach – data discovery – is needed to better facilitate metadata management and data reliability.</em> </p>



<p><em><strong>Interested in learning more about Monte Carlo’s approach to data catalogs and metadata management? <a aria-label="Request a demo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://marketing417822.typeform.com/to/D11gk1a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Request a demo</a>.</strong></em></p>



<p>It’s no secret: knowing where your data lives and who has access to it is fundamental to understanding its impact on your business. In fact, when it comes to building <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-like-a-product/">a successful data platform</a>, it’s critical that your data is both organized and centralized, while also easily discoverable.</p>



<p>Analogous to a physical library catalog, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data catalogs</a> serve as an inventory of metadata and give users the information necessary to evaluate data accessibility, health, and location. In our age of <a href="https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/self-service-business-intelligence-BI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-service business intelligence</a>, data catalogs have also emerged as a powerful tool for data management and data governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, for most data leaders, one of their first imperatives is to build a data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the bare minimum, a data catalog should answer:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Where should I look for my data?&nbsp;</li><li>Does this data matter?&nbsp;</li><li>What does this data represent?</li><li>Is this data relevant and important?&nbsp;</li><li>How can I use this data?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Still, as data operations mature and data pipelines become increasingly complex, traditional data catalogs often fall short of meeting these requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s why some of the best data engineering teams are innovating their approach to metadata management – and what they’re doing instead:</p>



<h3>Where data catalogs fall short</h3>



<p>While data catalogs have the ability to document data, the fundamental challenge of allowing users to “discover” and glean meaningful, real-time insights about the health of your data has largely remained unsolved.</p>



<p>Data catalogs as we know them are unable to keep pace with this new reality for three primary reasons: (1) lack of automation, (2) inability to scale with the growth and diversity of your data stack, and (3) their undistributed format.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Increased need for automation</h4>



<p>Traditional data catalogs and governance methodologies typically rely on data teams to do the heavy lifting of manual data entry, holding them responsible for updating the catalog as data assets evolve. This approach is not only time-intensive, but requires significant manual toil that could otherwise be automated, freeing time up for data engineers and analysts to focus on projects that actually move the needle.</p>



<p>As a data professional, understanding the state of your data is a constant battle and speaks to the need for greater, more customized automation. Perhaps this scenario rings a bell:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before stakeholder meetings, do you often find yourself frantically pinging Slack channels to figure out what data sets feed a specific report or model you are using – and why on earth the data stopped arriving last week? To cope with this, do you and your team huddle together in a room and start whiteboarding all of the various connections upstream and downstream for a specific key report?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll spare you the gory details, but it probably looked something like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ph5m59aRfL8owiafVZisgcTG1f0-zrOXWZObUv243HS9i3Gb1uSXXEv9bWOmROiTV8cL2GhNivW5hk8P9SQG3v6NploRM15l7f9s5R6xfbIBxAjPvHCLteV65jQqhhOcT8aXDD0Z" alt="" width="800" height="497"><figcaption><em>Does your data lineage look like a storm of lines and arrows? That makes two (hundred) of us. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock</a>.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If this hits home, you’re not alone. Many companies that need to solve this dependency jigsaw puzzle embark on a multi-year process to manually map out all their data assets. Some are able to dedicate resources to build short-term hacks or even in-house tools that allow them to search and explore their data. Even if it gets you to the end goal, this poses a heavy burden on the data organization, costing your data engineering team time and money that could have been spent on other things, like product development or actually using the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Ability to scale as data changes</h4>



<p>Data catalogs work well when data is structured, but in 2020, that’s not always the case. As machine-generated data increases and companies invest in ML initiatives, unstructured data is becoming more and more common, accounting for <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3406806/ai-unleashes-the-power-of-unstructured-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 90 percent of all new data produced</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-choosing-a-cloud-data-warehouse-3de66862f41c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typically stored in data lakes</a>, unstructured data does not have a predefined model and must go through multiple transformations to be usable and useful. Unstructured data is very dynamic, with its shape, source, and meaning changing all the time as it goes through various phases of processing, including transformation, modeling, and aggregation. What we do with this unstructured data (i.e., transform, model, aggregate, and visualize it), makes it much more difficult to catalog in its “desired state.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, rather than simply <em>describing</em> the data that consumers access and use, there’s a growing need to also <em>understand</em> the data based on its intention and purpose. How a producer of data might describe an asset would be very different from how a consumer of this data understands its function, and even between one consumer of data to another there might be a vast difference in terms of understanding the meaning ascribed to the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, a data set pulled from Salesforce has a completely different meaning to a data engineer than it would to someone on the sales team. While the engineer would understand what “DW_7_V3” means, the sales team would be scratching their heads, trying to determine if said data set correlated to their “Revenue Forecasts 2021” dashboard in Salesforce. And the list goes on.</p>



<p>Static data descriptions are limited by nature. In 2021, we must accept and adapt to these new and evolving dynamics to truly understand the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Data is distributed; catalogs are not&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Despite the distribution of the modern data architecture (see: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up-210710bb41e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data mesh</a>) and the move towards embracing semi-structured and unstructured data as the norm, most data catalogs still treat data like a one-dimensional entity. As data is aggregated and transformed, it flows through different elements of the data stack, making it nearly impossible to document.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png" alt="" width="623" height="482" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png 623w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"><figcaption><em>Traditional data catalogs manage metadata (data about your data) at the ingest state, but data is constantly changing, making it hard to understand the health of your data as it evolves in the pipeline. Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Nowadays, data tends to be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/self-describing-messages#:~:text=A%20message%20that%20contains%20data,consists%20of%20tag%2Fvalue%20pairs." target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-describing</a>, containing both the data and the metadata that describes the format and meaning of that data in a single package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since traditional data catalogs are not distributed, it’s near to impossible to use as a central source of truth about your data. This problem will only grow as data becomes more accessible to a wider variety of users, from BI analysts to operations teams, and the pipelines powering ML, operations, and analytics become increasingly complex.</p>



<p>A modern data catalog needs to federate the meaning of data across these domains. Data teams need to be able to understand how these data domains relate to each other and what aspects of the aggregate view are important. They need a centralized way to answer these distributed questions as a whole – in other words, a distributed, federated data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in the right approach to building a data catalog from the outset will allow you to build a better data platform that helps your team democratize and easily explore data, allowing you to keep tabs on important data assets and harness their full potential.</p>



<h3>Data Catalog 2.0 = Data Discovery</h3>



<p>Data catalogs work well when you have rigid models, but as data pipelines grow increasingly complex and unstructured data becomes the golden standard, our understanding of this data (what it does, who uses it, how it’s used, etc.) does not reflect reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that next generation catalogs will have the capabilities to learn, understand, and infer the data, enabling users to leverage its insights in a self-service manner. But how do we get there?&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png" alt="" width="624" height="486" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png 624w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"><figcaption><em>Data discovery can replace the modern data catalog by providing distributed, real-time insights about data across different domains, all while abiding by a central set of governance standards.&nbsp;</em> Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In addition to cataloging data, metadata and data management strategies must also incorporate data discovery, a new approach to understanding the health of your distributed data assets in real-time. Borrowing from the distributed domain-oriented architecture proposed by Zhamak Deghani and Thoughtworks’ <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>data mesh model</strong>,</a> data discovery posits that different data owners are held accountable for their data as products, as well as for facilitating communication between distributed data across different locations. Once data has been served to and transformed by a given domain, the domain data owners can leverage the data for their operational or analytic needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data discovery replaces the need for a data catalog by providing a domain-specific, dynamic understanding of your data based on how it’s being ingested, stored, aggregated, and used by a set of specific consumers. As with a data catalog, governance standards and tooling are federated across these domains (allowing for greater accessibility and interoperability), but unlike a data catalog, data discovery surfaces a real-time understanding of the data’s current state as opposed to it’s ideal or “cataloged” state.</p>



<p>Data discovery can answer these questions not just for the data’s ideal state but for the current state of the data across each domain:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The price of bitcoin is headed back over $19,000 again. What will it take to push it past $20,000—more tethers? More institutional buying? Or maybe, more crypto journalists proclaiming (without evidence) that tethers are fully backed? Here’s the news: </p>



<h2>MicroStrategy wants more, more, more</h2>



<p>Michael Saylor, the new crazy god of bitcoin institutional buying, continues his bitcoin buying spree. He seems really, really confident the price of BTC will go up. </p>



<p>Saylor’s publicly traded company MicroStrategy currently owns 40,824 bitcoins—because no sense using all that excess cash for buying back a ton of stock or paying a big dividend. Better off to gamble it on crypto. </p>



<p>Now the firm is actually going into debt to buy bitcoin. After completing a $650 million bond offering, MicroStrategy plans to plow all the proceeds into buying more bitcoin.

<p>Citibank isn’t impressed. Analyst Tyler Radke downgraded MicroStrategy (MSTR) from neutral to sell, calling the recent rally—MSTR went up after its first few BTC buying announcements—”overextended” and a possibly “deal-breaker” for software investors.

<h2>Tether: Ain’t no stopping us now</h2>



<p>Tether is now at <a href="https://archive.is/wip/aITvG">$20 billion worth of tether</a>—that’s assets, but circulating supply is soon to follow—and there is no evidence whatsoever to conclude that there is $20 billion in real cash behind all those tethers.&nbsp;Why? Because the company has never had a formal audit. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, last month, The Block’s Larry Cermak <a href="https://twitter.com/ahcastor/status/1338273950078398465">defended tethers</a> as being “either fully backed or very, very close,” telling folks “everything is in order now.” He based that on conversations he claimed to have had with “third-parties” who told him they had successfully redeemed several hundred million in tethers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cermak is not the only one to buy the Tether line of B.S. </p>



<p>In December 2018, after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/crypto-mystery-clues-suggest-tether-has-the-billions-it-promised">looking at Tether bank statements</a>, Bloomberg’s Matt Leising also reported that Tether appeared to be fully backed. He was wrong.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to him at the time, in the previous two months, the DOJ froze five NY bank accounts <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/02/the-us-government-wants-man-at-the-center-of-massive-cryptocurrency-scheme-held-without-bail/">belonging to Reginald Fowler</a>, who ran a shadow banking service for Tether/Bitfinex’s Panamanian payment processor. And in November, the NYAG, having serious concerns about Tether’s finances, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company">issued subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether</a> asking for details on their banking. Finally, in April 2019, Tether admitted it was only <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents">74% backed</a>. And that’s before it went off and printed another 17.5 billion tethers. So what’s backing all those?  </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/12/13/tether-is-too-big-to-fail-the-entire-crypto-industry-utterly-depends-on-it/">blog post</a>, David Gerard explains why Tether is “too big to fail.” Essentially, it’s keeping the entire BTC market afloat. If Tether were to get the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a>, the price of bitcoin is unlikely to ever recover. </p>



<p>Thus, “the purpose of the crypto industry, and all its little service sub-industries, is to generate a narrative—so as to maintain and enhance the flow of actual dollars from suckers, and keep the party going,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>NYAG: Tether documents forthcoming</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, there’s been a new document filing in the NYAG Tether probe.<a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG"> </a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">letter</a> to the Supreme Court, NYAG says Bitfinex/Tether are cooperating on document production and the parties expect to finalize things “in the coming weeks.” These documents, of course, consist of everything NYAG asked for in its original November 2018 subpoena—information that will shed light on the Tether and Bitfinex’s shadowy dealings since 2015. </p>



<p>A part of me wants to get excited about this news, but another part says, wait a minute. In the past when Tether’s operators said they were going to hand documents over, they simply handed over material that was already public information. They also have a <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/">long history</a> of shenanigans, so let’s just wait and see.  </p>



<h2><strong>How to turn USDT into cash&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Jorge Stolfi, a computer scientist from Brazil, shared on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/kbf5jj/yes_here_we_are_holy_shit_weve_done_it_our_boi/gfmqa1o/">Reddit</a> a “mainstream theory” on what could be happening behind-the-scenes at Tether—specifically, how Tether’s operators could convert USDT into cash for their own personal use. Remember, this is totally unproven. It is just a theory. (The “triad,” by the way, refers to Tether CSO Phil Potter, CEO and <a href="https://archive.is/DfBMP">man of mystery</a>&nbsp;J.L. van der Velde,&nbsp;and CFO Giancarlo Devasini. They are the same operators behind sister company Bitfinex.)</p>



<p>He writes:</p>



<ol><li>The owners of Tether Inc (which I will call “the Triad”) print billions of USDT without any backing.</li><li>The Triad deposits those USDT into Bitfinex (which they own too).</li><li>The Triad uses those USDT to buy BTC and other cryptos from other Bitfinex clients, attracted by the better price.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the BTC to their private wallets.</li><li>The Triad moves all or some of those BTC to other exchanges that handle real currencies, such as USD, EUR, JPY, etc.</li><li>The Triad sells those BTC for real money.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the real money into their personal bank accounts.</li></ol>



<p>This is a theory. This is not proven. But the point is, when you have no checks and balances in place along with massive loopholes in oversight, <em>anything</em> can happen. We <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/02/12/how-the-hell-did-we-get-here-a-timeline-of-quadrigacx-events/">saw this</a> already with QuadrigaCX—the Canadian crypto exchange that went bankrupt after the founder disappeared (aka “died in India”), taking along with him hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds.  </p>



<h2>Coinbase loses half critical security team</h2>



<p>After NYT reporter Nathaniel Popper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html">reported</a> about discriminatory complaints at Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1336072433091059712">new information came out</a>. Among those who recently resigned to protest the exchange’s new internal policies, were four of the seven people on Coinbase’s critical security team—aka the “key management team.” </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>New detail on how the turmoil at Coinbase has hit the company's efforts to secure its Bitcoins.</p><p>Among the people who resigned this fall – to protest new internal policies – were 4 of the 7 people on the most critical security team, the "key management team," sources told me.</p></div>— Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1336072433091059712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The key management team is responsible for securing the cryptographic keys to Coinbase’s cold wallets, where the majority of the company’s crypto is held—somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 billion. </p>



<p>“No job is more fundamental to the company’s success,” Popper said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase’s security chief <a href="https://twitter.com/SecurityGuyPhil/status/1336082099376287745">shot back</a>, saying Coinbase’s security team is managed by several teams with redundancy built in. Of course, he wants us to believe everything is fine, but not everyone is convinced. </p>

<h2>MassMutual invests in BTC</h2>



<p>Bitcoin has a new institutional investor: MassMutual. The Springfield-Mass insurance firm purchased $100 million worth of BTC for its general investment account, which totals $235 billion. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massmutual-joins-the-bitcoin-club-with-100-million-purchase-11607626800">WSJ</a>)</p>



<p>MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through NYDIG, a New York-based fund management company, which has  $2.3 billion worth of crypto under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG.</p>



<p>The $100 million cash injection into bitcoin sounds like a lot, but it’s small potatoes. That money will cover the network’s operators—the bitcoin miners—for only six days. Remember, bitcoin miners are selling their 900 newly minted bitcoin per day for $17 million, at current BTC prices. Investors will never see that money again. Bitcoin doesn’t make any real profits on its own—just investor money going in one end, out the other. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been writing JSON-REST APIs in Python for a number of years, and over that time I've found the tooling has greatly improved. To show you how you can benefit I'm going to show you how I've evolved. However, if you want to skip to the tooling I use today take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-schema">Quart-Schema</a>.</p> <p>Writing JSON-REST APIs in Python using Flask/Quart has always been pleasent. Yet communicating the API structure (routes, data, etc) to third parties and to my future self has not been. It is also difficult to guarantee that the API works as the documentation says it does. This has resulted in isses, bugs and misuse, in production I'd love to have avoided.</p> <p>I think I would have avoided these if the APIs I wrote,</p> <ul> <li>ensured that any data received or sent matched the communicated structure,</li> <li>communicated their structure using standardised documentation, specifically <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>,</li> <li>were setup such that linting checks informed me if I made any mistakes,</li> <li>took less effort to write (whilst acheiving these aims).</li> </ul> <h2 id="initial-flask-setup">Initial Flask setup</h2> <p>This is a simple example of how I used to write a Flask APIs,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which works very nicely, but meet none of my aims. Both myself and third party user would have to read the code to understand what is sent and returned by the API.</p> <p>It also does not help to know when the wrong data has been sent. For example <code>due</code> should be a date but if it isn't the <code>create_todo</code> function will raise a <code>ValueError</code> resulting in the API returning a 500 response. It should return a 400 response so that the third party and I can tell that it is an error with the data rather than a server or programming issue.</p> <h2 id="flask-with-docstrings">Flask with docstrings</h2> <p>In an attempt to solve the documentation problem experienced with the simple Flask setup I tried the <a href="https://sphinxcontrib-httpdomain.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">sphinx autohttp extensions</a>,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    <span>"""Create a TODO task.

    .. :quickref: Create a TODO.

    :reqheader Accept: application/json
    :&lt;json string task: task description
    :&lt;json string due: todo due date
    :&gt;json int id: todo unique identifier
    :&gt;json string task: task description
    :&gt;json string due: todo due date
    :resheader Content-Type: application/json
    :status 201: post created
    """</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which enables documentation to be created by manually specifying the data structures in the docstring.</p> <p>Whilst this helps with the documentation it has the same issues as the simpler Flask example, in that it doesn't validate the data sent to the route, nor the data returned. It also doesn't help with any linters, for example a simple typo like <code>data["duo"]</code> would only raise an error during testing, or worse in production.</p> <p>The bigger issue though, is writing the docstring documentation as it is time consuming, boring work that I (and my colleagues) would forget to do. Over time this lead to the documentation being wrong leading to distrust and lack of use.</p> <p>I eventually stopped using this technique and reverted to the simpler example as this documentation ended up actively misleading. It also became clear that the winning documentation standard was OpenAPI, rather than sphinx documentation.</p> <h2 id="aside-switch-to-quart">Aside switch to Quart</h2> <p>It was around this time in that I switched from writing APIs in Flask to writing them in <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart">Quart</a>. The snippets onwards in this article will now assume Quart, but the only difference is the use of async/await keywords, you can remove them to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <p>I wrote Quart as I wanted to start using the <code>async</code> <code>await</code> keywords and libraries. You can remove <code>async</code>, <code>await</code> from the examples to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <h2 id="jsonschema-decorators">JSONSchema decorators</h2> <p>The data sent and received in the APIs I write is formatted as JSON. This means a <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSONSchema</a> could be used to describe the structure and used to validate that any data matches it. This allows me to write decorators that accept JSONSchemas to validate request and response data,</p> <pre><code><span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> wraps

It is however just as painful to write as the sphinx docstrings (although now it cannot be ignored). It also doesn't help linters understand what we are doing with the data.</p> <h2 id="dataclass-decorators">Dataclass decorators</h2> <p>To gain help from the linting tools the data needs to be defined in a structure they understand. Conveniently Python 3.7 shipped dataclasses which we can use to define the structure and will enable IDEs and linters to alert me of any issues. By altering the decorator to <a href="https://github.com/s-knibbs/dataclasses-jsonschema">convert</a> the dataclass to a JSONSchema allows a dataclass to be used instead,</p> <pre><code><span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>TodoData</span>:</span>
    due: date
    task: <span>str</span>

<span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>Todo</span>(<span>TodoData</span>):</span>
    <span>id</span>: <span>int</span>

<span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span>@validate_request(TodoData)</span>
<span>@validate_response(Todo, 201)</span>
<span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>index</span>() -&gt; Todo:</span>
    data = <span>await</span> request.get_json()
    todo_data = TodoData(**data)
    todo_id = create_todo(todo_data.task, todo_data.due)
    <span>return</span> Todo(<span>id</span>=todo_id, task=todo_data.task, due=todo_data.due), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which is actually quite pleasant code to write and actually makes it quicker (with the IDE autocompletion) than any of the previous examples.</p> <p>I have been experimenting with the code to make the dataclass decorators work for a while, and it isn't the easiest. Thankfully I recently came across <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/dataclasses/">pydantic's dataclasses</a> which validate the arguments, and can generate schemas for documentation.</p> <h2 id="quart-schema-conclusion-">Quart-Schema (Conclusion)</h2> <p><a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-schema">Quart-Schema</a> is a Quart extension that provides the validation decorators and auto-generated documentation.

<p>Some time ago, I wrote a blog post about how <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/24/pointers-and-bytes.html">there’s more to a pointer than meets the eye</a>.
One key point I was trying to make is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal in the sense that they can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “extra information” that distinguishes different pointers to the same address is typically called <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#pointer-provenance"><em>provenance</em></a>.
This post is another attempt to convince you that provenance is “real”, by telling a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when provenance is not considered sufficiently carefully in an optimizing compiler.
The post is self-contained; I am not assuming that you have read the first one.
There is also a larger message here about how we could prevent such issues from coming up in the future by spending more effort on the specification of compiler IRs.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>Below, I will show a series of three compiler transformations that each seem “intuitively justified”, but when taken together they lead to a clearly incorrect result.
I will use LLVM for these examples, but the goal is not to pick on LLVM—other compilers suffer from similar issues.
The goal is to convince you that to build a correct compiler for languages permitting unsafe pointer manipulation such as C, C++, or Rust,
we need to take IR semantics (and specifically provenance) more seriously.
I use LLVM for the examples because it is particularly easy to study with its single, extensively-documented IR that a lot of infrastructure evolved around.
Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-why-irs-need-a-precise-semantics">Warm-up: Why IRs need a precise semantics</h2>

<p>As a warm-up, I will give a simple example showing that compiler IRs such as LLVM IR need a precise (and precisely documented) semantics.
If you are already familiar with the idea of treating compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, or if you are just here for the pointers and their provenance, you can skip to the next section.</p>

<p>Consider the following simple (and contrived, for the sake of this example) piece of C code computing <code>n * (i+j)</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One transformation the compiler might want to do is to move the addition <code>i+j</code> out of the loop, to avoid computing the sum each time around the loop (this is called “loop-invariant code motion”<sup id="fnref:loop" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:loop">1</a></sup>):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// optimized version</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, that transformation is actually incorrect.
If we imagine a caller using this function as <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, then this is a perfectly correct way to call <code>sum_up</code>: the loop is never entered, so the overflowing addition <code>INT_MAX+1</code> is never performed.
However, after the desired optimization, the program now causes a signed integer overflow, which is UB (Undefined Behavior) and thus May Never Happen!</p>

<p>One might be tempted to ignore this problem because the UB on integer overflow is a compiler-only concept; every target supported by the compiler will do the obvious thing and just produce an overflowing result.
However, there might be other compiler passes running after the optimization we are considering.
One such pass might inline <code>sum_up</code>, and another pass might notice the <code>INT_MAX+1</code> and replace it by <code>unreachable</code> since UB code is “by definition” unreachable, and another pass might then just remove all our code since it is unreachable.
Each of these passes has a good reason to exist (it can help real code become a lot faster or help prune dead code), but if we combine them all with loop-invariant code motion, the result is a disaster.</p>

<p>One way (and the only systematic way I know) to avoid such problems is to make sure that we can justify the correctness of each optimization <em>in isolation</em>.
Each optimization must be <em>correct</em> for any possible program, where <em>correct</em> means that the optimized program must only “do things” that the original program could have done as well.
(This is basically the “as-if” rule in the C standard, and is typically called “refinement” in the academic literature.)
In particular, no optimization must ever introduce UB into a UB-free program.</p>

<p>It may seem now that under this premise, it is impossible to perform the loop-invariant code motion we are considering.
But that is not the case!
So far, what we have seen is that the optimization is not <em>correct</em> when being performed on a C program.
But when LLVM performs these optimizations, it does not consider the program to be written in C—it considers the program to be written in LLVM IR, which has a different semantics than C.
Specifically, the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM LangRef</a> says that signed integer overflow in LLVM IR yields a <code>poison</code> value.
It is not UB to produce <code>poison</code>, it is just UB to use <code>poison</code> in certain ways (the details of this do not matter here).
In a call to the optimized <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, the <code>s</code> variable introduced by loop-invariant code motion is unused, so the fact that its value is <code>poison</code> does not matter!</p>

<p>Due to this behavior of signed integer overflow, this case of loop-invariant code motion is <em>correct</em> if we consider it as an optimization on programs that are written in LLVM IR.<sup id="fnref:cheat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cheat">2</a></sup>
The “price” we pay for this is that replacing <code>INT_MAX+1</code> by <code>unreachable</code> is not <em>correct</em> in LLVM IR, since it is not UB.</p>

<p>The great thing about <em>correct</em> optimizations is that we can combine any number of them in any order (such as inlining, replacing definite UB by <code>unreachable</code>, and removing unreachable code), and we can be sure that the result obtained after all these optimizations is a correct compilation of our original program.
(In the academic lingo, we would say that “refinement is transitive”.)</p>

<p>However, to make the argument that an optimization is <em>correct</em>, the exact semantics of LLVM IR (what the behavior of all possible programs is and when they have UB) needs to be documented.
All involved optimizations need to exactly agree on what is and is not UB, to ensure that whatever code they produce will not be considered UB by a later optimization.
This is exactly what we also expect from the specification of a programming language such as C, which is why I think we should consider compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, and specify them with the same diligence as we would specify “normal” languages.<sup id="fnref:ub-difference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ub-difference">3</a></sup>
Sure, no human is going to write many programs in LLVM IR, so their syntax barely matters, but clang and rustc produce LLVM IR programs all the time, and as we have seen understanding the exact rules governing the behavior of programs is crucial to ensuring that the optimizations LLVM performs do not change program behavior.</p>

<p><em>Take-away:</em> If we want to be able to justify the correctness of a compiler in a modular way, considering only one optimization at a time, we need to perform these optimizations in an IR that has a precise specification of all aspects of program behavior, including UB.
Then we can, for each optimization separately, consider the question: does the optimization ever change program behavior, and does it ever introduce UB into UB-free programs?
For a <em>correct</em> optimization, the answer to these questions is “no”.</p>

<h2 id="how-3-seemingly-correct-optimizations-can-be-incorrect-when-used-together">How 3 (seemingly) correct optimizations can be incorrect when used together</h2>

<p>With the warm-up done, we are now ready to consider some more tricky optimizations, which we will use to explore the question of how precise a language specification needs to be.
We will look at three different optimizations LLVM can perform, and I will show that they <em>cannot all be correct</em> since the first and last program we are considering actually have <em>different behavior</em>.
(More precisely: the last program has a possible behavior that was not possible for the first program.)
This is only possible if at least one optimization changed program behavior in an incorrect way, but it is actually not entirely clear which optimization is the culprit.</p>

<p>The sequence of examples is taken from <a href="https://sf.snu.ac.kr/llvmtwin/files/presentation.pdf#page=32">this talk</a> by Chung-Kil Hur; it was discovered while working on a mathematically rigorous specification of LLVM.</p>

<p>Here is the source program:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I am using C syntax here just as a convenient way to write programs in LLVM IR.</p>

<p>This program has two possible behaviors: either <code>ip</code> (the address one-past-the-end of <code>p</code>) and <code>iq</code> (the address of <code>q</code>) are different, and nothing is printed.
Or the two are equal, in which case the program will print “10” (<code>iq</code> is the result of casting <code>q</code> to an integer, so casting it back will yield the original pointer, or at least a pointer pointing to the same object / location in memory).</p>

<p>The first “optimization” we will perform is to exploit that if we enter the <code>if</code> body, we have <code>iq == ip</code>, so we can replace all <code>iq</code> by <code>ip</code>.
Subsequently the definition of <code>ip</code> is inlined:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second optimization notices that we are taking a pointer <code>p+1</code>, casting it to an integer, and casting it back, so we can remove the cast roundtrip:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The final optimization notices that <code>q</code> is never written to, so we can replace <code>q[0]</code> by its initial value <code>0</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this final program is different from the first one!
Specifically, the final program will either print nothing or print “0”, while the original program <em>could never print “0”</em>.
This shows that the sequence of three optimizations we performed, as a whole, is <em>not correct</em>.</p>

				<h2 id="i">I</h2><p>In this small addendum to my essay <em><a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">The Story of COVID-19 in Sweden</a>,</em> we want to look at a very surprising statistic: the number of annual deaths in Sweden.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png" alt="" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1402w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/"><em>Number of deaths in Sweden from 2010 to 2020</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>You can find the original excel file published by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Sweden">SCB</a>—the official government agency for statistics in Sweden—<a href="https://www.scb.se/en/About-us/news-and-press-releases/statistics-sweden-to-publish-preliminary-statistics-on-deaths-in-sweden/">here</a>. The most striking aspect of these figures is, of course, the fact that there were no more deaths in Sweden this year than in any other year. (The year is not over yet, but it is almost impossible that the number of deaths will increase so much that 2020 will be a year with significantly more deaths.) And remember, Sweden did not have lockdowns nor mandatory mask laws.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I got the idea to look at the Sweden’s annual deaths statistic because a friend of mine showed me the <a href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Querschnitt/Corona/_Grafik/_Interaktiv/woechentliche-sterbefallzahlen-jahre.html?nn=209016">same statistic for Germany</a>. In Germany, as in Sweden, the number of deaths this year is not higher than in other years, but for Germany, this fact could <em>theoretically</em> be explained by lockdowns and masks. Not so for Sweden.</p><p>Someone I showed these figures to suggested that although masks were not mandatory in Sweden, perhaps everyone wore them anyway. To me, this idea immediately sounded ridiculous, and it looks like I was right.</p><p><a href="http://www.coviddatahub.com/">A survey</a> asking participants whether they wore face masks in the last seven days to protect themselves from COVID-19 found that, for example, at the end of April, in the middle of the first COVID-19 wave, 82% of Swedes never wore a face mask. This is in stark contrast to, say, Germany, where only 8% did not wear a mask.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3034b31e-bf36-4d94-a52e-c9532b9465dc/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1440w"></figure><p>The latest survey—November 9. - 15.—tells the same story.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/668bfaf9-ce60-4785-85e8-88f20cad8fa1/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1428w"></figure><p>If you look at this statistic throughout the year, you will see that in Sweden, almost nobody wore face masks, while in Germany, almost everyone did. So what is going on here? How can they not wear masks without a high number of annual deaths? Where are those <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/">7,500 COVID-19 deaths</a>?</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>To get a better picture of what happened in Sweden, we need to look at the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/">weekly number of deaths</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3af0303f-5d7a-4975-8ac0-2900d83b954b/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1342w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/"><em>Average daily number of deaths per week in Sweden in 2020, compared to the average daily number of deaths per week from 2015 to 2019</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see here, the first half of 2020 was an exceptionally deadly year. After that, and especially now, Sweden compares favorably with other years.</p><p>My explanation for this is simple: most people who would normally have died in the winter from viruses and diseases—especially the flu—died in the spring from COVID-19. This can happen because the groups at risk from these viruses appear to be similar. However, for my explanation to be true, (1) the number of influenza deaths in Sweden would have to be lower than in other years, and (2) COVID-19 would have to have a case-fatality rate (CFR) that is in the ballpark of influenza.</p><p>Requirement number one fits the data from other countries like the U.S., where flu deaths have dropped by two-thirds, as this New York Post article titled <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/24/drop-in-flu-deaths-may-indicate-that-most-at-risk-died-from-covid-19/">Drop in flu deaths may indicate that most at risk died from COVID-19</a></em> states:</p><blockquote>Flu deaths are down two-thirds from the five-year average, a drop that could indicate the most vulnerable Americans died in the first wave of COVID-19.</blockquote><p>If anyone can find good data on the number of deaths from influenza and other diseases for 2020 in Sweden, I would greatly appreciate a comment or Twitter DM.</p><p>Condition number two—the low CFR—is something I discussed in my other <a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">essay</a>. It is still not clear how deadly COVID-19 really is, but estimates are getting lower every time new data comes in, so I do not think this is unlikely.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>Whatever the explanation for the low number of annual deaths, it seems that Sweden has done “fine” without lockdowns and masks. Something I think few people would have expected, given how things are portrayed in the media—but that's a different essay. If you have another, perhaps better, explanation for these figures, feel free to suggest it in the comments.</p><p>And as always, thank you for reading my essay.</p>

            <p>The Program audio series is a fiction podcast I write, direct, edit, and produce. Fans have described it as “love child of Black Mirror and NPR”. It’s made on zero budget and has so far received over 130,000 downloads.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/1.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I described how The Program came to be and how it launched in <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results/">my first blog post</a> back in April, so if you’re an aspiring podcaster make sure you check out the first instalment as well. We’re picking up where that article left off - and just like last time, mistakes made &amp; lessons learned are in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

            <h3>US store feature</h3>

            <p>Hands down, the most important promotional vehicle for The Program so far has been Apple Podcasts. In the first 6 months since The Program’s release, they featured the show in 5 countries - Canada, Australia &amp; New Zealand, and the UK &amp; Ireland. Then in June I finally obtained the jewel in the crown - no, not India, but a spotlight in Apple Podcasts US. Noticing that The Program hadn’t been included in their newly established “Immersive Fiction” category, I notified Apple’s partner for Canada of the travesty. With tensions between the US and Canada already running high because of the steel tariffs, the matter was brought directly to Trudeau and Trump, and a compromise was soon reached: The Program will be listed as the number 1 show in “Immersive Fiction”, and Canada will concede their security council seat at the UN.</p>

            <p>Having been featured for almost 6 months now, I’m quite confident that at least half of my daily downloads is attributable to the giant from Cupertino. Spotify however remains elusive, so if anybody reading this can lend a good word please <a href="mailto:ims@programaudioseries.com">contact me</a> and help avert another international crisis.</p>

            <h3>Change of hosting</h3>

            <p>Earlier this year, my hosting provider <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/">Wooshkaa</a> changed their strategy and decided to cater to established podcasting partners - which makes sense seeing that they provide power features such as IAB certification. However, for me this meant my hosting charges would go from zero to $100 per month, which just didn’t make sense seeing that The Program’s still a money-losing operation (turns out audio drama is not the most lucrative of fields - if this were a Medium post, it’d be the highlighted section).</p>

            <p>So I switched to <a href="https://redcircle.com/">RedCircle</a>, <strong>a podcast host that’s not only free, but also boasts cool extra features</strong> such as built-in capability to accept listener donations, cross-promotion with other shows, and dynamically inserted ads - a feature I haven’t taken advantage of yet, but which brings us to a topic that seems to be quite popular.</p>

            <h3>Monetization</h3>

            <p>More than one person has asked me why I haven’t mentioned the monetary aspect in my first article (two - it was two persons). The answer is simple: back then there was no monetary aspect to talk about. At the time, the only way to support the show was to chip in a few bucks at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">buymeacoffee.com</a> - a service which seemed like an affable alternative to Patreon. However, as the builders of our civilization remarked, nomen est omen - while I was able to get a bit recurring revenue on buymeacoffee, most people treated it as a tip jar. Which is perfectly fine, since my motivation for making The Program was and is deeply intrinsic. I was becoming aware however, that in order for the show to grow I had to start generating at least some income from it - if only to compensate my collaborators who contribute their time and energy into the endeavour.</p>

            <p>So at the end of September I introduced <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/support/">five more ways to give to the show</a> with the promise of bonus material to supporters (one mini-episode and two alternative endings that were previously available to everybody). Here are the results:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://liberapay.com/Program/">Liberapay</a>: crickets</li>
                <li>Bitcoin: 1 donation sent from a friend to test the wallet</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/programaudioseries">Paypal</a>: 2 donations</li>
                <li>Interac: 3 donations</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/programaudioseries">Patreon</a>: 29 patrons pledging $125 per month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Which goes to show that <strong>Patreon is king</strong>. Which stupefies me, because for the life of me I don’t see what’s so special about it - as far as I can tell, people don’t use Patreon to find new content, meaning the service itself is not bringing me subscribers. Sure, I guess it’s true Patreon was the first site that successfully attracted people with disposable income and persuaded them to financially support content creators. But to now take a 20% cut in perpetuity (which is how much payment, platform, and payout fees deduct) seems like pure rent-seeking to me. This, combined with the fact that all these platforms are accountable only to themselves, is why I’m strategically building a relationship with my patrons exclusively through email, which is how I dispense bonus content (until a Silicon Valley company inevitably figures out how to insert themselves between people’s emails in order to extract profit).</p>

            <p>One more way I tried to raise money for the show was by selling merch. I initially looked at <a href="http://teepublic.com/">Teepublic</a> for this, but ultimately opted for the <strong>combination of <a href="http://printful.com/">Printful</a> integrated with <a href="https://launchcart.com/">LaunchCart</a>, as it offered more customization and the ability to set my own profit margins</strong>. The result is The Program’s <a href="https://store.programaudioseries.com/">official store</a>, where I sold a whopping 4 items. However, I do feel like I’ve got myself to blame for that, as I don’t think I’ve done my best to create compelling products, and I plan to give it another go later on - but I’m definitely <strong>putting merch on hold until my audience grows much bigger</strong>.</p>

            <p>While I still haven’t inserted ads into the show (and at this point have no plans to), I was able to attract the show’s first sponsor: a lovely lad by the name of Boris and his company <a href="https://atlasauthority.com/">Atlas Authority</a> reached out and bought the show the recording equipment, allowing us to own the means of production and bringing the global class struggle one step closer to its end. Boris shrewdly realized that investing in the show now - while probably not making most sense from the strict numbers perspective - assures that his message will be heard in the years to come with exactly the kind of audience his Atlassian consulting company wants to attract. And if The Program crashes and burns, hey, at least they supported something that brings joy to people, versus giving money to Mark Zuckerberg. Speak of the devil...</p>

            <h3>Social media</h3>

            <p>Early on I made the decision not to promote The Program on any properties owned by Facebook, which probably hurts the show, but helps me live with myself. The two networks I am active on are Twitter and Reddit.</p>

            <p>The two couldn’t be more different. From my experience, Twitter is where the rich and the famous pontificate to the masses and no real communication takes place. Despite making original content for over a year now, I had little success either getting new listeners or building any sense of a community. I still post there but mostly because I enjoy making <a href="https://twitter.com/TheProgramAS/status/1274740157854466049">illustrated quotes</a> from the show and I don’t know where else to publish these. But my point stands that <strong>I do not recommend spending time on Twitter if your goal is to organically promote an audio drama</strong>.</p>

            <p>Being a part of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programaudioseries/">reddit</a> on the other hand has been nothing but pleasure. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgramAudioSeries/">The Program’s subreddit</a> facilitated some great discussions, allowed me to get valuable feedback, and most definitely promoted the show to new audiences. Especially valuable was the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/">r/audiodrama</a>, adeptly moderated by Hitch42, which is shaping into <strong>a must place to promote any audio fiction</strong>. I also gained quite a number of downloads from a post I was allowed to publish in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/">r/blackmirror</a> that compared the two shows (still waiting for someone to call Black Mirror “The Program you watch instead of listening to”).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/3.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I definitely shouldn’t forget to mention HackerNews crowd again, not only for being so kind to repeatedly upvote and promote The Program’s threads, but also for being a wonderful resource and a constant source of inspiration (incidentally, it also has an absolutely masterful moderator going under the moniker dang, offering further proof that mods are the secret ingredient to successful online communities).</p>

            <h3>Contributors</h3>

            <p>During the course of the year, my collaboration with <a href="http://christienledroit.ca/">Christien Ledroit</a>, a super talented musician (and incidentally a neighbour), grew ever more fruitful. Chris so far supplied music for five episodes, three of which he fully scored - in some cases actually facilitating the episode to transpire (for example, I wouldn’t have made <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/14-more-parrot-than-predator/">More parrot than predator</a> were it not for Chris who created the soundscape that comes alive in synch with the A.I. from the story). Chris is currently scoring three more episodes in various stages of production, so expect to hear many more of his fine works.</p>

            <p>The music that isn’t made specifically for the show mostly comes from <a href="https://www.neosounds.com/">Neosounds</a>, a royalty-free website I can <strong>absolutely recommend for the quality of their tunes and ease of use</strong>, and also because they have been generous enough to kindly extend the discount they provided to this poor producer (cost of music is the main reason the show is still not profitable even with the supporters and owning the equipment).</p>

            <p>On the visual side of things, the show’s artist <a href="https://en.cdacosta.art/">Carlos Costa</a> continues to amaze with his official illustrations, depicting three more episodes and creating new show art (which you can see at the top of the page).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/4.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>While mentioning contributors, I would be remiss to not mention all the wonderful actors who have literally given The Program a voice. A lot of them became frequent collaborators and you can find out more about them not only in the show’s credits available at this website, …</p></div></div>

                    <p><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/"><strong>S</strong>olarWinds</a>' credentials exposure from 2019 gives an important clue to how the breach at FireEye and US government possibly took place. It sheds light over a very important aspect that organizations often ignore – their insecure practices and inefficiency in securing credentials. <a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a> has identified weak credentials in hundreds of organizations over the course of years that we tested or, engaged in pentest with, and the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> breach seems to be just another case of gross carelessness and weak credentials. Although not confirmed by official sources, this is what we can conjecture for now. This reveals a very important piece of the puzzle, that is &nbsp;the attack was possibly not as sophisticated as it was reported to be.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">official blog post published yesterday</a>, FireEye said a "<em>highly evasive attacker </em>by <em>leveraging SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with SUNBURST Backdoor". </em>The original blog post from FireEye has been linked below</p><figure><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html"><div><p>Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to CompromiseMultiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor</p><p>We have discovered a global intrusion campaign, and we are tracking the actors behind this campaign as UNC2452.</p><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/brand/logos/fireeye.ico"><span>FireEye</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/fw/images/fireeye-2-color-square.png"></p></a><figcaption>FireEye article about the SolarWind breach</figcaption></figure><p><strong>H</strong>owever, a recent tweet from a <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">cybersecurity researcher</a> hints at the fact this compromise probably dates back to 2019, that is more than an year before the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> and US government breach were reported, and the attacker might have been able to own their servers through very simple techniques. Password spraying is a very common technique employed by malicious attackers to compromise systems. In the case of SolarWinds this was even simpler, and weaker credentials may have made the hacker's job just more easier.</p><h2 id="solarwinds-exposed-their-ftp-credentials-in-a-public-github-repository">SolarWinds Exposed their FTP credentials in a public GitHub Repository</h2><p> <strong>Cybersecurity expert, </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/">Vinoth Kumar</a> hinted at the fact that the perpetrator may have breached SolarWinds and its clients quite easily – this affects the US government, and top organizations worldwide. Kumar made the following tweet today,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Was reading about a sophisticated attack on FireEye leveraging Solarwinds. Hmmm how that would happened?🤔. Then realized their password was *****123 🤣 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FireEye?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FireEye</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SolarWinds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SolarWinds</a> <a href="https://t.co/foGzEOdytG">pic.twitter.com/foGzEOdytG</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338431183588188160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>Vinoth Kumar's tweet regarding the exposed FTP credentials of SolarWinds</figcaption></figure><p>For the readers who couldn't fully understand the tweet, Vinoth had apparently gotten access to a SolarWinds FTP server on 19th November, 2019 through FTP credentials leaked in a SolarWinds public <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> repo (apparently a<em> configuration</em> file as can be observed from the above email screenshot) which is more than one year ago. He responsibly reported this security incident to the SolarWinds PSIRT team.</p><p>The above tweet includes a screenshot of Vinoth's email communication with the SolarWinds' security team who seem to have acknowledged the issue, but its unclear whether after the incident SolarWinds hardened their server security.</p><h2 id="nation-state-adversary-or-a-simple-github-leak">Nation-State adversary or, a simple Github Leak?</h2><p>Exposing password in public GitHub repositories is a very common security lapse among organizations but can be prevented quite easily with secure practices. We have identified thousands of credentials belonging to companies and responsibly reported such cases. This happened in the case of SolarWinds too, Vinoth found their FTP server credentials which allowed read as well as write access to SolarWinds' FTP server. This critical vulnerability could have allowed them to upload malicious files and binaries to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, which made the SolarWinds Orion software available to its clients for download.</p><p>Vinoth confirmed that the FTP credentials SolarWinds leaked had write access by uploading a test file to the vulnerable FTP server – <a href="https://downloads.solarwinds.com/">downloads.solarwinds.com</a> which apparently hosts very important files, and if tampered with, the results can be disastrous, which was likely the reason of the US Government breach that happened recently. </p><h2 id="solarwinds-might-have-been-compromised-at-least-an-year-ago-in-november-2019">SolarWinds might have been compromised at least an year ago, in November 2019</h2><p>SolarWinds' PSIRT team's last reply to Vinoth was on 22nd November, 2019 which is 3 days after his report, </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the last response I got from them. <a href="https://t.co/Q24JGb3mvr">pic.twitter.com/Q24JGb3mvr</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338449660327854080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>SolarWinds Security Team's response to Vinoth Kumar acknowledging the vulnerability</figcaption></figure><p>They have informed him that the Github repository exposing the credentials was subsequently taken down by SolarWinds. This may have played an important role in the latest security breach of SolarWinds that led to the US Government breach.</p><h2 id="complex-attack-or-a-case-of-weak-credentials">Complex Attack or, a Case of Weak Credentials?</h2><p>Vinoth further mentions in the tweet that the password was <code>*****123</code>. Our <strong>guess</strong> is that, the password of that FTP server was <code>solarwinds123</code>, leaving the redacted part, which is a very weak credential. <code>solarwinds123</code> is an example of the weakest credentials one can think of. &nbsp;Credentials of the FTP download server which was exposed on the SolarWinds GitHub repo are as follows – <code>solarwindsnet:solarwinds123</code></p><p>It would take seconds for advanced credential stuffing tools to exfiltrate into SolarWinds networks leading to the supply chain of the malware used in this attack, which seems to be the case here. Weak and easy to guess credentials continue to be a very common cause of breaches that happens these days. We have observed a lot of big companies using <code>admin:admin</code> and easy to guess credentials in their internal panels, while we performed pentests and bug hunting research. </p><p>This is an ideal example to learn from, what the consequence of weak credentials can be. Organizations should learn from these breaches how easy it is for attackers to compromise an entire organization just by guessing credentials and performing password stuffing attacks.</p><p><em>Although there is more to it that led to the series of events</em>, but the exposed and weak credentials might have played a major role in the SolarWinds hack. The attackers might have been able to gain persistence by obtaining SolarWinds internal credentials and then able to backdoor the SolarWinds Orion (which FireEye called the SUNBURST backdoor, https://downloads.solarwinds.com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp) by uploading it to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, and distributing the same via SolarWinds website to its clients.</p><h2 id="qa-with-cybersecurity-expert-vinoth-kumar">Q&amp;A with Cybersecurity Expert <a href="https://vinothkumar.me/">Vinoth Kumar</a></h2><p>We asked cybersecurity expert Vinoth about his opinions on this breach, and how organizations can secure themselves from such sophisticated attacks.</p><p><strong>Q: As you mentioned you found some credentials in the open, do you think the attackers went for a similar approach to use simple OSINT techniques in order to exfiltrate the data?</strong></p><p><strong>Vinoth: </strong>I think the attackers must have used the same approach as the FTP server was open &amp; credentials were not strong enough. But it was a sophisticated attack as the binaries were signed.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you think organizations can protect themselves from breaches and exposing their credentials?</strong></p><p><strong>Vinoth: </strong>Normally most of the companies includes us use the automated scanner for GitHub repos scanning to see any leaked internal credential also security credential scanning should be part of SDLC process.</p><p>Vinoth's social handles and website – <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">vinothsparrow</a> and <a href="https://vinothkumar.me/">VinothKumar.me</a></p><h2 id="notable-victims-of-the-solarwinds-breach">Notable Victims of the SolarWinds Breach</h2><p>US Treasury, the US NTIA, and possibly FireEye itself.

                    <p>I'm pretty impressed by what I've seen with Apple's M1 Chip. It's really fast and powerful for essential everyday tasks, which include browsing the web, working with Intel-based apps, and using programming apps. Yes – the ecosystem is moving, and that may take time, but I think M1 is worth paying for it because of its phenomenal performance.</p><p>M1 is fast, and many benchmarks have proved its performance. However, I was curious about the performance of the programming languages using M1. So I decided to test it for the most popular workloads here.</p><p>Before you see the results, you should know that some benchmark suites are memory-intensive, some are CPU-intensive, and some have no benefits with multi-core processing because of its overhead or its difficulty for utilizing. It means that M1 can have an advantage over the desktop-class multi-core Ryzen processor even though the core count is lesser. <strong>Most importantly, I've focused more on real-world development performance testing rather than synthetic, production tests.</strong></p><p>You can check the raw benchmark data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4U7LAImfEcXRihJbySZcRr32tn6WSWAtslfXltds58/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>I add the following comment as of Dec 14: we care how fast our dev computer runs. the multi-core advantage of 3900X is useless for most of the benchmarks here that don't represent the real-world production performance at all but devs usually work on their laptops, desktops, etc most of the time so I think such real-world development performance benchmarks make it worthwhile though. of course, Ryzen 3900X will perform way better than M1 and Intel when it comes to production, mostly achieved by parallelizing.</p><h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2><ul><li>Apple M1: Mac Mini (16GB RAM), MacBook Air (8GB RAM) / macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (All executables used for benchmarks are natively compiled for Apple Silicon.)</li><li>Ryzen 3900X: ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T / 16GB DDR4-3200 x 2 / Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (tested after shutting down background tasks.) – You may wonder why I used 3900X instead of Ryzen 5000-series CPUs: Because I don't have it.

<h2>Why I Quit a $500K Job at Amazon to Work for Myself</h2>



<p>Last week I left my cushy job at Amazon after 8 years. Despite getting rewarded repeatedly with promotions, compensation, recognition, and praise, I wasn’t motivated enough to do another year.</p>



<p>I spent my entire time in AWS building tools for developers. I liked that field so much that I would have been satisfied working in it for the rest of my life.</p>



<p>I joined Amazon as an entry level developer. Within 3.5 years I had been promoted twice to a senior engineer, and I was practically guaranteed another promotion to principal engineer this year if I had stayed. My potential at the company was high, I was told.</p>



<p>My esteem within the company grew along the years and I was regarded an expert and a leader in my field. People looked up to me and respected me.</p>



<p>I made $75K in my first year and that gradually grew to $511K by my last year. I could have made another $1M if I stayed another couple of years.</p>



<p>My work–life balance was good too, despite Amazon’s reputation. I didn’t need to prove myself anymore, and I could get everything done in 40 hours a week. My team worked from home one day a week, and I rarely opened my laptop at night or weekends.</p>



<p>Also, the people I worked with were exceptional. I had three managers in total, and all were generous people with lots of empathy. I’m very grateful to everyone I worked with.</p>



<p>Everything was going well and getting better. But despite all this, my motivation to go to work each morning was decreasing—almost in an inverse trend to my career and income growth.</p>

<p>It would have been foolish of me to expect my motivation to start increasing if I got yet another promotion, or another compensation bump, or another big project. But there was something else that was trending down with my motivation. It was my freedom.</p>



<h3>The Motivation Decline</h3>



<p>For the first couple of years my motivation was off the charts. I was mostly working with another person on an internal tool, and there was very little scrutiny around it. It was a time where I had a lot of independence in choosing how to work and what to work on—at least relative to more recent years.  It was just me and the other person improving this thing, talking to users, releasing updates, testing it, and everything else. Whatever we felt was important, we generally got to do. We did the best work we could for its own sake and we were mostly self-directed.</p>



<p>The last couple of years, however, were quite different. I was leading the most important project in the history of my department, with many stakeholders and complex goals. What I could do was always bounded by my ability to convince all the people involved that it was the best way to navigate our goals. </p>



<p>I was always going to be working on somebody else’s terms at Amazon. The terms were simple in the beginning (keep fixing the thing), but kept getting more complicated as the years passed by (maximize all goals; satisfy all stakeholders). Then there were other restrictions inherent to working in a large organization about how to do the work, what work to do, what goals to set, and what business was worth pursuing. This situation was squeezing me into doing things that I’d rather not do, and vice versa.</p>



<h3 id="mce_19">Finding New Motivation</h3>



<p>What kind of work would I do if I had to do it forever? Not something that I did until I reached some milestone (an exit), but something that I would consider satisfactory if I continued to do it until I’m 80. What is out there that I could do that would make me excited waking up every day for the next 45 years that could also earn me enough money to cover my expenses? Is that too unambitious? I don’t think so. Because there are two types of drivers that get me out of bed in the morning.</p>



<p>One comes from the outside in the form of a carrot or a stick. For instance, I’m not automatically driven to do my tax returns every April, but I make sure I do because I don’t want to go to prison. Or I might not want to work on something I dislike, but I do so anyway because I may need to pay the bills, or want to buy a fancy car. These are the extrinsic motivators.</p>



<p>The other comes from within. This is what drives me to do things when there isn’t a carrot or a stick. Hobbies are one activity driven by this. But what I was looking for was something that I could do for a living that was also driven by this type of motivation: the intrinsic kind.</p>



<p>Back to the question of whether this is too unambitious. See, I realized that extrinsic motivation doesn’t last. Whenever I got promoted, it felt good for a week, and then it was as over. When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.</p>



<p>The things that don’t wear off are those that I’ve been doing since I was a kid, when nothing was forcing me to do them. Things such as writing code, selling my creations, charting my own path, calling it like I saw it. I know my strengths, and I know what motivates me, so why not do this all the time? I’m lucky to live in a time where I can do something independently in my area of expertise without requiring large amounts of capital or outside investors. So that’s what I’m doing.</p>



<h3>What’s Next?</h3>



<p>I’m going all in on independence, and I’m going to try to make a living with my own bare hands starting from nothing. I don’t expect to only do things that I like, but it will be on my terms. My target is to cover my family’s expenses before I run out of savings while doing something that intrinsically motivates me. What more would I ever want to be satisfied with my work?</p>

December 14, 2020 | https://write.privacytools.io/freddy/why-privacy-matters-even-if-you-have-nothing-to-hide | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://write.privacytools.io/freddy/why-privacy-matters-even-if-you-have-nothing-to-hide">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The overwhelming majority of people do not seem to care about privacy. They ask why they should care if they have “nothing to hide”. Yet this idea of hiding is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>The United Nations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy" rel="nofollow">state</a> that privacy is a human right, just like the right to education is. So why on earth would you give that up? The famous (and somewhat obligatory) quote from Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower:</p>

<blockquote><p>Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question about privacy is not about hiding, it is about sharing. It is not that I have nothing to hide, I just do not have anything I want to share, especially unknowingly.&nbsp;This whole narrative that privacy is only for nefarious people is pushed by those who quite clearly care alot about privacy. Mark Zuckerberg spent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-neighbouring-houses" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of dollars</a> buying the houses that surrounded his home, for example. The irony is painful.</p>

<p>We all care about our privacy, though we might not know it. It is why we lock the door when we go to the toilet; or why we close the curtains to stop people looking into our homes.</p>

<p>In her essay for Aeon Magazine, Carissa Véliz <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-us-all" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that privacy is power. It is the power “to show you ads... and to predict your behaviour”. But it is also the power to influence. Increasingly, Big Tech, the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, are sharing more and more information with governments. In turn, governments are starting to learn more and more about their citizens. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun – and this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy to be normal – and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being judged by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.</p>

<p>The war is not lost, however. We paved the path for Big Tech, though we no longer have to follow it. If we change our actions then a lot can be achieved. In most instances, alternatives to mainstream products, such as Google, are available. <a href="https://privacytools.io/" rel="nofollow">PrivacyTools.io</a> is a website, of which I am a team member, designed to showcase tools and knowledge to protect your privacy, along with housing a wonderful community of like minded privacy advocates. By simply switching to a few of the recommended services and installing some of the recommended add-ons we can slowly reverse the damage that was done. Furthermore, if you live in the EU, you can use your rights under GDPR to ensure all data that companies have on you is erased.</p>

<p>Privacy matters, regardless of who you are. We seriously need to start protecting it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              <div>
              <p>Developers spend most of their time reading code, understanding it and exploring other ways to use existing solutions. Frankly, in our profession, there is very little time on actually writing new libraries and creating new interfaces in real-life development. So it is quite important to have some help in the most common activities. <strong>Naming conventions</strong> is one such thing that improves readability and eases the usage cost if agreed upon and spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Some languages have their own special naming conventions that make sense. Haskell is among them. There are a bunch of naming patterns that are commonly used everywhere in the ecosystem (including the standard libraries) that may help you to recognise the function’s meaning without looking at its documentation and even its type! This ability is especially relevant because naming is one of the hardest development problems, so having some help and no-brainer rules to guide in this area improves everyone’s life.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore common naming conventions in Haskell together. It is going to be useful for both creators (library and API developers) and consumers (library users), as it establishes norms accepted in the libraries’ APIs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🦋 If you are interested in other conventions and best practices on how to write Haskell code, you can take a look at our <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide">style guide</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="checked">Checked<a href="#checked">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the conventional and straightforward norms established in Haskell’s specifications and standards. Names in Haskell must satisfy the following simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types and typeclasses</strong> must start with an <em>uppercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Functions and variables</strong> must start with a <em>lowercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Top-level operator functions</strong> must start with any allowed symbol except for <code>:</code></li>
<li><strong>Constructors as operators</strong> must start with <code>:</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are in the specifications and therefore checked by the compiler. So if you try to break the naming rules, you will get errors during the compilation.</p>
<p>Additionally, functions follow the <strong>lowerCamelCase</strong> style and types follow the <strong>UpperCamelCase</strong> style. This is the de facto standard of writing code in Haskell, but using distinct styles doesn’t lead to a compiler error. Moreover, there are some testing libraries that use <em>snake_case </em>to discover tests automatically. However, you can restrict that with the Haskell tooling, e.g.&nbsp;HLint can check this for you.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are various details in the names that will give you hints on what the function does. We will walk through them to learn to recognise them all.</p>
<h2 id="type-variables">Type variables<a href="#type-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start our excursions with the type variables that are most commonly used in type signatures and definitions. Some variables represent particular meaning: it could be a typeclass-related convention or just a convenient shorter usage. But in any way, this information is useful to know while reading and writing types:</p>
<div>
<p><code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, …</p>
<div>
<p>Ordinary type variables with no particular meaning</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>map</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>f</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Functor</code> or <code>Applicative</code></p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>m</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Monad</code> or <code>Semigroup</code>/<code>Monoid</code></p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m b) <span>-&gt;</span> m b</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>(&lt;&gt;) ::</span> <span>Semigroup</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>e</code></p>
<div>
<p>Types representing errors</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>failures ::</span> [<span>Validation</span> e a] <span>-&gt;</span> [e]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>t</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Foldable</code> or <code>Traversable</code></p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>concat</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> t [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or types of kind <code>Type</code> (previously <code>*</code>)</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> (<span>t ::</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>=</span> <span>Size</span> <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>k</code></p>
<div>
<p>Kind</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> (<span>++</span>) (<span>xs ::</span> [k]) (<span>ys ::</span> [k])<span> ::</span> [k]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="function-variables">Function variables<a href="#function-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The way we name arguments and variables in functions is also not accidental. They contain hints that make reading these variables used in function bodies easier. Variables in functions use the following established commonly used names:</p>
<div>
<p><code>l</code></p>
<p>Lists variable</p>
<p><code>(x:xs)</code> or <code>(y:ys)</code></p>
<div>
<p>Patterns for lists where <code>x</code> means a single x and <code>xs</code> means <em>many <code>x</code>s</em></p>
<p>Also used together with the previous one with as-patterns:</p>

</div>
<p><code>f</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>h</code></p>
<div>
<p>Function arguments</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>map</span> f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> <span>map</span> f xs</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>p</code></p>
<div>
<p>Functions which are predicates (e.g.&nbsp;of type <code>Int -&gt; Bool</code>)</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>bar ::</span> (<span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">bar p i <span>=</span> <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>n</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code></p>
<p>Miscellaneous counters</p>
<p><code>len</code></p>
<p>Container size</p>
<p><code>go</code></p>

</div>
<h2 id="suffixes">Suffixes<a href="#suffixes">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Suffix in a Haskell function can contain a lot of information about its purpose. Sometimes you would see multiple different suffixes simultaneously that combine the characteristics of each piece, so it is helpful to pay attention to that.</p>
<h4 id="apostrophe">Apostrophe ’<a href="#apostrophe">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The <code>'</code> symbol is used in the functions, for which there is a corresponding function without the apostrophe, e.g.&nbsp;<code>foo</code> and <code>foo'</code>.</p>
<p>The apostrophe at the end means that it’s a <strong>strict</strong> version of a similar function. Both functions must have the same type, but different implementations underneath. The only difference in their behaviour is that the one with the <code>'</code> symbol evaluates intermediate results more eagerly.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>foldMap</span><span>  ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>foldMap' ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, both functions have the same type. But <code>foldMap'</code> is more efficient and helps to avoid space leaks when monoidal operation <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is strict in both arguments.</p>
<h3 id="typeclasses">Typeclasses<a href="#typeclasses">🔗</a></h3>
<p>There is a group of symbols that is used to indicate that the function returns the value in some context. This suffix – an uppercase letter or word – tells us the typeclass this context should represent.</p>
<p>Meet the <code>FAM</code>ily 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦</p>
<h4 id="f">F<a href="#f">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>F</code> suggests that it works with <code>Functor</code>s in some way.</p>
<p>Such functions can have an alternative without the suffix <code>F</code>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers">containers</a> library:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">alter</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb12-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb12-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">alterF</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><span>    ::</span> (<span>Functor</span> f, <span>Ord</span> k)</span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Maybe</span> a))</span>
<span id="cb13-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb13-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb13-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Map</span> k a)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, sometimes the suffix <code>F</code> has an alternative meaning. <code>F</code> frequently used as a suffix in formatting libraries to indicate that a function is a <em>formatter</em> or a <em>pretty-printer</em>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt">fmt</a> library:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>timeF ::</span> <span>FormatTime</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BuilderSource</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see how the same naming can have different meanings. What’s important is that the library establishes its naming convention explicitly and uses it consistently.</p>
<h4 id="a">A<a href="#a">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>A</code> means that the function works with some general <code>Applicative</code> type (the type that has the <code>Applicative</code> instance).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>sequenceA</span><span> ::</span> (<span>Traversable</span> t, <span>Applicative</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> t (f a) <span>-&gt;</span> f (t a)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="m">M<a href="#m">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>M</code> is among the most common ones. It usually means that the function works with the <code>Monad</code>s or in the monadic context.</p>
<p>Similarly to the previous suffixes, functions <em>with</em> <code>M</code> have their counterparts <em>without</em> <code>M</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>filter</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>    ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb16-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">filterM</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> m</span>
<span id="cb17-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb17-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> m [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Historically, the standard Haskell library <code>base</code> didn’t have <code>Applicative</code> functors, and there weren’t the superclass of Monads. But now the suffix <code>M</code> is also sometimes used with Applicative functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="underscore-_">Underscore _<a href="#underscore-_">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Underscore, as a suffix of functions, also has a special meaning. It gives us a clue that the function works exactly as the one without <code>_</code> but discards the result (returns <code>()</code> instead).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">concurrently</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb18-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb18-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> (a, b)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1">concurrently_</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb19-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb19-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="number">Number<a href="#number">🔗</a></h3>
<p>You can often see the series of functions with the numbers at the end of their names. These groups have the same initial part but differ with the number. Numbers there represent the <strong>number of arguments</strong> each function takes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔢 The number 1 is not used usually in that meaning as it’s redundant.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>liftA  ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f</span>
<span id="cb20-2">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)</span>

<p>Number 1 has a special meaning of requiring at least one argument to be present in a container:</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>foldr</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb26-2"><span>foldr1</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Though, the fact that it works with <code>Foldable</code> is not ideal. There is <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/13573">a proposal</a> to implement a typeclass called <code>Foldable</code> (or <code>Semifoldable</code>) for non-empty types.</p>
<h3 id="lr">L/R<a href="#lr">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The suffixes <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> (sometimes <code>l</code> and <code>r</code>) represent the direction of function application or order of traversing a data structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ Most of the time, these sibling functions have the same type, but in some functions, certain arguments are reversed for convenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>foldr</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb27-2"><span>foldl</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb27-3"></span>
<span id="cb27-4"><span>scanr</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-5"><span>scanl</span><span> ::</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-6"></span>
<span id="cb27-7"><span>mapAccumR ::</span> <span>Traversable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, c)) <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> t b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, t c)</span>
<span id="cb27-8"><span>mapAccumL ::</span> <span>Traversable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, c)) <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> t b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, t c)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="byon">By/On<a href="#byon">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Some of the overloaded functions that work with <code>Foldable</code>s or lists have a non-overloaded sibling with the suffix <code>By</code>.</p>
<p>It is often convenient to use these functions together with <code>on</code>, for instance:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1">sortBy (<span>compare</span> <span>`on`</span> <span>fst</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This <code>on</code> pattern is so widely used, so functions also have the suffix <code>On</code>.</p>
<p>Compare these three types:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb29"><pre><code><span id="cb29-1"><span>sort</span></span>
<span id="cb29-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a</span>
<span id="cb29-3"></span>
<span id="cb29-4">    <span>=&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb29-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb30"><pre><code><span id="cb30-1">sortBy</span>
<span id="cb30-2"></span>
<span id="cb30-3"><span>    ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ordering</span>)</span>
<span id="cb30-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb30-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb31"><pre><code><span id="cb31-1">sortOn</span>
<span id="cb31-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> b</span>
<span id="cb31-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)</span>
<span id="cb31-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb31-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="p">P<a href="#p">🔗</a></h3>
<p>In some libraries or applications’ code, the suffix <code>P</code> shows that the function is a parser of some type, e.g.&nbsp;when using the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> library. The usage of this naming convention can look like this:</p>
<div id="cb32"><pre><code><span id="cb32-1"><span>data</span> <span>Config</span> <span>=</span> <span>Config</span></span>
<span id="cb32-2">    {<span> configPort ::</span> <span>Port</span></span>

                <div>
                    <p><strong>Confusing UI design = Recipe for Disaster</strong> – &nbsp;Setting up 2FA on our PayPal business account was exactly that. Usually most payment providers make 2FA a mandate in the setup process, or, at least asks its users to set it up during sign up itself, but PayPal doesn't. I have no complaints about PayPal's Infosec standards as they have been running a successful bug bounty program on Hackerone and seem to have a very responsive and active security team. </p><h2 id="update">Update</h2><p>We did some more research and found out this problem has been there for more than 2 years now yet no action from PayPal's end – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth">https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth</a></p><p>We haven't received any response from PayPal yet but have gotten in touch with them regarding the same.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-4.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-4.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png 1525w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Users complaining about the issue on PayPal</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2fa-and-account-compromise">2FA and Account Compromise</h2><p>Setting up 2FA is really critical for account security, and PayPal accounts are no different – naturally, they are a more interesting target for hackers due to the price tag attached to them. Thus, enabling 2FA in the first place would be the most logical step to prevent unauthorized account intrusions and account hacks, as every log in would require a TOTP code from an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or, Authy as part of the 2FA process. However, I found this process really hard due to the confusing documentation on PayPal website. </p><p>The process to setup 2FA on PayPal for account security was by far the most difficult, time consuming and confusing process ever but when we get to it... you can realize how simple it could have actually been. Its the most important step to take to prevent getting your PayPal account hacked or, breached or, compromised. In this post, I have explained the full process and why it was so confusing.</p><p>PayPal's confusing UI design can become a threat to user account security &nbsp;as it makes it harder for users to setup 2FA for their accounts.</p><p>But it was, really... I mean <strong>REALLY</strong> difficult for me to locate their 2FA option. I couldn't spot it anywhere in their UI even after several Google searches about this, nothing showed up – whatever did was either too outdated or, totally useless or, deprecated. </p><p>Confused, I got in touch with their Customer Support who pointed me to their the <strong>Settings </strong>page, and told a <strong>Security </strong>page was located there. But... what? I couldn't find one. Weird, that's how difficult PayPal makes it to simply add an additional layer of security to your account. This made me wonder, why is it so difficult to enable a simple security feature like 2FA on PayPal? I tried everything, every button and navigation links on their Android and iOS apps too but failed to locate the 2FA setup page.</p><p>Utterly disappointed, when I came across <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">this</a> Help Center Article which was disguised in the form of a general FAQ about 2FA but, finally I found that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">magic link</a>! – </p><figure><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete"><div><p>what-is-2-step-verification</p><p><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/icon/pp196.png"></p></div></a></figure><p>Well, there's a catch. </p><h2 id="the-catch">The Catch</h2><p>When you are <strong>logged out</strong>, PayPal would show the following 2FA Setup process instructions in their <strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">Documentation/Help Guide</a> – </strong></p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-1.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-1.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png 1637w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-out 2FA Setup Guide</figcaption></figure><p>However, when you are <strong>logged in, </strong>the instructions asked you to go to profile page and setup 2FA from there – <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">this</a> is the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">final link</a> that leads to the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">2FA setup process</a>. This is <strong>how simple it could have been, </strong>but confusing documentation on the help pages and equally misleading instructions given by customer support made the process incredibly hard and confusing!</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-2.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-2.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-2.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png 1715w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-in Profile Page for 2FA Setup</figcaption></figure><h2 id="steps-to-setup-or-add-2fa-to-your-paypal-account-business-account-users-">Steps to setup or, add 2FA to your PayPal account (Business account users)</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Update</strong> after navigating to <strong>Login and Security</strong> page from PayPal Profile page navigation</li>
<li>After clicking on Update, choose your 2FA option. <strong>Choose Authenticator</strong> which is more secure than mobile phone based 2FA. I prefer <strong>Authy</strong>. PayPal 2FA should work with most TOTP authenticator apps.</li>
<li>Scan the code with your Authenticator app or, manually enter the code</li>
<li>Enter the TOTP code on PayPal website after adding PayPal in the Authenticator app,</li>
<li>You have succesffully added 2FA to your PayPal account. To make it more secure, you can go ahead and add SMS 2FA layer as extra defence too.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Turns out PayPal might have done some UI revamping which effectively resulted in concealing the <strong>Security </strong>page's navigation from Account Settings page.

Every major payment provider allows merchants and business users to setup 2FA right from the mobile – but I couldn't find the option in either of the apps – neither Android nor iOS which is bad from a security and accessibility standpoint.</p><h2 id="my-opinion">My Opinion</h2><p>PayPal itself isn't insecure but these are what I call – classic business logic errors. The UI is the first step towards making a better application and give an overall good experience to the average consumer. Secondly, I had to face a not-so knowledgeable customer support staff who explained how to <strong>navigate to 2FA setup, </strong>but turns out that's not the actual way. I have spent probably tens of thousands of dollars <em>over</em>paying PayPal fees and this is what I get in terms of value for money or, my ROI, a bad user experience (UX). I'm not blaming anyone – but despite charging so much in fees, PayPal still hasn't been able to provide a proper UI/UX to its clients. There are several pain points in their UI, and nothing much has changed in most critical parts of their web app since the past 10-12 years, only some parts of the UI/UX has been revamped but some <strong>areas </strong>like 2FA setup are harder because of PayPal's extremely clunky and confusing UI.</p><p>If app developers don't design the UI properly, they can unintentionally cause losses on the part of their users – as in this case, a legitimate user couldn't setup 2FA on their account due to a buggy UI. I strongly feel UI and UX form a core part of an Application's security and not just the backend and frontend parts involving code. <strong>The UI features should encourage the user to enable more security features in the app, </strong>but in this case – it was misleading and confusing.</p><h2 id="harder-ui-more-security-issues-effectively">Harder UI = More Security Issues, effectively</h2><p>With harder UI in fine grained applications with varying levels of access controls, it becomes increasingly harder for users to manage account restrictions and security policies. As in this example, the <strong>Security </strong>page was hidden from the view which potentially makes a user account more susceptible to compromise. A better and smooth UI ensures a user is able to setup every security setting to optimal level. </p><p>Harder the UI = More the confusion on the part of the user. This can leave organization accounts open to breaches and evidently a lot of hackers are exploiting misconfigurations in application due to user ignorance.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2><p>The entire process was far more painstaking and confusing, than how simple it should have been on the contrary. Thus, making a more intuitive and proper UI is very important from user security point of view than a confusing feature-loaded loosely designed product. Also, security features like 2FA should be mandated in applications dealing with payments and high value transactions in general. Due to a UI revamp or, refactor, that missed putting into place the Security link in Navigation, users can miss the 2FA setup and for those using weak credentials can end up getting hand – which is how hundreds of thousands of PayPal accounts and Credit Card &nbsp;data aka <strong>Fullz </strong>end up getting hacked and sold on darknet marketplaces.</p><blockquote><em><strong>How we can help?</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong><a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a></strong> conducts in-depth security research, bug hunting, and security consultancy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I still need to write the blog post explaining “What is the Hidden Friend Idiom?”;
but for now, here’s a practical demonstration of its usefulness that just came up
on the cpplang Slack (thanks, Johan Lundberg!).</p>

<p>Consider this pair of class templates <code>Cat&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Dog&lt;T&gt;</code>. <code>Cat</code> is analogous to
the STL’s container templates, which define <code>operator&lt;</code> (or in C++20, <code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code>)
as a free function template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class V&gt;
struct Cat {
    V value_;
};

template&lt;class V&gt;
bool operator&lt;(const Cat&lt;V&gt;&amp; a, const Cat&lt;V&gt;&amp; b) {
    return a.value_ &lt; b.value_;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>Dog</code> is how I <em>recommend</em> everyone write their
overloaded operators, as hidden friend non-templates.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class V&gt;
struct Dog {
    V value_;

    friend bool operator&lt;(const Dog&amp; a, const Dog&amp; b) {
        return a.value_ &lt; b.value_;
    }
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider the following “<code>sort_in_place</code>” algorithm, which
uses <code>reference_wrapper</code> to sort a vector of <em>handles pointing into</em>
its const argument vector, instead of sorting the argument vector
itself. (I’ve never found this trick useful in practice, but it’s
a very cute demonstration of how the different pieces of the STL
fit together. I use basically this code in the <code>reference_wrapper</code>
unit of my <a href="https://cppcon.org/class-2020-classic-stl/">“Classic STL”</a> training course.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt;
void sort_in_place(const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; vt) {
    std::vector&lt;std::reference_wrapper&lt;const T&gt;&gt; vr(vt.begin(), vt.end());
    std::sort(vr.begin(), vr.end());
    std::transform(vr.begin(), vr.end(),
        std::ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(std::cout), std::mem_fn(&amp;T::value_));
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/PscoPz">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<p>We observe that <code>sort_in_place</code> works nicely for <code>Dog</code>. Whenever <code>std::sort</code>
needs to compute <code>a &lt; b</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are <code>reference_wrapper&lt;Dog&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>,
it uses ADL to find our friend as a candidate, and then confirms that <code>reference_wrapper&lt;Dog&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>
is indeed implicitly convertible to <code>const Dog&lt;int&gt;&amp;</code> for both arguments.</p>

<p>But <code>sort_in_place</code> fails for <code>Cat</code>! It still uses ADL to find our <code>operator&lt;</code>
template; but then template argument deduction requires that the provided argument types
exactly match the pattern specified by the template, which is not true in this case —
there is no <code>V</code> such that <code>Cat&lt;V&gt;</code> is <code>reference_wrapper&lt;Cat&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>. Deduction fails.</p>

<p>We can manually call the proper specialization — the one with <code>V=int</code> — by writing
<code>operator&lt; &lt;int&gt;(vr[0], vr[1])</code>. (The space is important there!)
But we can’t write simply <code>vr[0] &lt; vr[1]</code> because of this poor interaction with
template argument deduction.</p>

<p>So <code>Dog</code>’s <code>operator&lt;</code> is better-designed than <code>Cat</code>’s, at least in this respect.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>For operator overloads, always prefer “hidden friend” non-templates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>main</em> benefits of the hidden friend idiom are that it avoids member operators’
asymmetrical treatment of the left and right operands, and that it shrinks overload sets
by not dumping free operators directly into the top-level namespace. This blog post
didn’t relate to either of those benefits.</p>

<p>The use of the hidden friend idiom in cases like <code>Dog</code> — specifically to create a
class template whose instantiations are associated with <em>non-template</em> friends —
is known as the “Barton–Nackman trick.” This blog post showed one way in which
the Barton–Nackman trick, specifically, provides a subtle benefit.</p>

<p>Even in C++20, STL containers generally use free templates instead of the Barton–Nackman trick,
which means that <code>sort_in_place</code> will, for example, <em>work</em> when <code>vt</code> is <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code>
but <em>fail</em> when <code>vt</code> is <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code>. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/x7nWhj">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<p>As far as I can remember, I’ve always had a disdain towards Apple products. Something about buying a laptop with poor thermals, a restrictive operating system, and a $1400 price tag just didn’t sit right with me. I was more content using my beat-up Thinkpad with Linux installed. </p>



<p>But 2020 has been an interesting year. So it would be fitting that 2020 would be the first year that I would venture out to buy a new laptop and somehow settle on choosing the new M1 Macbook Air. After using it for the past few weeks, I could not be happier. However, this got me thinking. How did Apple convince me (a staunch critic of Apple products) to buy a Mac?</p>



<p>After retracing my steps, I realized it was primarily due to their copywriting. As an engineer, I’ve only recently started to realize how important copywriting is when selling anything. Apple’s recent campaign around the new M1 Macs has been nothing short of spectacular and as engineers, I feel like there 2 key takeaways we all can learn from them. </p>



<h2>Talk About Impact And Not Numbers</h2>



<p>Two years ago I had just started my own startup that was highly technical. We were building computer vision algorithms to empower minimally trained medical professionals to do oral disease screenings. Our team was filled with engineers who were always striving to grow our accuracy so we could improve the value of our product. </p>



<p>This mentality carried over to our marketing materials, from our website to our sales deck. We had an accuracy of 85% which was about 15% more effective than the current incumbent, and we let everybody know. The number 85 was plastered over everything and we were proud of it. We even showed people how great our F1 Score was in relation to other medical AI companies. Our marketing was heavy on the numbers which we felt accurately demonstrated our product’s value. </p>



<p>However, it never really resonated with customers. Most doctors we were pitching to didn’t even know what an F1 score was. To see how to do numbers correctly we should look at the following marketing material:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg 1000w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-300x169.jpg 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-768x432.jpg 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-100x56.jpg 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-700x394.jpg 700w" data-sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></figure></div>



<p>Apple showed this graph at a recent event but notice how there are only 2 numbers on the screen. Even the graph has no clearly visible indicators on the y and x-axis (you really have to pay attention to what each axis represents). Instead, it shows the improvement in relation to other chips without blasting the crowd with a series of numbers. Now, this is how Apple communicates this improvement on their website when focusing on potential customers:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png" alt="Battery Copy Example" width="430" height="324" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png 1024w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-300x227.png 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-768x581.png 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1536x1161.png 1536w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-100x76.png 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-595x450.png 595w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1588x1200.png 1588w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1.png 1868w" data-sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"></figure></div>



<p>Now the Apple marketing team could have used this space to go into the specifics about the power draw of this new M1 chip and how it’s better than the old Intel chips. In fact, this move was wildly criticized by technical reviewers. Most notably Linus Tech Tips said that Apple’s unwillingness to release these specific numbers could be their downfall on this new Mac (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljApzn9YWmk">video link</a>). Yet this Mac has had a great reception and great sales. </p>



<p>So why did this marketing move work? Because Apple focused on how this better power consumption was going to solve the deeper emotional problems of their consumers. In one swift sentence, they were able to communicate 3 very key points. </p>



<p>With “Up to 18 hours of battery life. That’s 6 more hours, free of charge”, the Apple marketing team is able to show how this better battery consumption will increase the overall time you (as the consumer) have during a single charge but also clearly draws the competitive advantage by saying that is 6 hours more than their previous models/competitors. Finally, ending with “free of charge” lets us know that we aren’t going to paying more for this increased efficiency. It’s a powerful sentence that clearly conveys a technical topic like the M1 chip’s power consumption into something more digestible to your everyday consumer. </p>



<p>We see this work again in the following:</p>

<p>This new Mac has great thermals to the point where there is no fan in the Macbook air. However, even without a fan, there is no tradeoff with performance. Again, the Apple team could have used this time to speak about how hot the Macbook actually gets. They could have pulled an MKBHD and used a temperature gun to compare the temperature under different workloads and put this video on their site. Instead, they recognized the real problem is that most people hate the sound of their laptop’s fan cranking away while they are trying to get work done. So rather than getting into the weeds, Apple decided to step back and focus on what pain point they are solving. </p>



<p>How I’ve decided to apply this was taking a step back and every time I saw that we were using too many numbers, I thought critically about what issue we were solving with that number and replaced it with that. </p>



<p>For example, why did health systems care about our device having 85% accuracy? With higher accuracy, doctors were able to refer their patients with more confidence and improve health outcomes. We quickly changed our copywriting to reflect this sentiment. </p>



<h2>Talk Like A Human</h2>



<p>This is something that took me a long time to get past. After going through university, most of my writing became extremely formal. But the truth is no one speaks like that. However, when writing marketing materials, I feel like most engineers default to writing like they are trying to pass a university final rather than talk to a customer. </p>



<p>When you scroll down Apple’s website, it seems like someone is speaking to you. For example: </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-1024x452.png" alt="ML Copy Examplle
" width="694" height="306" srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-1024x452.png 1024w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-300x132.png 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-768x339.png 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-1536x678.png 1536w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-2048x904.png 2048w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-100x44.png 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-700x309.png 700w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-1600x706.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px"></figure></div>



<p>Now this is actually a pretty technical point that Apple is trying to get across. However, they are speaking to us, the consumer, in a super casual tone. They start out with a pretty number centric pitch. However, they quickly pivot to speaking about how this extra speed will help you with your day to day activities. During this part of the pitch, they sound like a normal person. </p>



<p>The light gray paragraph is filled with shortened words (like pro vs. professional) and run-on sentences. They use casual language like “That’s” and casual terminology like “brain power”. If I wrote like this while doing my undergrad ethics class I’m sure I wouldn’t have passed. However, when you see any company writing like this it humanizes them. </p>



<p>This gave me flashbacks to 2 related moments during my freshman year during school. The first moment came when I was walking into my engineering library and saw a desk set up in the entryway. Two students stood in front of it hawking a new app that lets you get discounts on food within Green Street (the most popular street at UIUC). Since they were near the staircase, I had to listen briefly to their spiel before grabbing a brochure and leaving. I never downloaded that app and it soon went under so I’m assuming most people also didn’t download the app. The second moment came my junior year where during a party, a friend of a friend mentioned how he was using this brand new app on campus which let him see food deals. I had built up enough rapport with this stranger where I thought it would be worth checking out this app so I downloaded it that night. I later came to find out that guy was a campus ambassador for that app and it was his job to get students on the app. Even after finding that out, I still kept the app. </p>



<p>So why did I download the app the second time and not the first? Because the first time, I was in a situation where I felt like I was being sold something. Those campus ambassadors had a script and they stuck to it. The second time, I wasn’t actually being sold anything but rather listening to a guy talk about his experience on the app. The difference was very noticeable. In the first case, they were rattling off numbers about how much money I could save while in the second case, the ambassador told me stories about how he got 30 chicken nuggets for 6 dollars or how he was able to get a free meal for his date after finding a buy 1 get 1 free offer at a local burrito joint. </p>



<p>This can be applied to copywriting. The difference between bad and good copywriting is the ability to make it not sound like a sales pitch. If people feel like they are trying to be sold something, they are more likely to put up a wall and not buy anything. As an engineer, I try to write about what I’m working on like I’m telling my friend about it. That way it’s always more personable. Remember, people don’t like being sold to. </p>



<hr>



<p>Apple does a great job of technical copywriting. Their teams are great at taking complex technical advantages and condensing them down into something more understandable. I think we can all learn from them and apply some of their methods to our own side projects. As the saying goes – <em>“Good artists make, great artists steal”</em></p>

      <h2>What's all this, then?</h2>
      <p><strong>BLABRECS</strong> is a rules modification for the wordgame SCRABBLE that swaps out the dictionary of real-if-obscure English words for a capricious artificial intelligence. In BLABRECS, real English words aren't allowed! Instead, you have to play nonsense words that <em>sound</em> like English to the AI. These nonsense words are called – you guessed it – BLABRECS.</p>
      <h2>How do I play?</h2>
      <p>Get together your regular SCRABBLE supplies and pull up this page in a web browser. Then play SCRABBLE as normal, but before you play a word, use the "test a word..." box at the top of the page to check whether the AI will let you play it. Remember, you can only play words that the AI approves!</p>
      <p>When you find a legal word to play, hit the "Play It" button to add this word to the lexicon. As you play, you can write in definitions for all the words you've invented in the "Meaning" textbox next to each word. The player who comes up with the best definition for a word can add half of that word's points to their SCRABBLE score at the end of the game.</p>
      <h2>I found a real word that the AI thinks is playable! What should I do?</h2>
      <p>This happens often with proper nouns (which SCRABBLE generally disallows) and with inflected forms of base words that are disallowed. I think you should play by the spirit of BLABRECS and not the letter, but what this means is ultimately up to you. Is the game primarily about exploring the vast "shadow English" implied by the statistical distribution of letter sequences, or is it about the inherent absurdity of an external authority presuming to dictate your language to you? Either interpretation seems valid to me.</p>
      <h2>How does the AI work?</h2>
      <p>Right now it uses a Markov model trained on the <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/">ENABLE word list</a> used in a number of wordgames. It looks at the statistical patterns of letter sequences in English words and uses this information to determine how likely a sequence of letters is to be a real English word. Then it rejects both real dictionary words and fake words that it deems insufficiently plausible. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mkremins/blabrecs">source code</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
      <p>I might update BLABRECS to provide a wider range of AI "opponents" using a variety of different technologies in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
      <h2>Why is it called BLABRECS?</h2>
      <p>I generated every possible permutation of the word SCRABBLE and asked an early version of the AI to sort them from least to most statistically likely. BRABLECS won out by a significant margin, beating not only the real word SCRABBLE but also my hand-designed previous title BESCRALB. Then I switched the L and the R because BLABRECS sounds better and I'm not about to let a computer tell me what to do.</p>
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
      <p>I'm <a href="https://mkremins.github.io/">Max Kreminski</a>, an artifical intelligence researcher and game designer. At the time of this release (December 2020), I'm working on my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

<p>I wasn’t really paying attention, so maybe I’m the only one that hadn’t noticed, but Tesla’s market cap as of December 9th 2020 is a touch over 616 billion US dollars. That makes it kind of a big deal. In fact, it accounts for a full third of the global automaker market cap:</p>







<p>Just for a bit of context – Tesla only listed on the stock market 10 years ago (June 2010). The company itself was only founded in 2003. Compare that to Ford which launched in 1903 and basically invented the concept of mass production (the Model T is still one of the best selling cars of all time) or Benz in 1889, whose founder, Karl Benz, literally had a patent on the original goddamn automobile. </p>



<p>Here’s a racing bar chart of a few of the top automakers share prices over the last couple of decades. Tesla both literally and figuratively comes out of nowhere (spoiler alert: things get insane in 2019):</p>







<p>As you can see from the chart, the share price has pretty much 10x’d over the last 12 months. Why? Well, it’s certainly not because Tesla is making 10 times the revenue or shipping 10 times as many cars. In all of 2019, for example, Tesla shipped 367,500 cars. In Q3, 2020, they shipped 139,300 cars, giving them a run rate of around 550,000 cars for the entire year. For context, <strong>Toyota sold 927,623 cars in October 2020 alone</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/profile/production-sales-figures/" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>



<p>Here’s how Tesla compares to some of the automakers mentioned above in terms of yearly car sales:</p>







<p>No, I didn’t forget to add Tesla to the chart – you just can’t see the label because of how tiny the sales numbers are relative to other automakers (it’s that little blue sliver between Volkswagen and BMW if you still haven’t found it).</p>



<p>As you’d expect from the huge disparity in car sales shown above, Tesla’s revenues are also dwarfed by the bigger incumbents. Expected 2020 revenues are around 28 billion USD – impressive, but more than an order of magnitude less than VW’s 299 billion USD in 2019. </p>







<p>So why does the market have such a hard on for Tesla? As the chart above shows, Tesla’s market cap seems to be completely out of whack with its revenues and earnings (the latter was just 10 million USD in 2019). </p>



<p>The simple answer is that the market is valuing the VW’s, Toyota’s, and Daimler’s of the world on what they are – car companies. Tesla, on the other hand, is being valued as a tech business, and therefore what it *could* be. Car companies are boring and predictable. Technology companies though… Well, they have pretty much unlimited upside, don’t they?</p>



<p>Here are a few things Tesla has going for it.</p>



<ul><li>First, and most obviously, the electric car market is really just getting started. There are close to 100 million new cars per year sold globally, and less than 1% of them are electric, though this number is growing quickly – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-electric-idUSKBN27C08C">it’s already 5% in China</a> – and expected to surpass 50% in most developed nations by 2030. There is even some talk of the UK and EU <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/build-back-greener-boris-johnson-bans-petrol-cars-by-2030-20201119-p56fwn.html" target="_blank">banning sales</a> of new petrol and diesel cars in the not too distant future.<p>Tesla clearly has a first mover advantage here, and a lead on battery technology and EV engineering, though the quantum of this lead is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-technology-electric-vehicles-engineering-51592842119" target="_blank">disputed</a>. </p></li><li>Tesla may be the first company to actually nail self-driving. After overpromising and underdelivering for years (in 2015, Musk predicted FSD could arrive by 2018), Tesla Full Self Driving appears to have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" target="_blank">launched in beta</a> for some drivers, though early reports of its reliability are mixed.<br></li><li>Revenue growth to date. Sure, as we can see in the above chart, total revenues are still only a fraction of VW’s and Toyota’s, but 10 years ago Tesla had revenues of 100m USD compared to 2020’s projected 28B USD – that’s a roughly 28 fold increase. In the same period, VW’s revenue has increased by about 75%, and Toyota’s by only around 30%.<br></li><li>Well placed in solar and home energy storage. <br></li><li>The Tesla brand is cool, the Elon Musk brand is cool </li></ul>



<p>And finally, Tesla is, for pretty much the first time in its history doing something many of its critics said it would never do – <strong>actually turning a profit</strong>. The 10 million USD profit it made in 2019 was for all intents and purposes breaking even (and was driven largely by sale of regulatory credits), but in 2020 expected profits are a meaty looking 1.26B USD.</p>
