              <p>Hi from the team who built the "mesonet" weather station networks in the state of South Australia!</p>
              <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonet">mesonet</a> is a term for a network of automated weather stations designed to monitor meteorological phenomena at high geographic density and updated frequently.</p>
              <p>We built these networks to help prevent pesticide <a href="#spraydrift">spray drift</a> - the phenomenon in which pesticide spray that is applied to a crop ends up drifting to other crops, sometimes many kilometres away.</p>
              <p>Spray drift can be a huge problem, as it can lead to damage or even destruction of highly valuable crops, and can also cause pollution to waterways and harm to native ecosystems.</p>
              <p>The biggest factor in spray drift the presence of a <a href="#thermalinversions">thermal inversion</a>, a state in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, which usually happens in the evening and overnight when the earth is cooling, but can happen at other times. However other meteorological phenomena also affect the likelihood of spray drift, and different types of spray respond differently.</p>
              <p>So we designed a <a href="#ourweatherstations">weather station</a> to measure all the relevant meteorological phenomena, and in particular to detect thermal inversions, and a custom <a href="#webapp">web app</a> to display the data in format that is very fast and simple to access and understand.</p>
              <p>We've now deployed 70 of these stations across two of the major agricultural regions of South Australia, and so far it seems to be making a difference: no damage due to spray drift has been reported in these regions since the networks were rolled out.</p>


              

              <a name="background"><h2>Background</h2></a>

              <p>A group of stakeholders in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North">Mid North region of South Australia</a> had identified spray drift as a major issue.</p>
              <p>The region, to the north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia">South Australia</a>'s capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, has a thriving agricultural sector, producing wheat, barley, wine grapes, pulses, livestock and other produce.</p>
              <p>The total annual output from the region is valued at nearly AUD $2 billion. It has been estimated that the potential loss in production from spray drift could be as high as $178M/year, and potential harm to waterways and native ecosystems is significant.</p>
              <p>The local stakeholders worked with meteorologists and researchers to develop a solution, then sought funding from the South Australia state government to fund the project.</p>
              <p>In 2018, a $1.4M grant was provided, and a pilot rollout of 40 weather stations was undertaken.  It was named the Mid North Mesonet.</p>
              <p>The pilot was deemed successful, and in 2019, another grant was provided by the state government for a network in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverland">Riverland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Mallee">Mallee</a> region to the north-east of Adelaide.</p>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was rolled out, there have been no reported instances of crop damage due spray drift.</p>

              <a name="spraydrift"><h2>The Problem of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>Farmers spray pesticides on their crops to manage pests. It is an important feature of modern farming. Herbicide may be applied to target broad-leaf plants, other times to target summer weeds.</p>
              <p>Spray drift occurs when pesticide spray 'drifts' across into non-target areas.</p>
              <p>Spray drift is a problem because:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The affected non-target area may be particularly susceptible to pesticides (i.e. broad-leaf crops such as grapevines are especially vulnerable)</li>
                    <li>Some markets are highly sensitive to the amount of pesticide residues detectable in the end products (i.e. wine exports to China; organic farms; etc)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might be a sensitive natural ecosystem (i.e. local waterways)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might include rain water tanks used for drinking water</li>
                    <li>It is a waste of pesticide product and labour time costs</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <a name="causesofspraydrift"><h2>Causes of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>A combination of conditions can lead to spray drift.</p>
              <h3>Wind Speed</h3>
              <p>Wind speed that is very low or very high.</p>
              <h3>Temperature</h3>
              <p>A temperature over about 28°C (83°F).</p>
              <h3>Humidity</h3>
              <p>The effect of humidity varies depending on the type of spray. The spray manufacturer's instructions should provide guidance.</p>
              <h3>Atmospheric Stability</h3>
              <p><i>Unstable</i> or <i>stable</i> conditions can lead to spray drift. Conditions should be <i>neutral.</i></p>
              <h3>Thermal Inversions</h3>
              <p>A thermal inversion, in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, is a major risk factor for spray drift.</p>
              <p>Inversions generally happen in the evening and overnight as the earth cools, but they can happen at other times.</p>

              <a name="thermalinversions"><h2>Thermal Inversions</h2></a>
              <p>For current farming practices, long-distance spray drift generally occurs during very stable weather conditions (i.e. little to no air turbulence).</p>
              <p>A thermal inversion occurs when a warm layer of air sits above a cooler layer of air near the ground.</p>
              <p>This reduces air turbulence and can act as a ‘lid’ for an airborne pollutant source. The lack of air turbulence means the smaller spray droplets float without settling on the target crops.</p>
              <p>A very slight breeze can then carry these floating droplets large distances before they eventually descend into a non-target area.</p>
              <p>It is illegal to spray during a thermal inversion.</p>

              <p><strong>The problem: it is very difficult for farmers to tell if a thermal inversion is underway.</strong></p>

                    <li>Measure temperature at 1.2m and 10m, in order to detect inversions</li>
                    <li>Measure all weather metrics that are relevant in determining whether it is safe to spray</li>

              <a name="webapp"><h2>The Web Application</h2></a>

              <p>We initially used an off-the-shelf web application for displaying meteorological data, but soon realised we needed something tailored to our needs. We found a company that was already in the business of building web-applications to display environmental data for farmers, and they were willing to build a customised version for us.</p>

              <p>The key requirements for the application were:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of the monitored metrics displayed on a map, with fast/simple switching between each metric</li>
                    <li>A dashboard of all the current key metrics and recent historical graphs</li>
                    <li>Long-term graphs of all the key metrics also available, and as well as the past 48 hours of data in tabular format</li>
                    <li>The site must display well and be easy to use on a mobile device, and be fast to use even in areas with low cellular signal strength, given that much of the usage will be by farmers out in the field in remote areas.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>The key technologies are:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Redis</li>
                    <li>Sidekiq for queue processing</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>Data is uploaded from the data logger via FTP (which may seem primitive, but the world of meteorological data still relies heavily on FTP).</p>

              <p>On detection of new data, the application first takes the most recent readings, and updates the data structures for the map and dashboard views.</p>

              <p>The historical data is then placed in a queue, for updating of historical graphs.</p>

              <p>All the data for the map view, dashboards and historical graphs are formatted into a JSON hash then serialized and stored in the Redis cache. That way, when the React web interface makes a request, the pre-formatted data can be retrieved and sent very quickly, as no querying, processing or formatting of data is required at request time.</p>

              <a name="results"><h2>Results so far</h2></a>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was deployed, there have been no reported cases of crop damage due to spray drift.</p>

              <p>Damage and loss had been reported in most of the previous years - though not all. So it is too early to tell if the problem has been completely solved, but indications are promising.</p>

              <p>Other government bodies and NGOs are expressing interest in establishing their own mesonets.</p>

<p><em>Update: There’s a <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/is-domain-driven-design-overrated/">slightly extended version of this post</a> over at the INNOQ company blog.</em></p>
<p>There, I said it. Now that I have your attention: Domain Driven Design (DDD) has recently gained additional popularity, as evidenced by new books, conference talks (and even complete conferences dedicated to it), and lots of trainings – including some by our very own colleagues at <a href="https://www.innoq.com/">INNOQ</a>. And in contrast to my click-bait headline, I’m actually a fan. <a href="https://www.dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">Eric Evans’s book</a>, the additional work writing and evangelizing it done by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.com/">Vaughn Vernon</a> (e.g. in <a href="https://www.case-podcast.org/15-domain-driven-design-with-vaughn-vernon">this very good podcast</a> with my colleague Joy) and many others, are all very good additions to our industry’s body of knowledge. In the best sense of pattern languages, DDD gives clear names to things that many developers and designers know how to do, but cannot reliably and compatibly communicate about.</p>
<p>But I’m annoyed by the fact that recently, it seems that any time somebody talks about how to architect system or service boundaries, or even just mentions non-technical design, everybody feels compelled to bring in the DDD experts – as if they were the only superheroes who could possibly design anything at all. This is just as bad as any other situation where you blindly apply the solution that’s currently en vogue, just because it is the thing everyone talks about, and not because it is the right solution for the job. DDD is great, but it’s just one of many tools and techniques you should be aware of.</p>
<p>I think there is a more important aspect that people miss, especially when they get into DDD as their introduction to design in general. DDD emphasizes the importance of naming, and it suggests you should strive for a common, ubiquitous language, in the context you’re designing for. But it also uses its own language – concepts like bounded context, aggregates, entities, value objects, etc. – for our domain, the domain of designing systems. And while these are all well and good, they’re only one possible language. There’s value in calling a value object a value object, if this is a term many people understand, to facilitate communication. But the existing, common DDD concepts are not the only concepts you should consider – they are just examples of a very common trait of designing and architecting systems: Coming up with and recognizing patterns, giving them good names, and using them to give the system structure and integrity. If in your architecture, there’s a common pattern that you use a Filter to route requests to a Handler, or a concept of a Document that is handled by an Agent, then these things may occur again and again, on the same level as Services or Repositories, and end up being way more important to you. This is fine! This concept, that we can and should invent our own languages, is to me way more important than many naïve DDD practitioners think. I like to believe that DDD experts know this very well, and view any DDD material as a starting point, not an end result – but if all you’re doing is applying the by-the-book definition of existing DDD terms, and trying to shoe-horn any problem into this existing structure, yours is a very sad designer’s life.</p>
<p>There is a life beyond DDD. Not every good design needs to be Domain-Driven (though I can accept it should always be driven by the domain, just not necessarily in the DDD sense). You can design good systems even if you’re not a DDD expert.</p>

<p>Do you remember your first time using a modern smartphone? A vibrant screen that responded instantly when you tapped replaced cramped keyboards. You could sign your name, drag and drop apps around the screen, and even spin the giant Price is Right wheel to set your alarm. In 2007, this felt like a the future. There's a reason it was called 'the Jesus phone.'</p>
<p>At that same time, The Motorola Razr (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_IK295sfxQ">video</a>) was the top phone on the market. It was a flip phone with the ability to take photos, play videos, browse the web, and play music. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Phones in 2007 had the same features as the iPhone. The Palm Treo (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK7FvGz4Jkc">video</a>) even had a touch screen.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/smartphones-2007.png">
<p>The difference was <em>speed</em>.</p>
<p>When you touched a Razr or a Palm phone, there was a delay. It felt sluggish and slow. Apple removed the delay between your finger tapping the screen and something happening. Your finger could finally manipulate the UI in realtime, just like in the real world. It felt magical. If there was even a slight delay, the whole experience fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Speed is a killer feature. Speed is a differentiator.</strong></p>
<p>Yet teams consistently overlook speed. Instead, they add more features (which ironically make things slower). Products bloat over time and performance goes downhill.</p>
<p>New features might help your users accomplish something extra in your product.
<strong>Latency stops your users from doing the job they already hire your product for.</strong></p>
<p>Slow ui acts like tiny papercuts. Every time we have to wait, we get impatient, frustrated, and lose our flow.</p>
<h2>Honestly assess your speed</h2>
<p>I want you to take a moment and approach your product with a fresh set of eyes: Eyes for speed  👀</p>
<p>Go through your onboarding flow and try your core product features. Take mental note of how long each step takes to appear on the page then to be interactive.</p>
<p>How slow is it?
Be honest.
It’s ok, I’ve been there too.</p>
<p>Does your checkout page take 10+ seconds to load? Did you have to wait for a loading indicator multiple times along the way? Did things look interactive but weren’t loaded yet?</p>
<p>Every one of these is an opportunity. The great thing about speed (also called ‘performance’) is that you can stack rank it and burn it down.</p>
<p>Imagine what your product would feel like if everything happened in real time.</p>
<p><img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/speed-keanu-sandra.png"></p><p>Be like Keanu and fix every slowdown in your product. Your users will thank you.</p>
<h2>Places where speed matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speed during Checkout - Every second of page load time kills conversion rates. A 1 second delay <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/">reduces conversion rate by 7%</a>.</li>
<li>Framerate in Virtual Reality - The early days of Virtual Reality caused intense nausea akin to motion sickness <a href="https://link.medium.com/QyheLe9rbeb">when framerates dropped below 60fps</a>.</li>
<li>Design Tools - Users are consistently frustrated when Sketch or Figma are slow. <a href="https://quizlet.com/blog/everything-i-know-about-design">Designers have high APM</a> (actions per minute) and a small slowdown can occur 5-10 times per minute.</li>
<li>The core interaction of your product - Your product exists to save people time or help them solve a problem. Introducing friction or delay during the most important flow of your product will drive people crazy. Notion has developed a reputation for being a sluggish product:</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/reddit-notion.png">
<h2>Perception vs. Reality</h2>
<p>If you can’t speed up a specific action, you can often fake it. Perceived speed is just as important as actual speed. Even if you can’t be fast, you should appear to be fast.</p>
<p><strong>Large content</strong> - Render the screen while content loads so the user knows what’s coming.
<strong>Long load times</strong> - Make the screen interactive, even if everything hasn’t loaded.
<strong>Waiting for an action</strong> - Allow the user to take the action and keep moving but post the action in the background.
<strong>Very long actions</strong> - If you have an action that will take 30s or more, offer to notify the user (e.g. via email) when the action is available.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of products that fake being fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook’s app pioneered loading images that look like actual content. The structure and UI of the page loads but the content does not. As a result, you can still use the product and prepare to take actions, even if the content hasn’t loaded.</li>
<li>Games have a rule to never block the input thread. You can slow down the visuals but the controls should always feel responsive so the user feels in control.</li>
<li>Robinhood has you swipe up to trade, but runs your transaction in the background and notifies you via email when your trade is complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When is it ok to be slow?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When there is a physical constraint that causes things to take a while (e.g. dispensing money from an ATM)</li>
<li>When you want to give people a chance to correct a mistake (e.g. Gmail's "undo" feature)</li>
<li>When a human has to keep up with a machine (e.g. we slow down video game framerates, otherwise the game would run at 60x speed and overwhelm you).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Fun: What would it be like to live with lag?</h2>
<p>Imagine making breakfast with a 1 second latency added to every action you take. Even something as simple as moving your hands so that an egg rests over a bowl becomes incredibly challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a real life experiment where 0.5-3s of latency was added to everyone's action via a VR headset:</strong></p>

<p>This is what we're forcing on people when we ship laggy software. We're making them spend their time waiting for us.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
      
      <div><p>We’ve launched a brand new version of Element, called <a href="https://element.io/element-home">Element Home</a>!<br></p><p>It’s the Element app, but faster, personalised and under your control - all packaged up so you don’t have to worry about how it works! You can just enjoy the fact you know you chose someone you trust (us!) with your data.<br></p><p>So that you know, here’s what’s going on behind the scenes with Element Home; in practice you’re getting your own fully managed, dedicated server alongside your Element app. It means you have a notably faster service than when using a typical free public server - you’re saved the hassle of self-hosting and it’s guaranteed to be kept updated with the very latest and greatest Matrix hosting best practices.<br></p><div><p>On top of faster messaging, Element Home comes with five user accounts. It’s the ideal way for a family, or groups of friends, to get a super-quick professionally hosted version of Element.</p><p><strong>A new type of messenger</strong></p></div><p>As you know, Element is completely different to most messaging apps. <br></p><p>Because Element is <strong>decentralised</strong>, the app itself (what you see) is separate from the Matrix hosting service behind it (what you don’t see; the movement of messages and where they are stored).<br></p><p>That’s important because it lets users decide where their messages and data are kept. In owning that choice, you also get to own your data and messages rather than having them sucked up into the likes of Facebook Messenger, Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp.<br></p><p>Some people choose to host themselves, and that’s great. As it requires some technical knowledge, many others choose to use a free public hosting service such as Matrix.org to get up and running.<br></p><p>Element Home is a third option; the ability to pay for a fully managed, dedicated server (aka a ‘homeserver’). Being a dedicated server, it devotes itself to just a handful of users; and that’s why it’s so much quicker than a typical free public server that constantly juggles thousands of users.</p><p><strong>There are many messaging apps, but surprisingly little choice.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 2108w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Element compared with centralised messaging apps.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Free vs $10 per month</strong><br></p><p>As you know, Element and Matrix is all about giving you choice. If you want to use the free version, that’s completely fine by us!<br></p><p>But here’s the extra you get in return for a few bucks a month:<br></p><ol><li>Element Home means you’re <strong>hosted by Element Matrix Services</strong> - our Matrix-based hosting platform used by big companies and public sector organisations. You have a <strong>dedicated server</strong> (so you’re sharing minimal infrastructure with anyone else), fully managed and maintained by the most Matrix-savvy team in the world.<br></li><li>Professional-hosting means the service is <strong>notably faster</strong> than when hosted by a typical free public server, and <strong>always fully updated</strong> and maintained.<br></li><li>An Element domain that you can name, so you can make <strong>memorable Matrix IDs</strong> such as @yourfirstname:yoursurname.ems.host. Use your surname as the domain, and it’s perfect for family sharing!<br></li><li><strong>Five Element accounts</strong> - so after using one yourself, you’ll have four more for family or friends - so that’s <strong>just $2 per user per month</strong> for a super-quick data sovereign messaging service (you can add more users if you wish).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Matching IDs for all the family!</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wishing you could turn back time?!</strong></p><p>If you’re an Element user and you’re self-hosting, or using a typical free public server (such as Matrix.org), you can simply copy your existing account over to Element Home. Currently, you can only do this in the Element web app (we’re working on an equally simple upgrade from within Android and iOS). Once you’ve upgraded your ‘old’ account will still be live, so feel free to keep it or delete it as you see fit.<br></p><p>For those not already up and running on Element, just <a href="https://element.io/element-home">sign up for Element Home</a> from here.</p></div>

<![CDATA[How to Read Assembly Language]]>

March 1, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location
(like the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a>
statement), or calling or returning from a function. (The x86
architecture has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">lots of not-so-small
instructions</a>
as well. Some of these are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5959890/enter-vs-push-ebp-mov-ebp-esp-sub-esp-imm-and-leave-vs-mov-esp-ebp">legacy
cruft</a>
built up over the 40-odd years of the architecture’s existence, and
others are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">newfangled
additions</a>. )</p><p>Our first toy example will get us acquainted with simple
instructions. It just calculates the square of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">norm</a>
of a 2D vector:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and here is the resulting x86_64 assembly from clang 11, <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tQVvQAZPLUwA5YwCNMxEADZSAB1QLC62nsMTQS8fNTorG3sjJxd3JRUw2gYCZmICAONTTkVlTFU/ZNSCCLtHZzdFFLSMoOyFKuLrUujy1wBKRVQDYmQOAHIpAGZrZEMsAGpxQZ1kevx6KexxAAYAQRXV%2BuIDVXGANTzJSYB2WTXxi/HrAlduAH0CcYAPKbPVy6v6W4fxgE9XjbiY4AEQBaw212%2Bj1oJCMDAAjgZUph0BADsgjgA3NonN4fYiYAjdWjjTEAOie4wAVKSKZMZLTftTGWD1iC%2Bh1WCA%2BgBWPqkUx9Zb81DcnRyOTjBRdHqYemDTj8gjc4VtDoAaxAg0GZO1ev1BvcXL63H5guFpFFfX5ChAy1IyqFHNIcFgSDQRg8eHYZAoEA9Xp9KGEok4nGW2So3oIzltEAcKv5DmsqV%2B3MVpA9Ri0BAA8rRWGmnaQsEYRMB2ImS3gCflMZhbcXME88gYY%2Bn%2BddlB2hHgHMRU3osD2CMQ8EYOx0aPQmGwODx%2BIIQ2IJTJew5bZAOqgPIlGwBaXODcb7uZTYESGRySQW%2BJ5RKabQ1LKkcwlKIxYLeXx0Z9f0J%2BO%2BZQuHUuT5HQhTVPomSCHe4FJA0QEtCBlRFH%2BdSIU0H7lJwHTSt0vRcJy3J8gKVZWk8AAcrj7rc4yjOW4xhmSyxkpw4wQLghAkPK2TjHonres4vE4uKV4yEqiZqqQmrarqBoKdqRrcqaZHFlaNp2g6UkujAiAoKggk%2BuQlABkJLgMaG4aRtGsaUAmxbJrQqY9lmOb5oWValuWlbFvgtZqPWjYWs2rbtn0GZdsaFqsH2A7EL8Q79Bao7jpOpDTowLCVguAiSEI5YoKu8ixRu8DbrufgHkeJ5noMF7FTeNpgQ%2BEDmOhr7aEhn7ZCEP7%2BNBtSeN%2BiTdThOQJAUDQdXBiSQY0kTAbB02DS%2B9RFGNIF4TKhG4UIJFmuR3JUTRdGWcATGcCxbEcVxRDELxpD8YZgbCUMkiicVklOtJsk6opin7Sah3qdymn2o6qrEX0kggxaGnaT9HT1sQPgaNwQA%3D%3D">via Compiler Explorer</a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>imulq</span>   %rdi, %rdi
        <span>imulq</span>   %rsi, %rsi
        <span>leaq</span>    (%rsi,%rdi), %rax
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
<span>    <span>void</span> <span>debugPrint</span>() <span>const</span>;
</span>};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
<span>    v.debugPrint();

some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function

smallish strings.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We might write something like

</span></code></pre></div><p>Our function prologue has gotten a lot longer, and we have some new
control flow instructions as well. Let’s take a closer look at the
prologue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>pushq</span>   %rbp
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbp
        <span>pushq</span>   %r15
        <span>pushq</span>   %r14
        <span>pushq</span>   %rbx
        <span>pushq</span>   %rax
        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Finally, we save our first argument (<code>%rdi</code>) in <code>%r14</code>.</p><p>On to the function body. We call <code>strlen(s)</code> with <code>callq strlen</code> and
store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch
to <code>.LBB0_2</code> was not taken. We have a blob of instructions to create
<code>char temp[sSize + 1]</code> on the stack:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %r15
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbx
        <span>addq</span>    <span>$15</span>, %rdi
        <span>andq</span>    <span>$-16</span>, %rdi
        <span>subq</span>    %rdi, %rbx
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rsp
</code></pre></div><p>We save <code>%rsp</code> to <code>%r15</code> and <code>%rbx</code> for later
use.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Then, we add 15 to <code>%rdi</code> (which,
remember, contains the size of our array), mask off the lower 4 bits
with <code>andq $-16, %rdi</code>, and subtract the result from <code>%rbx</code>, which we
then put back into <code>%rsp</code>. In short, this rounds the array size up to
the next multiple of 16 bytes and makes space for it on the stack.</p><p>The following block simply calls <code>copyUppercase</code> and <code>puts</code> as written in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>movq</span>    %r14, %rsi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>copyUppercase</span>(<span>char</span>*, <span>char</span> <span>const</span>*)
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>puts</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we have our function epilogue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %r15, %rsp
        <span>leaq</span>    -<span>24</span>(%rbp), %rsp
        <span>popq</span>    %rbx
        <span>popq</span>    %r14
        <span>popq</span>    %r15
        <span>popq</span>    %rbp
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We restore the stack pointer to deallocate our variable-length array
using <code>leaq</code>. Then, we <code>popq</code> the registers we saved during the
function prologue and return control to our caller, and we are done.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the path when <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code> and we branch to
<code>.LBB0_2</code>. This path is more …</p></div></div></div>

            <h2>What is Literate Programming?</h2>
            <p>Literate programming is a style of programming invented by Donald Knuth, where the main idea is
            that a program's source code is made primarily to be read and understood by other people, and
            secondarily to be executed by the computer.</p>
            
            <p>This frees the programmer from the structure of a program imposed by the computer and means that
            the programmer can develop programs in the order of the flow of their thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>A Literate program consists of explanation of the code in a natural language such as English, interspersed
            with snippets of code to be executed. This means that Literate programs are very easy to understand and share,
            as all the code is well explained.</p>
            
            <p>Literate, a tool for literate programming, will allow you to take a literate source file (<code>*.lit</code>) and
            either <em>tangle</em> the source file which will create a file with executable code, or <em>weave</em> the
            source file, which will generate an HTML document to be read as formatted documentation.</p>

            <!-- What are the features of lit -->
            <h2>Features of this tool</h2><p>
            Literate works with any programming language, generates HTML as output (<a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/">which can be converted to pdf</a>),
            and generates readable code. The code that is generated is indented properly and is automatically commented using the titles you have written
            for the code blocks.</p><p>
            Here is the full list of features:</p><ul>
                <li>Supports any language including syntax highlighting and pretty printing in HTML</li>
                <li>Generates HTML as output</li>
                <li>Generates readable code and commented in the target language</li>
                <li>Reports syntax errors back from the compiler to the right line in the literate source</li>
                <li>Runs fast -- wc.lit compiled for me in 7ms for both code and html output</li>
                <li>Markdown based -- very easy to read and write Literate source.</li>
                <li>Automatically generates hyperlinks between code sections</li>
                <li>Formatted output similar to CWEB</li>
                <li>Creates an index with identifiers used (you need to have exuberant or universal ctags installed to use this feature)</li>
                <li>Supports TeX equations with <code>$</code> notation</li>
                <li>Compatible with Vim (<a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/literate.vim" target="_blank">literate.vim</a>)</li>
                <li>Highly customizable</li>
            </ul><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. government has asked Google to fork over granular data on how its search engine works and is monetized, seeking to prove that the internet giant is a monopoly.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are seeking comparable data on U.S. search results and related ad from Feb. 2, 2015 to Feb. 8, 2015 and from Feb. 3, 2020 to Feb. 9, 2020, according to a legal filing Monday.</p>

<p>The Alphabet Inc. unit is being asked to share data on how and where users searched in those periods, the quantity of different types of ads, revenue from those ads and what the underlying bids were for them, among other details. The government told the company it wants the information within 30 days.</p>

<p>The Justice Department under former U.S. President Donald Trump and 11 Republican attorneys general originally filed the suit. Three other states have since joined, including California, the site of Googleâ€™s headquarters. The latest data request shows the government is pressing ahead under a new administration led by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The U.S. government alleges Googleâ€™s exclusive deals to distribute its search engine on browsers and phones, including Apple Inc.â€™s iPhones, violates the Sherman Actâ€™s prohibition on monopolization. Itâ€™s the most significant U.S. monopoly case since the one against Microsoft Corp. more than 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Google has said its deals donâ€™t prevent consumers from switching to other search providers. The company argues its success rests on superior technology.</p>

<p>In this post, I will focus on <strong>gradients of image signals defined on grids</strong> in computer graphics and image processing. Specifically, gradients / derivatives of images, height fields, distance fields, when they are represented as discrete, uniform grids of pixels or voxels.</p>



<p>I’ll start with the very basics – what do we typically mean by gradients (as it’s not always “standardized”), what are they used for, what are the ypical methods (forward or central differences), their cons and problems, and then proceed to discuss an interesting alternative with very nice properties – <strong>diagonal gradients</strong>.</p>



<p>My post will conclude with advice on how to use them in practice in a simple useful scheme, how to extend it with a little bit of computations to a super useful concept of a <strong>structure tensor</strong> that can characterize dominating direction of any gradient field, and finish with some signal processing fun – <strong>frequency domain analysis </strong>of forward and central differences.</p>



<h2>Image gradients</h2>



<p>What are image gradients or derivatives? How do you define gradients on a grid?</p>



<p>It’s not very well defined problem on discrete signals, but the most common and useful way to think about it is inspired by signal processing and the idea of sampling:</p>



<p><strong>Assuming there was some continuous signal that got discretized, what would be the partial derivative with regards to the spatial dimension of this continuous signal at gradient evaluation points?</strong></p>



<p>This interpretation is useful both for computer graphics (where we might have discretized descriptions of continuous surfaces; like voxel fields, heightmaps, or distance fields), as well as in image processing (where we often assume that images are “natural images” that got photographed).</p>



<p>Continuous gradients and derivatives used for things like normals of procedural SDFs are also interesting, but a different story. I will not cover those here, and instead recommend you check out <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/normalsSDF/normalsSDF.htm">this cool post</a> by Inigo Quilez with lots of practical tricks (re-reading it I learned about the tetrahedron trick) and advice. I am sure that no matter your level of familiarity with the topic, you will learn something new.</p>



<p>In my post, I will focus on computer graphics, image processing, and basic signal processing takes on the problem. There are two much deeper connections that I haven’t personally worked too much with. So I leave it as something that I wish I can expand my knowledge in the future, but also encourage my readers to explore it:</p>



<p><strong>Further reading one:</strong> The first connection is with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation">Partial Differential Equations</a> and their discretization. Solving PDEs and solving discretized PDEs is something that many specialized scientific domains deal with, and computing gradients is an inherent part of numerical discretized PDE solutions. I don’t know too much about those, but I’m sure literature covers this in much detail.</p>



<p><strong>Further reading two:</strong> The second connection is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet">wavelets</a>, filter banks, and the frequency precision / localization trade-off. This is something used in communication theory, electrical engineering, radar systems, audio systems, and many more. While I read and am familiar with <em>some </em>theory, I haven’t found too many practical uses of wavelets (other than the simplest Gabor ones or in use for image pyramids) in my work, so again I’ll just recommend you some more specialized reading.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Applications</h2>



<p>Ok, why would we want to compute gradients? Two common uses:</p>



<p><strong>Compute surface normals </strong>– when we have something like a scalar field – whether distance field describing an underlying implicit surface, or simply a height field, we might want to compute its gradients to compute normals of the surface, or of the heightfield for normal mapping, evaluating BRDFs and lighting etc. Maybe even for physical simulation, collision, or animation on terrain!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/u5cS-rFvdRrpN6iFTGYqDYyF8wMLCtB5-5ir2gQVMaQo8DmURyVdqF8Fyedcx9VW5boiVP8QuQZkL8zAEqG8_TYrkqx6b0bkWajLS-8IJykhlmhtxTH_YEXw_xivXSbd_2rPVLcX" alt=""><figcaption><strong>Left: </strong>an example heightmap image, <strong>right:</strong> partial derivatives (exaggerated for demonstration) that can be used for generating normal maps for lighting, collision, and many other uses in a 3D environment.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Find edges, discontinuities, corners, and image features</strong> – the other application that I will focus much more on is simply finding image features like edges, corners, regions of “detail” or texture; areas where signal changes and becomes more “interesting”. The human visual system is actually built from many <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1350218/">edge detectors and local differentiators</a> and can be thought of as a <strong>multi-scale spatiotemporal gradient analyzer</strong>! This is biologically motivated – when signal changes in space or time, it means it’s a potential point of interest or a threat.</p>



<p>The bonus use-case of just computing the gradients is finding the orientation and description of those features. This is bread and butter of any image processing, but also very common in computer graphics – from morphological anti-aliasing, selectively super-sampling only edges, or special effects. I will go back to it in the description of local features in the <strong>Structure Tensor</strong> section, but for now let’s use the most common application – just using the gradient vector magnitude, used for example in the <strong>Sobel operator</strong>: <img width="131" height="55" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XNZ1Arqp0sBJFnwkaJY9qxwOnn75NM57llXbo-aLmwwwPLxv93Sr8qWfaOswcKcWnvc1Hy-HGWKrsW9KHj10G-UkqOICr3SYO_Q6cXWvYBIZu5EALhRiSfp-mqrHpg6rjRFXJpAP">.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B3C3hX34jil9a3GVJJY8e051jxZV-K2v2k0UqMIi9MkajBeYnB8LhKFLMlhRph-8Oe8-R5WyPzWyA9W6X6FISmSwvJ4hPf_adGwpA1Niwpn4qCNkLKYVUTk3ZK5rdLb1guiQu5rN" alt=""><figcaption>Gradient magnitude can be used for simple edge detection in an image, but also many more (described later in the post!).</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Test signals</h3>



<p>I will be testing gradients on three test images:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Siemens star</strong> – a test pattern useful to test different “angles” and different frequencies,</li><li>A simple <strong>box</strong> – has corners that can immediately show problems,</li><li>1 0 1 0 <strong>stripe</strong> pattern – frequencies exactly at Nyquist.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/y4CZ84at7ie-Rg3S_l1OQLy0qhoBmxHJXkZukiypUwb55r4dQWIPwGwG1qsdNyKCYqlhkG1TBsaYxOFTXhOFNsCIh47xyYCF5tvX6EhCAXAqORWSOOcWuxs0dF2nSyjyk_4NQan_" alt=""><figcaption>Test patterns / images</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Siemens star was rendered at 16x resolution and downsampled with a <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/04/14/bilinear-texture-filtering-artifacts-alternatives-and-frequency-domain-analysis/">sharp antialiasing filter </a>(windowed sinc). There is some aliasing in the center, but it’s ok for our use-case (we want to see a sharp signal change there and then detect it).</p>



<h2>Forward differences</h2>



<p>The first, most intuitive approach is computing <strong>forward difference</strong>.</p>



<p>This is an approximation of <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hPi-mgITwovkqTtAMg1LBk4GVXtKJqG15oSJn0MgJqljSZYk1CiM-mHoGYsW36452xxG3f2X9-72nQ2XVrTknF9v0IanFpTiRHsoGzPk-L_uVBComQrtujBayBlq_uDvpnF5HNVF" width="22" height="39"> by computing f(x+1) – f(x).</p>



<p>What I love about this solution is that it is both intuitive, naive, as well as theoretically motivated! I don’t want to rephrase the wikipedia and most of readers of my blog don’t care so much for formal proofs, so feel free to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference">have a look there</a>, or in specialized courses (<strong>side note</strong>: 2010s+ are amazing, with so many best professors sharing their course slides openly on the internet…). It’s basically built around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor expansion</a> of the f(x+1) – f(x).</p>



<p>This difference operator is the same as <strong>convolving the image with a [-1, 1] filter</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s easy, works reasonably well, is useful. But there are two bigger problems.</p>



<h3>Problem 1 – even-shift</h3>



<p>If you have <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2021/02/15/bilinear-down-upsampling-pixel-grids-and-that-half-pixel-offset/">read my previous blog post</a> – on bilinear down/upsampling – one of challenges might be visible right away. Convolving with an <strong>even-sized filter</strong>, <strong>shifts the whole image </strong>by a half a pixel.</p>



<p>It’s easily visible as well:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Mep5NBimKpkG1wHi1JFZ64tEeZH-Bavx8qZ9abnfIG8f_-vAvZERVKQs84hUSbPSiYkjVmBzyjWbTgL2oSWWyQTwuO1z2xv98LOjHp4pHsD4C09msAmnU9Z5U5Q4VO1rdAIgI24Q" alt=""><figcaption>Images vs image gradient magnitude. Notice the shift to left/top.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Depending on the application, this can be a problem or not. “A solution” is simple – undo it with another even sized filter. Perfect solution would be resampling, but resampling by a half pixel is surprisingly challenging (see my <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/04/14/bilinear-texture-filtering-artifacts-alternatives-and-frequency-domain-analysis/">another blog post</a>), so instead we can blur it with a symmetric filter. Blurring the gradient magnitude fixes it (at the cost of blur):</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ki309swxJtWYakp2nypvE4UjcgYC0uHBduyuyWzr_pamfzXFHjSlctrfAx1XPJYjk8LIECMlbRkvumjbT1TJkM225HiIggoy3lnu508mDUyDlHfRB2tog1VY82GLMcP61LK6GOO9" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Blurring with an even sized filter fixes the even sized shift. But one other problem might have became much more visible right now.</p>



<p>Note: You might wonder, what would happen if we would <strong>blur just the partial differences</strong> instead? We will see in a second.</p>



<p>But let’s focus on another, more serious problem.</p>



<h3>Problem 2 – different gradient positions for partial differences</h3>



<p><strong>Second problem</strong> is more severe; what happens if we compute <strong>multiple partial derivatives</strong>; like df/dx and df/dy this way?</p>



<p><strong>Partial derivatives are approximated at different positions!</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/l11K2D7VeRoitc_dAIwMoC5WB4RPBdcKcdDtq4ysm9z-0LzJICmias8fhGIZQWvdEzJElkTp2xCMRxn1z5EbbYH5xb7Le2AlPFhr4ynlultytNqtm98b1n9d6f_Etu3mMTxpjUiF" alt=""><figcaption>Notice how gradient being defined between pixels means that two partial forward derivatives are defined at different points! This is a big problem.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s have a look at the same plot again, this time focusing on “symmetry”. This shows why it’s a real, not just theoretical issue. If we look at gradients of a Siemens star and the box, we can see some <strong>asymmetry</strong>:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DxZNozMlWMM6xr2c3NejQXpHB9xbiwfs1GyRBeUBQIMoksEisVz5n3jGZs5zWrPZU6xeUvnBaalc3IPTIV8LDoYevY-ZirN-Gsc-XOLwBiGSRzUCuvqIqio3AcmvU5_b1eKzj2aS" alt="" width="507" height="502"><figcaption>Notice left-top gradients being stronger for Siemens star, and producing a “hole” on the box corner. Oops.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is definitely not good and will cause problems in image processing or computing normals, but it’s even worse if we look at the gradient magnitude of a simple “square” in the center of the image – notice what happens to the image corners, <strong>one corner is cut off, and another one 2x too intense</strong>!</p>



<p>This is a big problem for any real application. We need to look at better approximations.</p>



<h2>Central differences</h2>



<p>I mentioned that “blurring” partial derivatives can “recenter” them, right? What if I told you that it is also <strong>numerically more accurate</strong>? This is the so-called <strong>central difference</strong>.</p>



<p>It is evaluated by <img data-attachment-id="4275" data-permalink="https://bartwronski.com/2021/02/28/computing-gradients-on-grids-forward-central-and-diagonal-differences/gif/" data-orig-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif" data-orig-size="155,39" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gif" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif?w=155" data-large-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif?w=155" src="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif" alt="">. The division by two is important and intuitively can be understood as dividing by the distance between the pixels, or the differential dx, where dx is 2x larger.</p>



<p>When forward difference was an approximation accurate to the O(h), this one is more accurate, to O(h^2). I won’t explain those terms here, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Relation_with_derivatives">the wikipedia has some basic intro</a>, and in numerical methods literature you can find a more detailed explanation.</p>



<p>It is also <strong>equivalent to “blurring” the forward difference with a [0.5, 0.5] filter</strong>! [0.5, 0.5] o [-1, 1] leads to [-0.5, 0, 0.5]. I was initially very surprised by this connection – of a more accurate, theoretically motivated Taylor expansion, and just “some random ad-hoc practical blur”. This is even sized blur, so this also fixes the half pixel shift problem and centers both partial derivatives correctly:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QawQ4QcbqusIHhs7S0h2kekS4VQDqHCS_WizBd7dgstoHaLu5Lwj9bx_SbJImHNZnlc_aSs7FCzdYF0RW7oYjTTF3qzfoKiNENFh4yzTiYYt_GSO6lkFe-7lP2GpDs0G9XNYS52O" alt="" width="424" height="420"><figcaption>Central difference leads to perfectly symmetric (though not isotropic) results!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Problem – missing center…</p>

	<p>From <a href="https://omarshehata.me/notebook">Omar's notebook</a>.</p>
	<hr>
	
	
	<p>
		If you pull up a tuner app on your phone and play an A note on a piano, the tuner will say ~440 hz. Do the same thing on a violin's A note and you'll also get 440 hz.  
	</p>
	<p>
		This seemed impossible based on my understanding of sound, which was: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Our ears perceive sound by picking up on the frequency of the air vibrating around us.</li>
		<li>Two sounds are different if they have different frequencies, in the same way two colors appear different if they emit light of different wavelengths.</li>
		<li>When we say a sound is 440 hz, that means a point vibrating along that sound wave makes a complete cycle 440 times per second.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		So if two sound waves have exactly the same frequency, according to my tuner app, they cannot possibly sound different. But they do! Does that mean there's something else, something <i>more</i> than frequency that can differentiate sound? 
	</p>
	<p>
		There isn't! That's all sound is - vibrations in the air of some specific frequency. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Was the tuner lying? Yes, kind of: when we say a sound is 440 hz, that's not actually a complete description of the sound. It's kind of like telling you a shape has 4 points - you might assume it's a square. But it could be a rectangle, or some completely wacky irregular polygon. 
	</p>
	<h2>Visualizing a couple notes</h2>
	<p>
		Here's an A note from a piano and a violin that I recorded from online virtual instruments. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Click "Play" to hear them. Below each is a small slice of the audio. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Drag and drop your own sound file in these diagrams to use it throughout the article.</p>
	<p>
		They look structurally similar, but they're <i>not</i> the same sound wave. They both have a pattern that repeats ~3 times in 9 milliseconds (or ~440 times per second). So that's what makes them both 440 hz.
	</p>
	<p>
		But that pattern itself that repeats is different. This is why saying "A sound is 440 hz" isn't a complete description, so assumption (3) for me was a misunderstanding.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is what the sound would look like if the speaker vibrated exactly 440 times per second in a continuous, regular, motion.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The fact that all 3 of these sound different, even though they are all made of a pattern that repeats at 440 hz, tells me I need to tweak assumption (1). Our ears don't pick up on just a single frequency in the air. If they did, these sounds would be indistinguishable (which I think actually happens for our eyes, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)">metamerism</a>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		So our ears can detect the internal structure of these patterns. To decompose this structure on a computer, we'll use the Fourier transform.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Performing the Fourier Transform
	</h3>
	<p>
		The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm allows you to extract frequencies in a signal.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our signal in this case is a list of amplitudes, how loud the sound is at every sample.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you run the signal through like <code>FFT(signal)</code> you get a list numbers that correspond to a list of frequencies. For example, if the FFT output looks like this:
	</p>
	<p><code>
		[0.001, 0.1, 0.7, 0, 12, 0, 2, 1]
	</code></p><p>
		You'll also have a corresponding list of frequencies:
	</p>
	<p><code>
		[0, 55, 110, 220, 440, 880, 1320, 1760]
	</code></p><p>
		We interpret this to mean 440 is the most significant frequency in this signal, because its FFT coefficient is 12 (the largest), and it's the 5th number. And the 5th frequency in our list is 440. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I've found it easiest to interpret the results of FFT by putting it in a table in terms of the original sound frequency and the relative weights (so I divide all of them by the largest number).
	</p>
	<p>
		Below are the FFT results running on our two 9 ms slices. <a id="compute-fft" href="#">Click to expand</a> the chosen slices. You can also scroll back up to change the slices by hand.
	</p>
	<div id="fft-table-container">
		<div id="fft-table-A-container">
			<h4>Piano A note</h4>
			<p>(<span id="piano-fft-slice-number">10</span> ms slice)</p>
			<table id="fft-table-A">
			  <thead>
			    <tr>
			      <th>Freq. (hz)</th>
			      <th>Weight (%)</th>
			    </tr>
			  </thead>
			  <tbody>
				<tr>
					<td> N/A </td>

			<h4>Violin A note</h4>

					<td> N/A </td>
					<td> N/A </td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>Frequencies below 1% weight are omitted from this table.</p>
	<p>
		These tables tell us that both sounds do have ~440 hz as the strongest frequency, but there's other frequencies inside too! The violin one appears a lot more complex, in that it seems to contain a lot more frequencies that contribute significantly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The last step is reconstructing the sound from this table. Representing sound this way is really powerful. This is the basis for a lot of sound analysis/transformations like:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Compression?</b> Remove the highest frequencies that our ears can't hear as easily. </li>
		<li><b>Noise filtering?</b> Remove specific known frequencies, that's how you can remove the sound of car horns but keep your voice in a recording.</li>
		<li><b>Auto tune?</b> Check which musical note is closest to the list of frequencies in the sound, and alter/remove/add frequencies to make it sound closer to the note.</li>
		<li><b>Voice recognition?</b> You can think of the frequencies you can create by talking as a unique pattern a software can search for. Like how the letter "E" appears ~11% of the time in most English text. We all have a few frequencies in our voices that appear with predictable probability.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Below is a sandbox for you to explore these ideas of sound reconstruction.
	</p> 
	<p>
		The code returns a <code>outputMultipliers</code> array that scales the original frequencies. A new sound is reconstructed from those new frequencies/weights. You can try <a href="#" id="zero-out">zero-ing out all the high frequencies</a>, or isolate <a href="#" id="single-frequency">a single frequency</a>.

	<h3>
		Takeaways
	</h3>
	<p>
		So the correct version of assumption (3) is: When we say a sound is 440 hz, we mean that's the frequency with the most weight in the signal. To give a complete description of the sound you need to know (1) all the frequencies it's made of and (2) how much of each frequency to use.  
	</p>
	<p>
		I created this to learn how FFT works. This is the end-to-end demonstration I was looking for to help me understand it. It's best used to test your understanding while reading other materials. I don't have the source code up yet but if you'd like to extend this or use it as a teaching tool just let me know! 
	</p>
	<p>
	 	You can drag and drop any sound file in the very first two figures and all figures will update to use it, including the FFT tables and the code sandbox. Here's a few notes from <a href="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/sound-samples/">Philharmonia</a> you can try dragging in:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://omarshehata.me/static/whoisomar/images/notebook/sound/banjo_a4.mp3" download="">Banjo A note</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://omarshehata.me/static/whoisomar/images/notebook/sound/flute_a4.mp3" download="">Flute A note</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://omarshehata.me/static/whoisomar/images/notebook/sound/saxophone_a4.mp3" download="">Saxophone A note</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		A few key points I needed for a correct implementation:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>How to retrieve the original frequencies from the FFT output.</b> The FFT only tells you the frequency in terms of how often it repeats in the list of samples. So you need to multiple by the sample rate (like 44100 for most sound) to get frequency per second (Hz). Most FFT libraries in JS do NOT give you a list of the frequencies (just the coefficients). The formula for figuring out what frequency corresponds to what coefficient <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4364823/how-do-i-obtain-the-frequencies-of-each-value-in-an-fft/4371627#4371627" target="_blank">is described here</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>You have to take a small slice of the audio.</b> Given that the frequency of the sound changes over time, even when playing a single note, you won't get accurate/expected frequencies if you FFT the entire thing. For example, a piano note has an "attack" and a "decay", you want to take a slice from the middle. 
			<ul>
				<li>See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform">Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT)</a>. This is computing FFT for a small slice of audio as we just did, but do this for all slices of the audio. You'll get a list of frequencies over time. This is often visualized as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>You have to sample an integer number of cycles.</b> If you take an arbitrary slice of a pure A note, you likely will get a lot more than 440 in your FFT table, unless you happen to pick a start and an end that matches a multiple of the cycle length. This article automatically shortens any slice to the nearest cycle (we figure that out by finding the nearest sample where the signal crosses the Y axis). This is also important when playing the reconstructed sound on loop (otherwise you hear a popping sound).
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>The discrete fourier transform (DFT) doesn't include all possible frequencies.</b> In theory, FFT is a continuous sum (AKA an integral) of all possible frequencies in the audio. What we have implemented here is a discrete version, where we sum a finite list of frequencies. In a small slice you may not get 440 exactly as an output, only because it wasn't included as a frequency the algorithm was looking for. I <i>think</i> in principle you could have an implementation that allows you to specify what frequencies must be included (if you know what you're looking for) but I haven't seen such an implementation.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>FFT isn't magic.</b> A popular analogy is that FFT can take a smoothie and extract all the component that went into it. But this seems impossible??? The trick is the FFT comes in with an assumption of what frequencies might be in there. We go through each possible frequency and ask "How much 440 hz is in this sound?" and "How much 880 hz is in this sound?" and so on. So it's closer to having an unknown substance and figuring out what it is by checking if it reacts to known chemicals/substances.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A few insights I learned from exploring the code sandbox:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>The sum of all the frequencies &lt; 1% weight have a big effect.</b> I had these hidden in the FFT tables thinking they weren't significant, and any one of them isn't, but removing them altogether does have a very noticeable effect. Here's a <a href="#" id="remove-low-weight">code snippet</a> (scroll up) that removes all frequencies with weight less than 1%. Or try the opposite, listen to only weights less than 1%.</li>
		<li><b>The high frequencies are a big part of the violin sound.</b> Removing anything at 5000 hz and up makes it no longer really sound like a violin (or just sound really muted). This isn't true for the piano.</li>
		<li><b>A string tuned to 440 hz will never emit frequencies any lower than that</b>. This is true because of the physics of standing waves, but it was really cool to learn about this in theory, and then go back to this interface and see that this was indeed true for all the recordings of notes I had! Without having known this before I …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Managing data is hard. Managing data pipelines is even harder. The meaning of individual tables or values in your data warehouse gets lost in translation across organizations. Another team’s refactor breaks your team’s pipeline. And, it’s normally very difficult to tell who made what change and when.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a>, data build tool, alleviates these frustrations by taking over the transformation step in your ETL pipelines. <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/what--exactly--is-dbt-/">dbt is not itself a data processor</a>, but instead sits on top of your data warehouse that contains your already extracted and loaded data. dbt allows teams to easily test, document, and version-control their data transformations.</p>
<p>While dbt is a great tool for transforming batch data, it cannot currently transform streaming data in real time. (The dbt team explicitly warns users about this in a <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/is-dbt-the-right-tool-for-my-data-transformations/">few</a> <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-to-create-near-real-time-models-with-just-dbt-sql/1457">places</a>.) Here at <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, we want to help the world stop batching and start streaming. So we* built a dbt adapter that will allow you to transform your streaming data in real time using Materialize as your data warehouse.</p>
<p>The rest of this post will explore why dbt works best with batch data and how using Materialize unlocks streaming transformations. If you’re eager to get started, the <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/misc/dbt-materialize">dbt-materialize adapter is here</a>, and our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/play/wikirecent-dbt">sample streaming project is here</a>. Note: The dbt-materialize adapter is an <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5462">active work in progress</a> and not yet suitable for production use-cases. Please file issues or submit PRs as you see fit, we love feedback!</p>
<p>*The dbt-materialize adapter was originally created by Josh Wills and actively shaped by Jeremy Cohen. Thank you for all of your work and support!</p>
<h2>dbt and batch data</h2>
<p>dbt is great at transforming batch data, but it cannot transform streaming data efficiently in real time. To understand why, let’s take a look at how dbt transforms data under the hood.</p>
<p>dbt users define their desired transformations using <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/">dbt “models”</a>. dbt models are SQL files that contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>A SELECT statement that performs the desired transformation</li>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/materializations/">“materialization”</a> parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>dbt transforms your data each time you <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/run/">“run”</a> a model. Each time a model is run, dbt queries the underlying data warehouse using that model’s SELECT statement. The result set of the query (the transformed data) is then either returned directly to the user or persisted into your data warehouse, depending on the model’s materialization parameter.</p>
<p>Currently, dbt supports four types of materializations: <em>table</em>, <em>view</em>, <em>incremental</em>, and <em>ephemeral</em>. The <em>table</em> and <em>incremental</em> materializations persist a table, the <em>view</em> materialization creates a view, and the <em>ephemeral</em> materialization, instead of persisting anything, returns results directly using a common table expression (CTE). The good news is that these database objects are totally sufficient to transform batch data. The bad news is that none of these database objects transform streaming data efficiently.</p>
<p>First, what do I mean by batch and streaming data? Batch data, as the name suggests, is any type of data that arrives in discrete batches. This can be once a minute, once an hour, or once a day. The important thing is that no new data arrives between batches. Streaming data, on the other hand, arrives continually and at no particular schedule.</p>
<p>So, why are these database objects sufficient to transform batch data, but not able to efficiently transform streaming data?</p>
<p>Views and CTEs do not physically persist data to your data warehouse. This means that each time you query a model that uses a view or CTE, your data warehouse must re-transform the underlying source data. And, each time you transform your source data, you are paying some cost. While views and CTEs always return up-to-date transformations of your batch and streaming data, they do not do so efficiently.</p>
<p>Tables, on the other hand, do physically persist data. More specifically, tables persist the result set of the last time their model “dbt run.” Unlike views and CTEs, this means that you won’t pay the price of transforming data each time your table is queried. But, this means that your transformed data can quickly become stale as new data arrives. This is not an issue with batch data because you can simply “dbt run” your table each time a new batch arrives. Unfortunately, things aren’t so simple with streaming data.</p>
<p>Because streaming data does not arrive on a schedule, there is no longer a right time to re-run your models to keep them up-to-date. Instead, you’re forced to choose between maximizing data freshness and minimizing transformation costs. You can minimize your costs by limiting how often you recreate your tables, effectively turning your streaming data into batch data. Or, you can maximize your data freshness by continually recreating your tables. But, this approach will cost you time and money, leave you vulnerable to bugs, and still won’t maintain truly up-to-date results.</p>
<p>So, what should you do if you want to transform streaming data with dbt?</p>
<h2>dbt and streaming data</h2>
<p>dbt currently has one official and one unofficial way to approximate transforming streaming data. Neither of these methods truly transforms streaming data in real-time, and both come at a cost.</p>
<p>The first method to approximate transforming streaming data is to create models with an incremental materialization. The first time you run an incremental model, dbt persists your transformation’s result set into a table in your data warehouse. For subsequent runs, dbt only transforms the subset of source data indicated by your model’s filter predicate. (For example, you might have a filter predicate that will only transform data with a timestamp greater than your last model’s run.)</p>
<p>While incremental models reduce the severity of the tradeoff that users face when persisting their transformations in tables (data freshness vs cost), they do not eliminate the tradeoff entirely. By design, you will probably be paying a lesser cost each time you “dbt run” an incremental model. (I say “probably” here because even though you’re only transforming a few rows of data with each run, unless you’re filtering cleverly, your model’s SELECT statement will still have to scan the entire underlying source table or view to discover these rows). While these lesser costs may free you up to run your incremental models more frequently, you still will not be able to run them continuously. By definition, you are still transforming your streaming data with a batch process.</p>
<p>The second way to approximate transforming streaming data is the <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-to-create-near-real-time-models-with-just-dbt-sql/1457">unofficial “lambda view” approach</a>. This method simulates transformations over “near real-time models” by querying a combined historical table and a current view. This approach incurs the cost of querying both of the underlying database objects using some filter, similar to the incremental materialization. The current view of your data returns up-to-date results, but must re-transform the recent data each time.</p>
<p>Neither of these methods can efficiently transform data in real time. (And, they come with <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/on-the-limits-of-incrementality/303">hairy problems</a> if, say, you have streaming data that might arrive late.) In order to efficiently perform worry-free, real-time transformations of streaming data, dbt would need to persist a database object that updates as new data arrives upstream. Luckily, there is a database object that can do this for us: materialized views.</p>
<h2>dbt and Materialize</h2>
<p>Materialized views in traditional databases behave a bit like dbt’s incremental materialization. When a materialized view is first created, the result set of its query is physically persisted in the database. Then, at some interval or when manually triggered, the stored result set is updated with recent data. Like the incremental materialization, maintaining these materialized views incurs a variety of costs.</p>
<p>This is the exact problem Materialize was created to solve. Unlike traditional materialized views, <a href="https://materialize.com/why-use-a-materialized-view/">our materialized views</a> continually update as new data arrives–no refreshes needed. Better yet, we provide up-to-date results with millisecond latency. (For more information about Materialize and our materialized views, check out <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/">our documentation</a>.)</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for dbt and streaming data? This means that the first time you run a dbt model on top of Materialize, dbt persists a materialized view. <strong>Then, you never have to run your model again.</strong> No matter how much or how frequently your data arrives, your model will stay up to date. No matter when you query your view, it will return a fresh answer. Just by creating your model with our materialized views, you can confidently and efficiently transform streaming data in real time.</p>

<p>
I've been wanting org to keep track of my daily habits for a little while. The catalist: reading James Clear's wonderful <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> (along with plenty of lock-down inspiration).
</p>

<p>
As much as I live in Emacs and org mode, it just wasn't practical enough to rely on my laptop for tracking habits. I wanted less friction, so I've been experimenting with building a toy app for my needs. Naturally, org support was a strict requirement, so I could always poke at it from my beloved editor.
</p>

<p>
I've been using the app every day with success. The habits seem to be sticking, but equally important, it's been really fun to join the fabulous world of Emacs/Org with iOS/SwiftUI.
</p>

<p>
This is all very experimental<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> and as mentioned on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ljurwx/org_habits_ios_app_want_to_try_it/">reddit</a> (follow-up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lp62vn/org_habits_ios_app_followup_twoway_edit/">here</a>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1361034010047176705">twitter</a>, the app isn't available on the App Store. I may consider publishing if there's enough interest, but in the mean time, you can reach out and install via <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/">TestFlight</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>So here you are, you’ve built a tool for the Chrome Web Store and suddenly you’ve been bestowed with a<strong> couple of thousand users across the globe</strong>.</p><p>One question, would be how to monetise such an impressive piece of tech you’ve created.</p><p>If you’ve spent your time on an Android or iOS, the path to monetisation are far easy &amp; a lot simplier. Somehow, however, <strong>Chrome Extensions don’t carry the same weight</strong> in the mind of the user. They are much more inclined to pay for an app or an ongoing service but Chrome Extensions wind up in the realm of “should be free.”</p><p>A lot of chrome extensions are the child of a large product or a global product itself, cases such as Honey, the coupon finder &amp; Grammerly are super giants that don’t really fall into the realm of developer accidently making a tool valuable to thousands.</p><p>There seems to be a vat of extensions floating around the 20k to 50k mark, not been updated since 2015. What do to?</p><p>Rather than give you a list of things<strong> untried or untested with affiliate links attached, let’s run through stories that I know.</strong></p><p>There's a new platform called <a href="https://monetise.so/">Monetise.so</a>, they have built a Chrome Extension billing platform as a direct replacement for the upcoming sunset of the Chrome Web Store Payments.</p><p>Check them out : <a href="https://monetise.so/">https://monetise.so</a></p><p>It’s no secret that Adblock Plus with their ~100 Million global users have profited from the blockage of adverts existing on internet.</p><p>The business model is unique &amp; simple, they allowed certain whitelisted ads through, non-intrusive and Google paid them an undisclosed amount.</p><p>They are not the only ones who do what they do, but they’re very good at it.<br>They aggregate affiliate schemes across the internet and put them into a single JS file for you to plugin to your site. They also built something for Chrome Extensions, after you include in your code, they will start including logos on Google Search Results, like so:</p><figure><img src="https://tillypay.com/blog/content/images/2020/02/1-tf0Kx1jGsc5mmRHPo7VYXA.png"></figure><p>The DJI link is now monetised and everyone is happy, the user who is paying somewhat for the extension, the extension developer but not Google Chrome, understandably.</p><p>This is malvertising, it’s advertising in a malware way of including unwanted code. Even with it’s horrid name, if privacy is not your thing, then there’s very little impacting the end user. The issue comes when you are allowing a third party with that much access to your google searches, maybe not.</p><p>Actually, I do have access to the maths on this:</p><ul><li><strong>50,000 Weekly Users resulted in about €2.2k a month.</strong></li><li>That’s about <strong>4.4 cent per user,</strong> mostly from Tier 1 GEOs (US, UK, FR, DE)</li></ul><p>Google will kick you out if they find this.<br>It's happened time &amp; time again.</p><p>Revolution, is what they called it.<br>A new way to monetise the internet.</p><p>Yes, but no. Firstly, the UX for your end-user sucks balls.<br>Their brand new computer is down to it’s last leg trying to get the you (the developer), $0.0002 per minute of agony.</p><p>Also, I’ve tried this.<br>I had 10k Weekly Users, that turned into about 30 concurrent users on average at any one time.</p><p>I made $16 a month from Coinhive at 25% of his user’s CPU.</p><p>Back to the drawing board.</p><p><em>Freemium</em><br>Popular topic on the lips of SaaS models, provide something a bit more &amp; users are willing to pay for it. The problem you may have is that you product just isn’t worth a cup of coffee a month. On a popular VPN Chrome extension, they managed to get 50k users a month to pay for their premium product out of a user base of 4 million MAU. Their premium product was pretty damn great too.</p><p>Here are some great stories of Chrome Extensions being monetised in this way:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/how-sharing-helpful-knowledge-helped-me-grow-to-2-500-month-ad9b94660e">Weather App</a> - $2.5k MRR</li><li><a href="https://beebs.io/">Beebs</a> - <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/from-no-coding-skills-to-50k-downloads-in-two-years-eca7ea8587">$5K MRR</a></li><li>Nighteye, nightmode - <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/night-eye">$2.3k MRR</a></li></ul><p><em>Paid-Only</em><br>Yes, this works well if your product is good enough for the switch.<br>Might be fairly difficult to encourage users to pay for the simple RSS extension you created.</p><p><em>Paywall or not to Paywall</em><br>Paywalling your current userbase guarantees the maximum number of conversions in that time period, everything else is bad news. Chrome extensions have review mechanisms that mean you’ll paywall your userbase &amp; they turn to the review board for revenge. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/media-hint/akipcefbjlmpbcejgdaopmmidpnjlhnb" rel="noopener nofollow">See here</a>.</p><p>I decided to paywall all the new users but keep the old users free. This way I had 50,000 people who loved &amp; would recommend the extension and a steady stream of newcomers who some (5%) of them would pay a monthly subscription for it.</p><p><strong>The best way to start paywalling is to use <a href="https://monetise.so/">Monetise.so</a>, they are a direct replacement of the Chrome Web Store.</strong></p><p>This could be a possibility for you, I know of a few examples this works well:</p><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-for-a-cause/gibkoahgjfhphbmeiphbcnhehbfdlcgo?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow">Tab for a Cause</a><br>They have a new tab page with an advert on it, they donate roughly ~30% of their Gross Revenue to charities.</p><p>Total Q1 2019 Revenue: <strong>$139,395.93.</strong><br>$0.25 per user per month, not bad at all.</p><p>They have, what you probably don’t is a lot of coverage being at the new tab page of every single user.</p><p><a href="http://ecosia.org/" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Ecosi</strong></a>a is the tree planting search engine, uses its advert revenue into planting trees across the planet. It’s difficult to quantify as they have many platforms.<br>However, diverting your user-base to a search engine is quite a profitable business, the difficulty is getting them there in the first place.</p><p>Unsure on the user numbers, but they made €2.5M in the last reported month with 10 million users. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/norton-safe-search/gkjahlcnbjiangkneanonnndppicobbd?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Norton Safe Search</strong></a> is an example of a company forcefully changing your search engine for monetary gain, there is absolutely zero benefit to an anti-virus search engine, none.</p><p>You have to be a position where changing search or implementing adverts seems legitimate. Google will quickly remove your extension if you do that.</p><p>Thee value of switching user for these Bing-copycat search engines is about €0.80 per weekly user for a tier 1 geo; really not bad going.</p><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panda-5-your-favorite-web/haafibkemckmbknhfkiiniobjpgkebko?hl=de&amp;" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Panda</strong></a> offer chrome extension, 60K weekly users that probably wittles down to 10k MAU. Squarespace reportedly pay $4k a month for a spot.</p><p>Don’t do this.<br>Like <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/12/17/chrome-avast-extensions-removed/" rel="noopener nofollow">Avast have done</a>, they collected clickstream data to feed their other suspicously data rich company, <a href="https://www.jumpshot.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">Jumpshot</a>.<br>Like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/evidon-sells-ghostery-data-to-advertisers-2013-6?r=DE&amp;IR=T" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghostery</a> have done.</p><p>Both Firefox &amp; Chrome will kick you out even at a whiff of this.<br>Good money, undoubtedly but I have no numbers.<br>I was recently told of a 6 digit figure for access to search data with Jumpshot.</p><p>Hola Unblocker allow for users to access geo-blocked content, but at a cost.<br>Your computer becomes a part of the appropriately named, <a href="https://luminati.io/" rel="noopener nofollow">Luminati</a> network.<br>They then sell your connection to the highest bidder and all sorts can run through the computer. It makes unblocking a doddle. With access to apparently 40M residential IPs, it’s pretty massive and <a href="https://luminati.io/static/IPPN-analysis-2019.pdf?md5=3109015-85e418b7" rel="noopener nofollow">making $40M a year.</a></p><p>If you don't understand residential proxies, here's a<a href="https://proxyscraper.io/what-is-a-residential-proxy/"> little guide.</a></p><p>Lastly, donations. I only really have non-quantitative information on donations for Chrome Extensions.</p><p>They don’t work as well as they should, you might gather bits &amp; pieces of cash here and there but it’s the lowest form of per user donation, you are not wikipedia or the Guardian, remember that.</p><p>If you’ve gathered enough mass and provide a valuable time/money/effort savings product, then I’d opt for the Premium tier.<br>If you can place adverts or have an opportunity to, try that out.<br>Ultimately, get to know your users and get a feel for what fits well.</p><p>Anything untoward is unsustainable.<br>Good luck.</p>

  <p>Summary: I believe that small websites are compelling aesthetically, but are also important to help us resist selling our souls to large tech companies. In this essay I present a vision for the “small web” as well as the small software and architectures that power it. Also, a bonus rant about microservices.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>About fifteen years ago, I read E. F. Schumacher’s <em>Small is Beautiful</em> and, despite not being interested in economics, I was moved by its message. Perhaps even more, I loved the terse poetry of the book’s title – it resonated with my frugal upbringing and my own aesthetic.</p>

<p>I think it’s time for a version of that book about technology, with a chapter on web development: <em>The Small Web is Beautiful: A Study of Web Development as if People Mattered.</em> Until someone writes that, this essay will have to do.</p>

<p>There are two aspects of this: first, <strong>small teams and companies</strong>. I’m not going to talk much about that here, but <a href="https://basecamp.com/books">Basecamp</a> and many others have. What I’m going to focus on in this essay is <strong>small websites and architectures</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m not the first to talk about the “small web”, but, somewhat surprisingly, only a few people have discussed it using that term. Here are the main web pages I can find that do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">Rediscovering the Small Web</a> by Parimal Satyal: a fabulous article about the joy of small, independent (and sometimes retro) websites in contrast to the “commercial web”.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">What is the Small Web?</a>, by Aral Balkan of the Small Technology Foundation: more of a manifesto against the surveillance of Big Tech than something concrete, but still interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why aim small in this era of fast computers with plenty of RAM? A number of reasons, but the ones that are most important to me are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fewer moving parts. It’s easier to create more robust systems and to fix things when they do go wrong.</li>
  <li>Small software is faster. Fewer bits to download and clog your computer’s memory.</li>
  <li>Reduced power consumption. This is important on a “save the planet” scale, but also on the very local scale of increasing the battery life of your phone and laptop.</li>
  <li>The light, frugal aesthetic. That’s personal, I know, but as you’ll see, I’m not alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s dive in. I want to cover a bunch of different angles, each with its own subheading.</p>

<h2 id="small-software">Small software</h2>

<p>If we’re going to talk about a small web, we need to start with small <em>software</em>.</p>

<p>As a teen, I learned to program using x86 assembly and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> – perhaps odd choices, but my dad was heavily into Forth, and I loved how the language was so simple I could write <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/third">my own bootstrapped compiler</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of career, I started as an embedded programmer – not as in “embedded Linux” but as in microcontrollers where 16KB of RAM was generous. My current laptop has 16GB of RAM, and that’s not a lot by today’s standards. We were building IP-networked products with <em>one millionth</em> the amount of RAM. Those kinds of micros are as cheap as chips (ahem), and still widely used for small electronic devices, sensors, internet-of-things products, and so on.</p>

<p>You have to think about every byte, compile with size optimizations enabled, and reuse buffers. It’s a very different thing from modern web development, where a JavaScript app compiles “down” to a 1MB bundle, or a single Python object header is 16 bytes before you’ve even got any data, or a Go hello-world binary is 2MB even before you’ve added any real code.</p>

<p>How do you create small programs? I think the main thing is that you have to <em>care about size</em>, and most of us don’t think we have time for that. Apart from embedded development, there’s an entire programming subculture called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a> that cares about this. They have competitions for the smallest 4KB demos: who can pack the most graphical punch into 4096 bytes of executable. That’s smaller than many favicons! (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB0vBmiTr6o">Elevated</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCh3Q08HMfs">cdak</a> are two of the highest-rated 4K demos.) Many demosceners go on to become game developers.</p>

<p>It’s not just about executable size … when you’re developing your next command line tool, if you use Go or Rust or even C, your program will be much faster, smaller, and use less memory than a Python or Java equivalent. And easier to install. If you don’t understand why, please do learn. (It’s out of scope for this essay, but to summarize: Go, Rust, and C compile to ready-to-execute machine code, don’t carry around a virtual machine, and don’t have memory overhead for objects like integers.)</p>

<p>But why not apply some of the same principles to web development? In the web world, I think the main trick is to be careful what dependencies you include, and also what dependencies <em>they</em> pull in. In short, know <code>node_modules</code> – or maybe better, <em>no</em> <code>node_modules</code>. More about this <a href="#fewer-dependencies">below</a>.</p>

<p>Niklaus Wirth of Pascal fame wrote a famous paper in 1995 called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf">A Plea for Lean Software [PDF]</a>. His take is that “a primary cause for the complexity is that software vendors uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want”, and “when a system’s power is measured by the number of its features, quantity becomes more important than quality”. He goes on to describe Oberon, a computer language (which reminds me of Go in several ways) and an operating system that he believes helps solve the complexity problem. Definitely wirth a read!</p>

<p>I’ve been mulling over this for a number of years – back in 2008 I wrote a sarcastic dig at how bloated Adobe Reader had become: <a href="https://blog.brush.co.nz/2008/07/adobe-reader-9/">Thank you, Adobe Reader 9!</a> It was a 33MB download and required 220MB of hard drive space even in 2008 (it’s now a 150MB download, and I don’t know how much hard drive space it requires, because I don’t install it these days).</p>

<p>But instead of just complaining, how do we actually solve this problem? Concretely, I think we need to start doing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Care about size: this sounds obvious, but things only change when people think they’re important.</li>
  <li>Measure: both your executable’s size, and your program’s memory usage. You may want to measure over time, and make it a blocking issue if the measurements grow more than <em>x</em>% in a release. Or you could hold a memory-reduction sprint every so often.</li>
  <li>Language: choose a backend language that has a chance, for example Rust, C or C++, or for servers, Go. These languages aren’t right for everything (like data transformation scripts), but they produce small executables, and they’re good for CLIs and desktop apps.</li>
  <li>Remove: cut down your feature set. Aim for a small number of high-quality features. My car can’t fly or float, and that’s okay – it drives well.</li>
  <li>Say no to new features: unless they really fit your philosophy, or add more than they cost over the lifetime of your project.</li>
  <li>Dependencies: understand the size and complexity of each dependency you pull in. Use only built-in libraries if you can.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="small-websites">Small websites</h2>

<p>I’m glad there’s a growing number of people interested in small websites.</p>

<p>A few months ago there was a sequence of posts to Hacker News about various “clubs” you could post your small website on: the <a href="https://1mb.club/">1MB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25151773">comments</a>), <a href="https://512kb.club/">512KB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25450451">comments</a>), <a href="https://250kb.club/">250KB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25176663">comments</a>), and even the <a href="https://10kbclub.com/">10KB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25556860">comments</a>). I think those are a fun indicator of renewed interested in minimalism, but I will say that raw size isn’t enough – a 2KB site with no real content isn’t much good, and a page with 512KB of very slow JavaScript is worse than a snappy site with 4MB of well-chosen images.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite small websites are:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a>: I personally like the minimalist, almost brutalist design, but I love its lightness even more. I just downloaded the home page, and loading all resources transfers only 21KB (61KB uncompressed). Even pages with huge comment threads only transfer about 100KB of compressed data, and load quickly. Reddit has become such a bloated mess in comparison. Hacker News, never change!</p>

<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/">Lobsters</a>: a similar news-and-voting site, with slightly more “modern” styling. It uses some JavaScript and profile icons, but it’s still clean and fast, and the total transfer size for the homepage is only 102KB. You just don’t need megabytes to make a good website.</p>

<p><a href="https://sourcehut.org/">Sourcehut</a>: I like the concept behind Drew DeVault’s business, but I love how small and anti-fluff the website is. He has set up a mini-site called the <a href="https://forgeperf.org/">Software Forge Performance Index</a> that tracks size and browser performance of the prominent source code websites – Sourcehut is far and away the lightest and fastest. Even his homepage is only 81KB, including several screenshot thumbnails.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>: not only is SQLite a small, powerful SQL database engine, the website is fantastically small and content-rich. Even their 7000-word <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html">page about testing</a> is only 70KB. How do they do this? It’s not magic: focus on high-quality textual content, minimal CSS, no JavaScript, and very few images (a small logo and some SVGs).</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/">LWN</a>: I’m a little biased, because I’ve written <a href="https://lwn.net/Archives/GuestIndex/#Hoyt_Ben">articles</a> for them, but they’re an excellent website for Linux and programming news. Extremely high-quality technical content (and a high bar for authors). They’re definitely niche, and have a “we focus on quality content, not updating our CSS every year” kind of look – they’ve been putting out great content for 23 years! Their homepage only downloads 44KB (90KB uncompressed).</p>

<p><a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu’s blog</a>: this is one of the more hardcore examples. His inline CSS is only about 200 bytes (the pages are basically unstyled), and his HTML source code doesn’t use any linefeed characters. Kind of a fun point, although then he goes on to load 20KB of Google Analytics JavaScript…</p>

<p>As a friend pointed out, those websites have something of an “anti-aesthetic aesthetic”. I confess to not minding that at all, but on the other hand, small doesn’t have to mean ugly. More and more personal blogs and websites have adopted a small web approach but are more typographically appealing:</p>

    <p>You already know that Peergos lets you store and share files securely and privately. Now, you can also host your own website on it!</p>
<p>We always thought getting a website up and running should be one of the easiest things to do on the web. There are plenty of options available for website hosting, but with Peergos there's no need to buy a domain name, arrange TLS certificates, or run a server to host the content. You also don't need any cryptocurrency to post or update your website, so you can get free instantaneous updates and peer-to-peer authenticated delivery. You can sign up to <a href="https://beta.peergos.net/?signup=true">our beta</a> today and get started right away in just two easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Upload your website files to a directory in Peergos.
</li>
<li>
Go to your profile, set that directory as your website and click publish.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Your personal website will now be available at <tt>https://&lt;your-user-name&gt;.peergos.me</tt>. It doesn't get any simpler than that. Let's see this in action!</p>
<center>
<img alt="www" id="id" src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/p2p-webhosting.gif" width="90%">
<br>
Host your decentralized website directly from Peergos.
</center>
<p>Any changes made to your website files are automatically and instantly reflected in your website. When we say instantaneous, we mean it. Check it out below!</p>
<center>
<img alt="www-update" id="id" src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/p2p-web-update.gif" width="90%">
<br>
Instantaneous and free updates to your decentralized website.
</center>
<p>When you publish a website from Peergos, you can view it through any Peergos gateway. We're running one at <tt>peergos.me</tt>, so your website will be available at <tt>https://&lt;your-user-name&gt;.peergos.me</tt>, and viewable in any browser today. Bear in mind that viewing through a public gateway like that still relies on DNS and the TLS certificate authorities, which are both single points of failure that are vulnerable to attack. However, we can actually get around both of these by viewing someone's site through a local Peergos gateway. To visit someone's site in this way, you just run a local Peergos instance and browse to <tt>http://&lt;username&gt;.peergos.localhost:9000</tt>. The gateway looks up the public key of the username provided in the localhost subdomain via the Peergos PKI, then retrieves the website and serves it. All this is done without relying on DNS or TLS certificates anywhere. We are thus able to use localhost subdomains to achieve isolation and security between different sites served from one local gateway. </p>
<p>Websites hosted on Peergos benefit from our resilient and reliable decentralized architecture. Most of the heavy lifting is done by <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> through content addressing and public key based routing. With our architecture, we add fast mutable pointers and human-readable names. Therefore, you can trust that the content of your website will be readily available without having to rely on a single-point-of-failure-server anywhere. </p>
<p>In the future, we will enable viewing such websites directly inside the Peergos web interface. At that point, Peergos will really start to look like a new web.</p>
<p>There are still a few free accounts available on <a href="https://beta.peergos.net/?signup=true">our beta</a>. Let us know what you think. We're always looking for feedback, so either <a href="mailto://peergos@peergos.org">drop us a line</a> or come say hi in our <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#peergos-chat:matrix.org">Matrix chatroom</a>.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>SolidRun has a new development in their NXP Layerscape LX2160A based systems this week. The new SolidRun HoneyComb LX2 Server packages two of their familiar HoneyComb LX2K boards into a single chassis. This includes a power supply and accommodations for 2.5″ or 3.5″ SATA storage. While the board at the core of this system is not a new part this does mark a milestone for deploy-ability of Arm systems at a tier that does not have a lot of other attention.<span id="more-51095"></span></p>
<h2>SolidRun HoneyComb LX2 Server Background</h2>
<p>To take a step back and look at where this system lands, the Arm ecosystem currently has a lot of activity at the top and bottom of the price and performance spectrum, with not a lot of options in the middle. That is where SolidRun’s new dual-node server aims to compete.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi systems between $5 and $100 have shipped over 30 million units. Developer kits such as these have earned a level of ubiquity in learning and DIY spaces for making it really easy to try out new concepts in programming or “physical computing.” While the Raspberry Pi Foundation has demonstrated using the Raspberry Pi 4 in production, including running Raspberry Pi 4s to serve their website for the launch of the Pi 4, that is not quite what they are designed for. In that example, the Foundation included their own hardware between more performant load balancers and database machines as a demonstration of their very capable new devices, not quite as a shot across the bow to the Xeons they may have replaced.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, several orders of magnitude away, Ampere Altra is making a case for permanently replacing some of those Xeons for certain customers. Ampere’s price-to-performance numbers are impressive, as are figures like 160 cores for a 2 socket server and 128 lanes of PCIe Gen4 per socket. This underscores that this is a platform designed for cloud providers and hyperscalers.

<p>There is enough intrigue over the top-of-line Arm servers that developers wonder if there is not a better workstation-level/ or entry/mid-range server system. A prospective Arm developer would want something between $100 for a dev board and $4000 per socket for a screaming 2U. (Apologies to the $800 32-core 1.7GHz SKU at the other end of the Ampere Altra line.)</p>
<p>SolidRun has been positioning itself in this space for several years. Its LX2 products continue in active development. HoneyComb’s maturity dovetails with the work SolidRun has been doing on two fronts. It is servicing its niche and driving specific development (for example their high bandwidth networking) but return their development work to benefit the ease of adoption from mainline Linux.</p>

<p>The HoneyComb LX2K is a COM Express Type 7 carrier for an NXP Layerscape LX2160A System-on-Chip with 16x Arm A72 cores running up to 2GHz. The COM Express Type 7 module has dual-channel DDR4 in SODIMMs for up to 64GB total. The carrier board exposes 4x SATA, one M.2 and one Micro SD slot for storage, four SFP+ (directly from the SoC) and one RJ45 at 1Gb for networking, dual USB 3.0 ports, and an open-ended PCIe x8 slot on a standard mini ITX form factor using standard ATX power. There is even the ATX standard power indicator and reset button header. The goal seems to be to create a platform that is easy to integrate into existing chassis and systems.</p>

<p>In the context of running highly deployable servers to replace Xeons, this may not be quite the same level of hardware maturity. On the other hand, having a dual-node 1U platform that one can deploy in racks and do Arm development is a big step forward. Not only do we get a bigger CPU, but we also get the ability to use a lot of standard components which will help boost the ecosystem as well. Adding a chassis with cooling and power may not seem like a big deal, but there is a large segment of the market that does not want to search for or cobble together these solutions. Instead, if the nodes are already in a 1U chassis, that lowers the friction and barriers to entry for development. This is still not a $400-500 PC or Atom server. Still, it is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>SolidRun’s HoneyComb LX2K is a platform that is accessible and capable for development on 64-bit Arm architecture as a workstation. It is also becoming more deployment-ready for appliance-type power-conscious edge applications with the 1U chassis. Developers interested in using the HoneyComb board in production have faced the challenge of trying to rack-mount an ITX board. Bamboo Systems in the UK have an answer for developers ready to deploy an 8-node 1U, but that raises the bar back up the scale of Ampere Altra. The challenge with small server nodes is that as one scales, it tends to be more efficient having larger nodes. AWS Gravition2 is an important product for the industry, but it is also tied to the AWS ecosystem. The new availability to deploy two nodes in 1U targets the intersection of accessibility and capability for those interested to kick the tires on Arm in the wild.</p>
<p>We look forward to getting our hands on the dual sled system and doing an in-depth review. We will also pair that with approaching the HoneyComb Board as a workstation for daily-driver use. Leave a comment if you would like to see specific applications explored for either system.</p>

describing context-sensitive grammars. This post looks at implementing a more
restricted parsing library, structured around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor">applicative
functors</a> rather
than monads.</p>

<p>What could justify giving up on monads? Depending on the design, one may get
a few things in return. In this exercise, the aim is for an API with the following
features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The ability to extract all valid symbols from a parser.</li>
  <li>Allow some form of pretty printing.</li>
  <li>Support multiple evaluation strategies (e.g. backtracking and non-backtracking).</li>
</ol>

<p>To see why (1) is not possible to accomplish with monads, consider a parser
constructed using the monadic <em>bind-operator</em>:</p>



<p>Here, <code>f</code> is a function of the form <code>'a -&gt; 'b parser</code>; that means we don’t
know what sort of parser it produces until it’s provided with a value. Therefore,
we cannot infer all possible symbols consumed by those parsers. The same
reasoning applies to pretty printing.</p>

<h3 id="designing-a-parser-type">Designing a parser type</h3>

<p>The essence of a parser is a function with a type analogous to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>list</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>char</span> <span>list</span><span>)</span> <span>option</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A parser takes a list of characters as input, and, when successful, returns a
parsed value along with the remaining input.</p>

<p>This representation, however, falls short of supporting symbol
extraction, pretty printing, or allowing for multiple evaluation strategies.
To accommodate for those we’d have to embellish the type with more context.
The problem is we don’t necessarily know the complete feature set upfront.
Every time a request for some new capability comes in – be it error reporting,
logging or something else – we would have to go back and change the definition
to accommodate for the new functionality.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to anticipate all use cases upfront, an alternative
approach is to choose a representation that preserves as much structure as
possible, so that alternative interpreters may be added later on. To do that,
we’re effectively going to enumerate the set of parsers, and ways of
combining them, by defining a type for representing an abstract syntax tree
(AST). To this purpose, we’ll use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type">GADT</a>, that
also expresses that different parsers are indexed by different types. The
initial constructors are split into two sets – primitive ones (the
leaf nodes of the tree), and combinators for composing parsers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>(* Primitive parsers *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Fail</span>      <span>:</span> <span>string</span>            <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Empty</span>     <span>:</span>                       <span>unit</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Return</span>    <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span>                <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Symbol</span>    <span>:</span> <span>char</span>              <span>-&gt;</span> <span>char</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>(* Composition - applicative *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Map</span>       <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Product</span>   <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>t</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>(* Composition - alternative *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Either</span>    <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The primitive parsers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Fail msg</code> - a parser that always fails.</li>
  <li><code>Empty</code> - a parser that succeeds when given empty input.</li>
  <li><code>Return x</code> - a parser that does not consume any input and always returns <code>x</code>.</li>
  <li><code>Symbol c</code> - a parser that matches input when the first character is <code>c</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The applicative interface is what provides sequential composition, as in:
first parse <code>x</code> with parser <code>p1</code>, then parse <code>y</code> with parser <code>p2</code> and combine
their results.</p>

<p>The <code>Either</code> constructor makes it possible to provide alternative execution
paths, i.e. parsers that succeed on different types of input.</p>

<p>As we don’t want to give users direct access to the type, we’ll mechanically
add some smart constructors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>Empty</span>

<span>let</span> <span>fail</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fail</span> <span>m</span>

<span>let</span> <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Return</span> <span>x</span>

<span>let</span> <span>symbol</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>c</span>

<span>let</span> <span>map</span> <span>f</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Map</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>product</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>Product</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>,</span><span>q</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>either</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>Either</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>,</span><span>q</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Having an applicative interface means that it is also possible to leverage
the new syntax extension – the <code>let+ .. and+</code> notation – which I’ve described
<a href="http://jobjo.github.io//2019/04/24/ocaml-has-some-new-shiny-syntax.html">here</a>.
Assuming OCaml 4.08 or the dune
<a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/let-syntax-backported-to-ocaml-4-02/3447">future_syntax stanza</a>
, we can add a syntax module, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Syntax</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>f</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>and</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>product</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition to these, we’ll include an <code>Ops</code> module with infix versions
and some derived combinators:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Ops</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
  <span>open</span> <span>Syntax</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>f</span> <span>p</span>   <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>f</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;|&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>   <span>=</span> <span>either</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>pf</span> <span>px</span> <span>=</span> <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>pf</span> <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>px</span> <span>in</span> <span>f</span> <span>x</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>*&gt;</span>  <span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>_</span> <span>x</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>q</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;*</span>  <span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>   <span>=</span> <span>const</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>q</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before moving on, some of the code examples also assume a few general
utility functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(* Identity *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>id</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span>

<span>(* Const *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>const</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span>

<span>(* Forward composition *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>(</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>c</span>

<span>(* Converting a char list to a string *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>string_of_list</span> <span>:</span> <span>char</span> <span>list</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>string</span>

<span>(* And back again *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>list_of_string</span> <span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>char</span> <span>list</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Their implementation, along with the complete code is available
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jobjo/13376aaea1151100dd7915dedb35d9d7">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="building-simple-parsers">Building simple parsers</h3>

<p>How can we use the API to build actual parsers? Let’s consider a few simple
examples. First, a parser that parses a specific string, i.e. a function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>string</span> <span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>string</span> <span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To implement the <code>string</code> parser, we can use the <code>symbol</code> primitive and fold over the
given string to combine the parsers using applicative (<code>let+ .. and+)</code> syntax:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>string</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>accum</span> <span>c</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>(* Parse 'x' using the 'symbol c' parser *)</span>
    <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span>  <span>=</span> <span>symbol</span> <span>c</span>
    <span>(* Then parse 'xs' using the 'p' parser *)</span>
    <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>p</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>(* Combine 'x' and 'xs' in a string *)</span>
    <span>Printf</span><span>.</span><span>sprintf</span> <span>"%c%s"</span> <span>x</span> <span>xs</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>fold_right</span> <span>accum</span> <span>(</span><span>list_of_string</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, let’s attempt a parser for parsing digits. A version that
detects a single digit may be defined as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>digit</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>list_of_string</span> <span>"0123456789"</span>
  <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>symbol</span>
  <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>fold_left</span> <span>either</span> <span>fail</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Choosing between a list of parsers is a natural generalization of the binary <code>either</code>
combinator, and deserves its own version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>choose</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>fold_left</span> <span>either</span> <span>fail</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We may also generalize the <code>digit</code> definition to take a list of symbols as an argument:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>one_of</span> <span>cs</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span> <span>@@</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>symbol</span> <span>cs</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, <code>digit</code> is achieved by:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>digit</span> <span>=</span> <span>one_of</span> <span>"0123456789"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="hitting-the-boundaries">Hitting the boundaries</h3>

<p>Next, consider a parser that recognizes arbitrary integers? An integer
consists of at least one digit but we don’t know exactly how many. How can we
define a parser that captures this semantics? As a first try:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>digits</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>d</span>  <span>=</span> <span>digit</span>
    <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>ds</span> <span>=</span> <span>either</span> <span>(</span><span>digits</span> <span>()</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>d</span> <span>::</span> <span>ds</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>string_of_list</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>int_of_string</span><span>)</span> <span>@@</span> <span>digits</span> <span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can you spot the problem with the above definition? If not, just try running
it and you’ll find it throwing a <em>stack-overflow</em> exception. The problem is
that the recursive call is never conditional on any base case and is always
eagerly evaluated. We need a way to describe parsers that may consume
arbitrarily large inputs without constructing infinite parsing expressions!
To generalize from the <code>int</code> example, we’re aiming for a combinator with the
following signature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>many</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>list</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One solution would be to introduce a constructor, say <code>Delay</code>,
for representing lazy parsers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Delay</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>

<span>let</span> <span>delay</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>Delay</span> <span>f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is a parser with delayed construction. We may use <code>delay</code> to define
<code>many</code>, as in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span>  <span>=</span> <span>p</span>
    <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>delay</span> <span>@@</span> <span>fun</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>either</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, each step of the recursion is evaluated on demand rather than upfront.
This solution would work well if it weren’t for the more ambitious set of constraints
having to do with pretty printing and symbol extraction. The problem is that
in order to extract all possible symbols of a delayed parser, we’d need to evaluate
it; this would unroll the infinite recursion expressed in the <code>many</code> definition, and
once again kill the stack.</p>

<h3 id="fixing-the-parser-definition"><em>Fixing</em> the parser definition</h3>

<p>Is there any fix for the problem of simultaneously having a finite
traversable representation, and providing sufficient expressive power for
describing infinite parsers? The clue is in the question. A way of expressing
recursive structures without recursion is exactly what is offered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator">fixed-point
combinator</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s extend the parser type with a fixed-point constructor (and also get rid of <code>Delay</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Fix</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>

<span>let</span> <span>fix</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fix</span> <span>f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then use <code>fix</code> as a remedy for the recursiveness of the definition of <code>many</code>,
from above:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>fix</span> <span>@@</span> <span>fun</span> <span>many</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span>  <span>=</span> <span>p</span>
      <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>many</span> <span>in</span>
      <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span>
    <span>in</span>
    <span>either</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that there is <em>no</em> <code>rec</code> keyword in sight. The function <code>fix</code> is just a
handy tool for allowing us to mimic recursive functions. You may be left
wondering how exactly this solves the problem of symbol extraction, given
that we still end up with <code>Fix</code> nodes – functions of type <code>('a t -&gt; 'a t)</code>
– that need to be evaluated. Hopefully, the next sections on interpreting
parsers will bring some clarity on that matter.</p>

<p>Coming back to the example of integer-parsing, here’s how <code>int</code> may be defined
in terms of <code>many</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>d</span>  <span>=</span> <span>digit</span>
  <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>ds</span> <span>=</span> <span>many</span> <span>digit</span> <span>in</span>
  <span>int_of_string</span> <span>@@</span> <span>string_of_list</span> <span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>::</span> <span>ds</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, we may extract the common pattern of parsing one or more times using the same
parser (one or more digits in the example above) by adding a new combinator, as in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given a parser <code>p</code>, the parser <code>many p</code> succeeds if it can apply <code>p</code> <em>at least</em> one
time on its input.</p>

<p>As a side note, the code generously makes use of the new applicative syntax to
demonstrate how it may be used to write declarative code that also avoids
infix operators. As an alternative, we can define the same functions
without relying on the syntax extension; for instance:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(* Requires Ops module to be open *)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>fix</span> <span>@@</span> <span>fun</span> <span>many</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>either</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span><span>.</span><span>cons</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>many</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>cons</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>many</span>…</code></pre></div></div></section></div>

<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ecc0f2aa29b102bf8d67b7d7173e8698c0341ddfdf9757be17595460fbf1791a">Windows one</a> with symbols that I didn't look at.)
on VirusTotal last month, so here is my quick Sunday afternoon lazy analysis.</p>
<p>The binary has its <code>-h</code> option stripped, likely behind a <code>#define</code> to avoid
detection, but some of its parameters are obvious, like specifying
what file to leak, or the kernel base address. The authors didn't check (or care)
that the logging function hasn't been entirely optimized out, leaving a bunch
of strings helping in the reversing process.</p>
<p>The exploit works in four stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the <a href="https://www.halolinux.us/kernel-reference/inode-objects.html">superblock</a>,</li>
<li>Find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode">inode</a> of the file to dump</li>
<li>Find the corresponding page address</li>
<li>Dumps the content of the file.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of <code>/etc/shadow</code>, the default option, the content of the
file is shoved in memory by running the following command in the
background: <code>return system("echo \"whatever\n\" | su - 2&gt; /dev/null")</code>.
In my lab, on a vulnerable Fedora, the exploit is successfully dumping <code>/etc/shadow</code> in a couple of minutes.
Interestingly, there are checks to detect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor_Mode_Access_Prevention">SMAP</a>
and abort if it's present. I didn't manage to understand why the exploit was
failing in its presence.</p>
<p>The crux of the exploit is at <code>0x4092f0</code>, using <code>cpuid</code> as a serializing
instruction, <code>rdtsc</code> for timing, and <code>mfence</code>/<code>lfence</code> as barrier, as
documented in the paper. It's also using some tricks to minimize the amount of
readings, like type-specific functions, for example a kernel address has a
specific <em>format</em>.
Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec">spender</a> for confirming that the gadget used is likely <code>get_user()</code> in the <code>FIOASYNC ioctl</code>,
which was <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/kernel-hardening/patch/20180209133935.811950747@linuxfoundation.org/">fixed in 2018</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KASLR">KASLR</a> is bypassed when present either by
looking at <code>/proc/kallsyms</code> when available to unprivileged users like it used
to be the case on Fedora until ~recently, or by using the generic
bypass from the <a href="https://gruss.cc/files/prefetch.pdf">prefetch side-channel</a> by Gruss and al.
originating from a library called <code>libkaslr</code>. Amusingly, this method is still
working on an up to date Linux, proving again that <a href="https://grsecurity.net/kaslr_an_exercise_in_cargo_cult_security">KASLR is useless at
best</a>.
For systems that don't have the <code>/proc/kallsym</code> file accessible, the exploit
relies on hardcoded offsets, and while only Fedora, ArchLinux and Ubuntu are currently
supported, there are functions to check for Debian and CentOS. It's a bit
surprising to see hardcoded offsets in an exploit with arbitrary read in
2021.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it had a 
<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6461d0988c835e91eb534757a9fa3ab35afe010bec7d5406d4dfb30ea767a62c/detection">0 detection</a>
rate before I published this blogpost.</p>
<p>Attribution is trivial and left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

    <p>If you’re reading this, I’m pretty sure you’ve seen the following pattern over and over again:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creative nonfiction pioneer John McPhee distilled decades of experience and first-hand learnings in a series of essays. (The best of them are now available in a book called “Draft No. 4”.)</li>
  <li>A savvy entrepreneur repackages the advice in a $1000+ cohort-based course.</li>
  <li>Someone takes the course and summarizes what he learned.</li>
  <li>People on Twitter start creating threads summarizing the student’s summaries.</li>
  <li>At some point, the guy who summarized the student’s summaries will get invited to a podcast to summarize his summary of the student’s summary.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish I was kidding.</p>

<p>This is a picture-perfect example of what Sean Blanda calls the <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55974/the-creative-worlds-bullshit-industrial-complex">Creative World’s Bullshit Industrial Complex</a>. But my goal here is not to dunk on anyone. Instead I want to focus on something far more important.</p>

<p>The Bullshit Complex is just a symptom. What’s the underlying cause?</p>

<p>First, let me clarify one thing. While I’m convinced that remixed content is largely a waste of time for writers and readers, it’s a free world out there. Do whatever makes you happy. If you focus on remixed or “curated” content I’ll probably not follow you on Twitter or read your blog, but there’s no reason why you should care about that. Ultimately, it’s your own responsibility to decide how you spend your time and what kind of content you consume.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s talk about entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>In recent years one of the most common pieces of advice for aspiring entrepreneurs has become that you should focus on building an audience. Everyone is screaming it from the rooftops.</p>

<p>So when I started to get into entrepreneurship a few months ago, that’s exactly what I did. I spent a lot of time researching what kind of tweets get attention and set the goal for myself to post at least two tweets per week and two blog posts per month. After all, churning out content regularly is key if you want to build an audience, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=67&amp;v=cubPiuD7_dA&amp;feature=youtu.be">right</a>?</p>

<p>If you need any evidence how serious I was about the whole building an audience thing, here it is: I created a <a href="https://whattotweet.com/">What to Tweet</a> tool because I was struggling to stick to my Twitter schedule.</p>

<p>Looking back at it now I think I largely wasted my time. And more importantly I see so many people falling into the exact same trap.</p>

<p>Their goal is to become entrepreneurs. But instead of building products, they create content. Or even worse, they do research and take courses on how to create content.</p>

<p>But this doesn’t bring them one inch closer to their goal. It’s just a form of procrastination.</p>

<p>While charging money for something you created is <a href="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/free">scary</a>, there is almost zero risk in putting out free content. And if you’re just remixing other people’s content, the intellectual risk is effectively zero. After all, you can always reply “hey, don’t shoot the messenger”.</p>

<p>This trap is particularly dangerous because it feels like you’re making progress while really you don’t.</p>

<p>Aspiring entrepreneurs are not just wasting a lot of time but also lots of money this way. They spend thousands of dollars on courses that teach them how to remix other people’s content more effectively. They buy the latest hyped-up courses that teach them how to craft more effective tweets, blog posts and Youtube videos.</p>

<p>But don’t get me wrong. <em>Having</em> an audience is awesome and I love great content.</p>

<p>What I’m saying is that too many beginners have their priorities backwards and fall into the “build an audience!” trap.</p>

<p>An exemplary plan looks as follows: “I don’t know what product I should create. So I’m planning to create articles or carousels on Linkedin to find my voice and build an audience.” That’s almost verbatim a paragraph from an email I received two days ago.</p>

<p>You can certainly get a lot of followers by churning out remixed content and feel-good platitudes. But everyone seems to forget that not all audiences are alike.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have 2000 followers that you got by posting feel-good platitudes, whereas I only have two followers called Elon Musk and Paul Graham. Would you swap accounts?</p>

<p>With feel-good platitudes and remixed content you’ll only attract fellow beginners. Everyone else recognizes the content immediately for what it is. Hence, the primary value of your much larger audience is that you’re able to sell them a “How to grow your Twitter following” Gumroad course for $47.</p>

<p>A high-quality audience is an endless source of opportunities. A low quality one is at most a Ponzi scheme.</p>

<p>Many people <a href="https://twitter.com/m_ashcroft/status/1364334719970721793">learn</a> this the hard way. They get lured by the promise that they’ll be able to create content effortlessly and build an audience this way. This is exactly what beginners want to hear and hence what gurus are preaching. “Everything is a remix”. So just progressively summarize a bunch of books and then start sharing pieces you remixed from your summaries.</p>

<p>Students of these courses spent months recording videos and writing thousands of words only to discover that they never said anything meaningful.</p>

<p>Valuable content that truly advances the conversation and gets the attention of people you really want to connect with is never effortless. It’s painful. And I’m not talking about some kind of sophisticated editing process, but the writing itself.</p>

<p>In fact, this is how you know that you’re creating valuable content. You should at least be a little scared before you hit the publish button.</p>

<p>Publishing content online is the best way to become visible so that opportunities can find you. But please don’t try to improve your ability to come up with interesting things by reading and connecting ideas just so that you have something to write about.</p>

<p>If you ever notice that you’re trying to “say something interesting”, stop. You’re just going to feed the Creative World’s Bullshit Industrial Complex.</p>

<p>Your main priority always should be to <em>do</em> meaningful things, to solve real-world problems, to be the man in the arena. And if you share what you learn along the way, people will start to listen. Write when you have something meaningful to say, and not to stick to some self-imposed writing schedule.</p>

<p>A hidden benefit of this strategy is that your writing skills become largely irrelevant. It’s certainly true that great writers like John McPhee can make a topic as boring as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54983.Oranges">Oranges</a> exciting. But if you have a great story to tell or learned something important, people will pay attention no matter how bad your writing is. Not convinced? Just look at the essay you’re reading right now.</p>

<p>Save yourself thousands of dollars. Here’s all the writing advice you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share meaningful first-hand experiences.</li>
  <li>Write as if you were emailing a friend, not to impress an imaginary teacher.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I’m definitely scared to publish this essay. This is exactly why I’ll do it.</p>

		<p>Some books are like mirrors. By that I mean that reading them involves a great deal of looking at oneself, both for praise and loathing. Taking a look back in time, reflecting on all those times we thought we were right and we were wrong, bringing back memories of times long gone, some of them painful, most hopefully fun and joyful.</p>
<p>“The Psychology of Computer Programming” is one of those. In every one of its chapters, Dr. Weinberg reflects on the human aspects of programming. It is, most probably, the first book ever written on the subject of the personality, the interactions and the characteristics of software developers. Let me be clear: this book has been written in 1971, and it has been continuously in print until at least the end of the twentieth century, for almost 30 years. This is the stuff of classics.</p>
<p>There has even been a reviewed “anniversary” edition published in 1999, but I bought a copy of the first edition of the book, and besides the delightful look and feel of the pages, representatives of the typography and design of the seventies, the structure, the flow and the discussion of this book make it stand in a class of its own, and represent a hallmark in our field.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Weinberg analyzes programming from both individual and collective points of view, including the issues of education, human resources management, and even programming language design. The author actually devotes a section of his book to explain how the design of a programming language impacts the readability and the subsequent maintainability (or lack thereof) of the programs written in it.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>Regarding team interactions, the author highlights the issues brought from scaling up programming teams: do small teams face the same issues as larger ones? How do communication patterns emerge and evolve? The author takes pleasure in debunking common myths and misconceptions, some of them still held today by managers all over the world: what are the factors that can cause a project to break down in pieces? The answers will surprise you, and you will wonder why nobody had ever told you to read this book first.</p>
<p>Dr. Weinberg also pays close attention to the individual characteristics of programmers. What defines a good programmer? Why do they take pride in their jobs? What kind of incentives should a company offer to their developers? Nice offices or challenging problems? (I think you can guess the answer to that last question.)</p>
<p>In the humble opinion of the author of these lines, software is primarily a social process, and only later a technical feat. Software is no more a technical product than a book is just a printed object. Software is the result of interactions among people, and as such it will reflect all the contradictions, the failures, the wonders and the joy of the people involved in it. Every single piece of software ever written by humans reflects the underlying moods, psyche and interactions of a group of people. As such, studying the psychology of a programmer yields naturally in a process in which, invariably, the software will be better at the end.</p>
<p>I once saw a joke on Twitter, saying that managing programmers was subject to Heisenberg’s Principle, in that observing programmers changes their behavior. I do not think it is a joke, for I believe that all social systems are, actually, quantum-like systems subject to this principle; the actions of the observer will invariably alter the behavior of the observed. And that is OK, as far as I am concerned. If managers are conscious of this fact, and if they can use this to their advantage, they will be able to build sustainable teams.</p>
<p>Maybe Dr. Weinberg took some inspiration from Melvin Conway, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 1967 stated</a> that “organizations design systems mirroring their own communication structures”. Now you start to understand why your microservice architecture is a mess, and no, neither Istio nor Prometheus is going to help you with that.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding recruiting: we all know how hard it is to find and recruit software developers, yet I am appalled to see how many companies do as much as they can to destroy the teams they spent so much time and money to build. Why is this? I can only recommend all human resources managers, all project managers, and all developers as well, to get a copy of this book and, as I said at the beginning of this chapter, to take a good look at ourselves in the mirror. We all need a little bit of introspection, and Dr. Weinberg can help.</p>
<p>Legacy buzzword warning: this book is mostly accessible to general audiences, but there are a few sections where the author assumes a certain experience with programming languages, compilers, hardware design or even project management; and in some cases, with the 1971 versions of those.</p>

      <p><img src="https://justanman.org/images/aol-instant-messenger-shuts-down.png" alt="AOL Instant Messenger ‘Running Man’ waving goodbye"></p>
<p>In the early 2000s social media sites like Facebook and Twitter weren’t commonplace yet. Even text messages, at ten cents each, were something to be rationed. For many teenagers the primary means of communication outside school was AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). So when it was announced in October that they were shutting down AIM after 20 years, I felt a wave of nostalgia for the messaging app of my youth.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear when they would be pulling the plug for good, but a high school friend and I planned to be online for the occasion. Their website indicated that AIM would continue to work until the morning of December 15, 2017. Assuming this meant UTC time, that put it going offline sometime after 7:00 PM EST on the 14th.</p>
<p>I wondered: Could I be the last person to sign off? The last person to send a message? Would I have anything profound to say?</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>I decided to research famous last words. First stop: the Book of Revelation. Final chapter, final verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Last words are for fools who haven’t said enough!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too cantankerous. And as a somewhat libertarian leaning person, I wasn’t going to let Karl Marx have the last word.</p>
<p>I’d figure out what to say later and in the meantime started reading about the technology behind AIM. I learned about OSCAR, the proprietary protocol used by AIM and ICQ. Parts of the protocol were documented by AOL in an official SDK. This is what made third-party AIM clients possible. I had used Gaim (now Pidgin) on Linux machines before and indeed, there was even BSFlite, an AIM client for the command line.</p>
<p>AOL’s desktop client no longer worked for me. They had already pulled the iOS app from the App Store. Ditto for Android. Fortunately browser sign on still worked. I was greeted by a familiar interface that supported new features like embedded media and SMS.</p>
<p>I sent a couple test messages from the browser to my phone. Monitoring outbound activity in the Chrome network panel revealed the structure of a request: a simple HTTP POST to a url, with what appeared to be a session ID in the query string and a message body. I tried to send a message using <code>curl</code> and it worked. As long as I was signed on in the browser the request was accepted.</p>
<p>There were several paths to automating this but given the time constraint, something quick and easy would probably suffice. All I had to do was keep sending messages until the server stopped responding.</p>
<p><strong>December 14, 2017: The final countdown</strong></p>
<p>It was almost midnight UTC time. It would be the 15th soon and I didn’t want to miss the shutdown, so I set up a Bash script to run the <code>curl</code> command at one second intervals. Every now and then I had to manually reauthenticate in the browser. It wasn’t elegant but it worked. Now I had to wait…</p>
<p>To pass time I searched Twitter for mentions of AIM’s last day. Plenty of people were reminiscing about their old screen names, but only a handful were actually signing on one last time. I added them to my buddy list and we talked for a bit. One lived in DC, one in Toledo. Another somewhere in Maryland. Two were engineers, one was a wrestling announcer! I made dinner and watched <em>The Office</em> while occasionally checking on the script.</p>
<p>It ran for another six hours until 1:21 AM EST. I witnessed the drama play out in HTTP status codes:</p>
<pre><code>200 OK
200 OK
200 OK
408 Request Timeout
408 Request Timeout
401 Unauthorized
</code></pre><p>And like that, AIM was gone. Requests to aim.com returned an Invalid URL status page. <code>curl</code> returned nothing but 401s.</p>
<p><strong>Epitaph</strong></p>
<p>I examined the script logs and found it – the last message sent on AIM. [1] It was timestamped Fri Dec 15 01:21:42 EST 2017. From me, to me. (I didn’t want to spam anyone.)</p>
<p>I had borrowed the words from Leonard Nimoy’s final tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🖖</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few days ago I realized something. I don’t like writing.</p><p>I realized it because I found creative energy to work on programming projects again, and I experience writing programs differently from how I experience having to write. Even the turn of phrase “having to write” betrays my disposition toward the craft.</p><p>When I’m very excited to build products or just program computers for the joy of programming, I dread going to sleep and every part of me <em>cannot wait</em> to wake up and write code again. I’ve never felt that about writing. Writing has always been a chore. I think I’ve known this all along, but have never been able to admit this to myself until now.</p><p>When you read anything about anything anywhere, it tells you what great [INSERT CALLING HERE] do. Great startup founders and engineers write well and write a lot because without clear writing there is no clear thinking. I think I bought into that too much for my own good. So it feels liberating to say: <strong>I hate writing.</strong> It’s painful and laborious and every good piece of writing I make feels like delivering a baby. A rewarding experience for sure, but I think even the most loving of mothers would stop being so loving if she had to deliver a new baby every week.</p><p>One thing that duped me is a lot of positive reenforcement. My best pieces of writing get tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of readers, and that gives me an addicting sense of elation. I certainly never expected to make money doing it, but enough of you find my writing sufficiently interesting to offer the ultimate seal of approval— you transfer money from your wallet into mine. I deeply appreciate it, and deeply appreciate you spending time on reading my essays, but unfortunately this isn’t sufficient impetus for me to produce good work. When I’m forced to write on a schedule, my writing sucks and my life is miserable.</p><p>Which is a good reminder why some of my writing is good. It’s good when I have something important to say. Important things are hard to say by definition— if they were easy people would have already talked them out and they probably would have lost their importance. At least they’re hard to say for me. So when I do it it’s always very slow and painful, and it turns out good because I say something that matters to me in a way that nobody else bothered or managed to say. With my particular idiosyncrasies the intersection of that and the business of running a newsletter is an empty set.</p><p>So please stop paying me. For the folks that have prepaid, I’m not exactly sure how Substack tooling handles this situation, but shoot me an email and I’ll figure out how to return a prorated amount.</p><p>I will continue writing. When I have something important to say, I’ll go through the pain necessary for me to say it. I’ll also write about my observations as I pursue my product and programming work— technical, anthropological, and simply keeping you up to do date on what I’m up to. I don’t expect you’ll be hearing from me less often. In fact, I’m hoping this will allow me to write more. But owing people weekly essays as a matter of business isn’t my tao. For all the reasons above, and primarily because it makes the essays suck, and I don’t like producing bad work.</p><p>Until next week, hopefully. Slava.</p></div></div>]]>

You might recognise the first three names from early Smalltalk papers from Xerox PARC. They produced a rather nice Smalltalk system with the unusual virtue that both the image and the Virtual Machine are open source - i.e. free, gratis and "no charge to you sir".<br><span>Finding Out More About Squeak</span><br>To find most of the web resources for Squeak, look at the <a href="http://www.squeak.org/" rel="self">Squeak.Org</a> site. There are lots of pointers to information about Smalltalk, instructions for downloading Squeak, tutorials, FAQs etc. I won't waste space by duplicating any of it here. I do most strongly recommend that you read many of them.<br><span>Squeak runs on...</span><br>Macs, iPhones, most UNIX &amp; Linux systems, Windows of various versions, <a href="http://www.riscos.org/" rel="external">RISC OS</a> and some obscure specialised systems. See the above mentioned master page for details on how to get the files.<br>I’ve spent many years making Smalltalk available for RISC OS and other <a href="http://www.arm.com/" rel="self">ARM</a> based systems including the original Acorn Archimedes &amp; RPC desktops, the Active Book, an early prototype version of the Compaq ‘iPaq’ handheld, the Interval Research ‘MediaPad’, an HP prototype pad-thing and other stuff still secret.<br><span>New News of a newsish nature</span><br>2013 - Squeak is back on RISC OS! Those nice people at the <a href="http://www.rowledge.org/tim/squeak/www.raspberrypi.org" rel="external">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> sent me a Pi; it has RISC OS on it and I’ve been getting things working on it. </p><p><img alt="IMG_0467" src="http://www.rowledge.org/tim/squeak/files/img_0467.jpg" width="519" height="388"><br></p><div><p>It runs quite nicely in general; the Pi’s RISC OS graphics kernel is a bit slow seeming right now but there is work being done that should improve that significantly. It supports <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="external">Scratch</a> as well and runs it decently - though there is a lot of work being done to improve that, too. Somewhat perversely, MIT decided to rewrite Scratch in Flash (belch) ‘for better browser support’ and seem to have abandoned the ‘old’ Squeak based system. Since Flash doesn’t run on RISC OS  nor indeed on ARM systems in general, we’ll be supporting ‘old’ Scratch for a while.<br>You can download a copy of Squeak for RISC OS from the central <a href="http://www.squeakvm.org/riscos" rel="external">squeakvm.org </a>site.<br>Currently I’m working for the Pi foundation to improve Scratch under Raspbian (their linux version) by rewriting some of the more egregiously ugly code, improve algorithms, tweak vm configurations and so on. As of early-2014 it’s significantly faster than the original version with a fair bit more to come. A major project has been <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/test-tims-nuscratch-beta/" rel="external">porting the code forwar</a>d to the latest Squeak image so that it can run on the most modern VMs; right now it is using the ‘StackVM’. I hope to get the newer design dynamic translating VM working soon.<br>When and if possible all of this will get moved over to RISC OS but making a living comes first!</p><p> <span>Building the VM with VMMaker</span><br>I also developed and for many years maintained the VMMaker package, the lump of Squeak code that defines and generates the bulk of the VM. See the VMMaker page on the <a href="http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak" rel="self">Squeak Swiki</a> for more info. You can fetch the VMMaker package from <a href="http://map1.squeakfoundation.org/sm" rel="self">SqueakMap</a> or use the SqueakMap tool in the image and look for (guess what) VMMaker. You will also need a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" rel="external">SubVersion</a> client so that you can fetch the handwritten parts of the VM source code from the repository.<br>Once you have mastered the complexities of the VMMaker and successfully built yourself a custom VM you should download<a href="http://www.rowledge.org/resources/tim's-Home-page/Squeak/SqueakVMBuilderCertificate.pdf" rel="self"> this certificat</a>e to attest to your mighty geekiness.<br><span>Stuff wot I wrot</span><br>	•	I contributed a chapter describing the structure, function, design and implementation of virtual machines and the lowest level of Smalltalk code to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Squeak-Open-Personal-Computing-Multimedia/dp/0130280917" rel="external">"Squeak: Open Personal Computing and Multimedia"</a> edited by Mark Guzdial and Kim Rose, published by Prentiss-Hall.

<h2>
History:
</h2>
In the late 1970s and early 1980s (the good old days of "hobby computing") before
the IBM PC and its clones took over the world, various microprocessor based kits
appeared on the hobbyist market. You could build a Z80-based board with 8K of
RAM, and with its hexadecimal keypad and LED display you could run simple
programs laboriously keyed in hex.
<p>
The first generation commercial machines also appeared - usually based on
the 8080 or the Z80 or 6502. The Commodore PET was one of the early sucesses
and it, along with the Commodore 64, Sinclair's three machines (ZX80, ZX81 and
Spectrum) and the BBC Micro probably accounted for most of the infant home-computer
market in Britain.
</p><p>
I decided on a different approach. Unhappy with the concept of having to re-live
the glory-days of the
<a href="http://www.computer50.org/mark1/MM1.html">
Manchester MkI
</a>
with the hobby-boards fraternity (!), and unhappy with the straitjacketed
architectures and joke operating systems of the 1st generation home computers,
I yearned for more. Specifically, what I wanted was something
more like a Unix clone at home. I was used to V7 Unix on the PDP-11 at university
and wasn't keen to step backwards 10 years to the technology of CP/M and BASIC
programming.
<br>
<i>
I wasn't to know that eight years later a guy called Linus
Torvalds was going to think the same thoughts and do much the same things. The
big difference was that he was in the right place and the right time and 
had internet connectivity - I didn't have any of these advantages!
</i>
</p><p>
I went off and built myself a 6809 based computer with 64K of RAM, a 360K
floppy disk drive and an RS232 interface which could drive a glass-TTY.
Please remember that this was 1982. Hard disks, megabytes of RAM and other
familiar modern things were a long way off.
</p><p>
After going through the usual hard work of writing a BIOS complete with
an S-records downloader, I was in a position to write myself an operating
system. Preliminary work on OMU started in late 1983. My earliest surviving
printouts of the sources on yellowed, faded lineprinter paper show that the
bulk of the work on OMU dates from March/April/May 1984.
</p><p>
Work was not helped by the fact that I was having to write a 'C' compiler
in parallel, but certainly by mid 1984 I had a perfectly usable O/S with a
primitive shell, a port of Unix 'ed' for an editor, and with 'fsck' and other
such tools available to repair the filestore disks when they got damaged by
miswrites from the rather dodgy floppy-disk hardware. I remember taking
the machine home over Christmas 1984 and typing up several reports using it
on the kitchen table.
</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
I just found this photo of the 1984 machine amongst a box of slides taken
over that Christmas. It appears to be the only photo of the machine I ever
took at the time.
<p>
At this point in its evolution, the hardware was mostly on one double
eurocard, with a floppy-disk interface piggybacked onto it. The floppy-disk
drive is in the metal box at front, and the bigger metal box at the RHS
of the PCBs is the power-supply.

</tbody></table>
</p><h2>
Features and misfeatures list:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Tiny (24K) Kernel.
</li><li>
V7 Unix-compatable filestore (doesn't support triple-indirection blocks).
Not exactly critical on a floppy-disk-only system!
</li><li>
Normal Unix-style use of /dev/* files to interface to devices.
</li><li>
Mountable/dismountable filestores as expected.
</li><li>
Shell is built-in to save space, rather than run as a process.
</li><li>
tty driver is exceedingly minimal, but functional.
</li><li>
No true multitasking (see below).
</li><li>
UIDs and GIDs not implemented. They're ignored on the filestore, and the
process table doesn't bother to hold them. Any files created would be given
UID = GID = 0.
</li></ul>
<p>
The lack of an MMU and the small amount of RAM available meant that I
decided against trying to implement true multitasking. Instead (like DOS
as it happens) I came up with a scheme whereby a process could launch another
process, but would have to wait for it to complete. Clunky, but it worked
OK.
</p><p>
For your entertainment (or possibly if you're interested in the possibility
of porting my old O/S to more modern hardware like that old XT that's
gathering dust under your table) here's a downloadable copy of my
final version of the 6809 OMU as it stood in 1987:
</p><center>

</center>
<p>
In order to make any use of OMU, I had compiled up a set of utilities like
'ed' and 'mount' and 'fsck'. Sadly I don't think I can make their sources
downloadable here as they were based on the Unix V7 sources for which we had
a Bell Labs "academic use" licence at the university.
</p><p>
<strong>
<span color="#FF0000">
NEW!
</span>
</strong>
The above packages now include some utilities which I did write from scratch:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>adb</strong>
An interactive disassembler. (Doesn't debug core-dumps though, just lets
you look at code in files).
</li><li><strong>aka</strong>
("Also Known As") - finds other files hardlinked to the one mentioned on the
command-line.
</li><li><strong>chbase</strong>
Prints the number(s) given on the command-line in octal, decimal &amp; hex.
</li><li><strong>hex</strong>
Makes Motorola S-record files for sending to the 6809. Usually runs on a
host machine (a PDP-11 originally).
</li><li><strong>ida</strong>
An intelligent disassembler - shares source-code with 'adb' above.
</li><li><strong>sh</strong>
The tiny shell needed by the OMU kernel. OMU runs this as if it was the
'init' process.
</li><li><strong>sirius</strong>
An interactive disk-examination program.
</li><li><strong>unhex</strong>
A program to convert Motorola S-records into an OMU-loadable file. Usually
runs on the 6809 itself of course.
</li></ul>
Sorry, no documentation, but the source-code should be documentation enough!
<p>
I
<strong>
don't
</strong>
suggest any modern user of OMU on a 6809 tries getting GNU utilities running
with it! Bear in mind that V7 sources would compile into a smaller executable
than any modern GNU equivalents. With the 64K memory-address limitation of my
6809, this was important! The BIOS and O/S accounted for about 24K of this, so
user-programs were limited to about 40K total. I never did complete my
page-switched 256K memory system.....
</p><p>
Mind you, if you're contemplating porting to a 68000 or IBM-PC, the size
constraints will be much less of a problem.
</p><hr>
<p>
My work on OMU was pretty much unnoticed by anyone else in the world (we didn't
have an internet connection in those days), but others in the Electrical
Engineering dept at Swansea University saw the potential to port OMU to one of
several 68000 single-board-computers which began to appear in the department
from about 1984/85 onwards.
</p><p>
My colleage Terry Barnaby and I were variously involved with porting OMU
to several of these 68000 based SBCs. Terry did most of the work!
The first stage was merely to take OMU and get it to run on the new
hardware much as my 6809 version was doing already. This was accomplishe
reasonably quickly, complete with the addition of the OMU's first driver
for a hard-disk.
The much greater memory-addressing ability of the 68000 coupled with the
fact that the SBCs typically had 256K of RAM on board meant that this version
of OMU soon featured some multi-tasking capabilities (though with no MMU
available the processes had to be well-behaved).
</p><p>
For convenience, the details of the filestore layout and the system-call
interface of 68000 OMU was designed to duplicate those of the commercial 68000
V7 Unix system made by "Codata" (we had just taken delivery of two of these
units to augment the aging PDP-11).
It is I think a credit to OMU's potential that
it soon became possible to compile programs on the Codata, and run them on
OMU with no problems. Indeed, it was also possible to take system binaries
shipped with the Codata and run them on OMU too - an easy way to get 'vi'
and other state-of-the-art (!) software on OMU without having to dig out the
sources and recompile!
</p><center>

</center>
<p>
Terry Barnaby and another of his colleages Tim Ingersoll then made some
fundamental changes to the message-handling abilities of the 68000 OMU port to
make it suitable for Real-Time signal processing and control applications.
This was after all what the two of them really
wanted as part of their Ph.D projects...! In 1988 they finished their
projects, wrote up and left. Part of their legacy was the RTOS version of OMU,
and I managed to salvage a set of sources for that too:
</p><center>

</center>
<p>
If any reader of these pages feels suitably daring they may be able to
beat me to the target of porting OMU (probably working from Terry's and my
initial 68000 version above) to the IBM PC. I consider that there really is no
point in aiming for the 386 processor machines onwards as Linux already does
everything you could hope for on that class of machines.
</p><p>
It does however seem that there is mileage in starting with the boot-loader
that comes with
<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/">
FreeDOS
</a>,
and getting OMU to run on 8086/80286 machines of which there must be
<strong>
loads
</strong>
lying around virtually unwanted these days.
</p><p>
If you do decide to try such a thing, then I wish you the best of luck and
I'll offer any email help I can. My email address is in the README file
included with the any of the sets of downloadable sources.
</p><h2>
Acknowledgements:
</h2>
My thanks go to Terry and Tim whose work in enhancing OMU is credited here
and really should have been reflected in a name-change from OMU back in the
Eighties! (I never did get it straight in my mind as to whether the "one man"
mentioned in the title were there to signify the number of authors or
the number of simultaneous users. Either way, neither was very relevant once
as the software started its modest spread in the department.)
<p>
My thanks also go to Alan Cox (he of Linux networking and kernel hacking fame)
without whose prodding this page might never have been written.

            <p>To sign kids up for our city’s Little League baseball program, you have to prove that they’re residents, which is reasonable. What’s not reasonable is the amount of information you have to provide on the registration website. You have to upload scans of a document in each of 3 categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proof of Residency 1</strong>
Choose one of the following: Driver’s license, School records, Vehicle records, Employment records, Insurance documents</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Residency 2</strong>
Choose one of the following: Welfare/child care records, Federal records, State records, Local records, Support payment records, Homeowner or tenant records, Military records</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Residency 3</strong>
Choose one of the following: Voter’s registration, Utility bills, Financial records, Medical records, Internet, cable, or satellite bills</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That alone is ripe for identity theft, but couple it with their privacy policy which includes this (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without limitation, this typically requires the use of certain personal information, including registration data, event data, and other personal information, to provide program information, <strong>special offers or services through Little League and/or its trusted sponsors, partners, or licensees</strong>, to fulfill your requests for information or products/services, to maintain a list of verified and eligible participants, to maintain a list of volunteers and provide them with the operating tools to manage leagues, or to respond to your inquiries about our programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, you have to upload your most private information and agree to allow them to do as they like with it, including sharing it with whomever they like for any reason they choose.</p>
<p>This is unacceptable.</p>

Lambda came out of incubator Y Combinator, before which he lived in his two-door Honda Civic and scalped soccer tickets at Stanford Stadium to get by. Prior to Bay Area entrepreneurship, he did a two-year mission to the Ukraine where he learned Russian and knocked on lots of doors. The interview was conducted via Zoom with Austen in Southern Utah, from where he routinely tweets out enviable photography of Utah’s stunning landscape.</h5><p><strong>Your posts are some of the most uplifting things in my feed. They’re either screenshots from an internal Slack or a retweet, and it’s a Lambda student saying: I went from making $20,000 in some service job, and now I'm making $80,000/year doing something technical at (say) Cisco, and you've totally changed my life. </strong></p><p><strong>One thing you often post that I think isn’t obvious to people who don't run a socio-economic escalator is all the necessary polish and look-and-feel of being part of the bougie techie class. For example, how you have this email protocol to set up a meeting. Or that if you think you're underpaid, you go in and you say, </strong><em><strong>screw you, pay me more or I leave</strong></em><strong>. It's intriguing that you don’t only have to educate them to turn them into front end engineers, you also have to teach them the social skills around that to become that bougie techie person.</strong></p><p>That's one of the really weird things: The hiring process is not just a filter for skills, it's also a filter for class. And people don't talk about or acknowledge that. It's very clear in all these protocols that we have in tech that you and I understand, you have to learn them the hard way. I'll give you a couple of examples. When I was in sixth grade, I was selling stuff on eBay. I was just this kid trying to hustle, and I had this mentor/entrepreneur who came into high school every now and then and just talked with us. And I was like, okay, real talk! What do I need to do to be taken seriously, because nobody takes me seriously because I'm a 15-year-old kid? And he sat me down and he said: <em>We are going to start using this thing called Gmail</em>. <em>I'm going to send you an invite, and you're going to set up firstname.lastname@gmail.com, no numbers, no nonsense, nothing else, you're going to have no signature, and you're only ever going to send text emails for the rest of your life.</em> <em>That's step one</em>. He just walked me through all this really, really basic stuff. </p><p>There was this other time I was in college…I was hustling and trying to get into startups and there was this guy at a conference I wanted to work with, so I went up and talked to him. And I said <em>what can I do to be like you? </em>He gave me his business card and said <em>just ping me next week</em>. </p><p>I spent hours and hours and hours looking up what <em>ping me</em> meant. I couldn't find anything. So eventually I called somebody and said <em>hey, this guy said ping me. What does that mean?</em> <em>How do I ping? </em>And that person was like, <em>no, no, it’s a call or an email or anything really, just reach out to them. Doesn’t matter how.</em> <em>That's all that ping means</em>. <em>You know, like a cell tower. Ping!</em> I was like, <em>ohhhhhhhh!</em> There's so much little stuff like that. Another classic example is intros, right? Or using Google Calendar. I didn't know how to use Google Calendar until I showed up in my first job. Someone tells me, <em>I am gonna put some time on your calendar</em>. And I think: <em>Oh, I guess I have a calendar</em>. That's not obvious if you don't come from, frankly, a certain class. But all of those things are important; if you don't intro somebody the right way to a VC, they know you're a dunce, automatically. There’s nobody that sits you down and says <em>hey, you're gonna say thank you so-and-so, moving you to BCC</em>. It's not hard, but nobody ever tells you that anywhere.</p><h4>I've heard it described as ‘the bottom 1000 universities’: Assume there's some algorithm that spits out the combination of <em>is expensive</em> and <em>is ineffective</em>. There are at least 1000 universities in the US that should cease to exist. There are many universities that net do more harm than good.</h4><p><strong>There's no tech charm school that teaches you how to do all that stuff.</strong></p><p>Totally. And I'm sure there's more stuff. When one of our first students got hired at Uber, he showed up with his laptop. They tell him: <em>you're a mobile developer</em>. And he's like, <em>I can't be a mobile developer, I don't have a phone</em>. He didn't have a smartphone. So he called me freaking out: <em>What am I gonna do!? Uber wants to hire me. I don't have a smartphone.</em> I told him: <em>Uber does not care about that, Uber’s gonna have a thousand phones, that's the least of Uber’s worries. They're gonna give you a laptop too.</em> </p><p>Then he shows up to work on day one and they tell him: <em>Alright, you know, put in your bank account information here to get direct deposit.</em> He's like, <em>no just cut me a check and I’ll run to the check-cashing store.</em> </p><p>The Uber people reached out to me and said: <em>We don’t know if this is going to work.</em> I was like, <em>he's a smart guy, it’s just that he doesn't have a bank account</em>. So now we set up bank accounts for every student that doesn't have a bank account. The best way I think to describe Lambda School is the American-Dream-as-a-service. </p><p><strong>Wow. That’s the corporate anthem right there.</strong></p><p>(Laughs.)</p><p><strong>There so much cultural encoding in an interview which, as you said, is just filtering for class. But…as these are technical people, there’s actually an objective standard of merit. </strong></p><p>There are a whole swath of white collar jobs that the interview process literally is like, <em>Hey, I'm gonna play a little verbal tennis with you and see if you can stand your ground and if you can, you get the job</em>. That's probably the average white collar job.</p><h4>That's one of the really weird things: The hiring process is not just a filter for skills, it's also a filter for class. And people don't talk about or acknowledge that. </h4><p><strong>Speaking of other jobs, do you see Lambda expanding to other fields? Is that even possible? </strong></p><p><strong>The thing that obviously aligns incentives is to look at education as a hard-nosed business proposition. I'm sure you personally care, but the reason why you care as a business owner is because you want them to get the job because otherwise you're not gonna get paid, right? You’ve invested a year and a half in this person, and they can't blow it up because they don’t know about direct deposits, so you fix that. Which is good, and certainly a lot better than the business model universities have. But that model only works if there's some pretty predictable future stream of income along with pretty predictable employment demand. Can you imagine non-technical professions like trucking and nursing that have high demand and high wages? </strong></p><p>The cool thing about the incentive alignment is that we're not going to train you to be a sociologist, because it just doesn't work. A common critique of the ISA model is: <em>oh, now people aren't going to study poetry anymore.</em> And my response to that is: <em>yeah, we're not a university, we're a trade school</em>. The university has 18 million things that it does for you, and we cut cut off a tiny sliver of that, which is: we're going to help you get a better job, we're going to help you improve your state in life. That's all we do. </p><p>There are actually more high-paying jobs available than there are people to fill those roles. And that's true all over the place. I think about it as an optimization problem. You've got all this latent human potential, and it's just kind of bouncing around. Sometimes it goes to school, and it picks stuff at random to study, and you know what you know because of who you’re surrounded by.</p><p>One aspect of Lambda School that I think is underappreciated is a whole lot of people come in having no idea of what software is, having no idea that there's such a thing as a software engineer. We have people who join and think it's like, <em>I'm gonna fix printers</em>. They know that tech is a high-paying field, but they're not surrounded it. If you're in the inner city, or in a rural area, you don't know a computer programmer. </p><p>One way to think about Lambda is like fintech: You have all these transactions that are moving all over the place, but what makes it all work is a clearinghouse that moves all the money to where it needs to go. I think of Lambda as kind of an economic clearinghouse: Here's all of the untapped human potential, here's all the would-be labor, and over here’s all the jobs that need to be done. There's nothing connecting the two right now other than sheer happenstance and going to university, or maybe you hear that there's a good job over here somewhere.</p><p>But right now the situation is not: <em>I'm making $50k, here's my skill set and my interest, I want to make $90k</em>. Somebody should be able to tell you how to do that, and right now, nobody can. That’s crazy. More than half of GDP is just people working, and that's completely unoptimized. </p><p><strong>Right. Even I, who came from a middle-class background and went to the university track, it seemed like a recently poorly-managed process and I only ended up in science and technology by sheer happenstance…</strong></p><p>You stumbled in, yeah? I feel the same way, and the interesting thing now is, depending on which way you happen to stumble, you can end up fabulously rich or destitute based on your stumblings. </p><h4>The other broken piece is the notion that you go to school once for 10 years when you're 18, and you'll be able to ride that for the rest of your career. That’s probably false for a whole lot of people.</h4><p><strong>So this model you’re describing, where you basically connect people from one income level to another higher one via various different processes. I’m curious what other connections you can imagine existing. </strong></p><p>The way to answer that is to see where all the shortages are, where are people trying to hire and those people don’t exist? Tech is an obvious one, but it’s all over the place in …</p></div></div>

    <p>GTA Online. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/9vgo0g/how_the_fuck_are_20_minute_load_times_acceptable/">Infamous</a> for its slow loading times. Having picked up the game again to finish some of the newer heists I was <em>shocked</em> (/s) to discover that it still loads just as slow as the day it was released 7 years ago.</p>
<p>It was time. Time to get to the bottom of this.</p>
<h2 id="Recon"><a href="#Recon" title="Recon"></a>Recon</h2><p>First I wanted to check if someone had already solved this problem. Most of the results I found pointed towards anecdata about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/01/why-does-gta-v-take-so-long-to-load-7041927/">how the game is so sophisticated</a> that it needs to load so long, stories on how the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/271590/discussions/0/217690940938819317/">p2p network architecture</a> is rubbish (not saying that it isn’t), some elaborate ways of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/908000-fastest-way-to-load-into-gtao-single-player-first-or-straight-in/">loading into story mode and a solo session after that</a> and a couple of mods that allowed skipping the startup R* logo video. Some more reading told me we could save a whopping 10-30 seconds with these combined!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on my PC…</p>
<h2 id="Benchmark"><a href="#Benchmark" title="Benchmark"></a>Benchmark</h2><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Story mode load time:  ~1m 10s</span><br><span>Online mode load time: ~6m flat</span><br><span>Startup menu disabled, time from R* logo until in-game (social club login time isn't counted).</span><br><span></span><br><span>Old but decent CPU:   AMD FX-8350</span><br><span>Cheap-o SSD:          KINGSTON SA400S37120G</span><br><span>We have to have RAM:  2x Kingston 8192 MB (DDR3-1337) 99U5471</span><br><span>Good-ish GPU:         NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>I know my setup is dated but what on <em>earth</em> could take 6x longer to load into online mode? I couldn’t measure any difference using the story-to-online loading technique <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/kycy7a/gtao_loading_times_using_different_methods/">as others have found before me</a>. Even if it did work the results would be down in the noise.</p>
<h2 id="I-Am-Not-Alone"><a href="#I-Am-Not-Alone" title="I Am (Not) Alone"></a>I Am (Not) Alone</h2><p>If <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/ht4i56/your_average_online_loading_time/">this poll</a> is to be trusted then the issue is widespread enough to mildly annoy more than 80% of the player base. It’s been 7 years R*!</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-0.png" alt="🎵What does the poll say?🎵"></p>
<p>Looking around a bit to find who are the lucky ~20% that get sub 3 minute load times I came across <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdCqDdjp6iU">a</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJzr3qfyCyg">few</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK7BUFx_NGk">benchmarks</a> with high-end gaming PCs and an online mode load time of about 2 minutes. I would <del>kill</del> <em>hack</em> for a 2 minute load time! It does seem to be hardware-dependent but something doesn’t add up here…</p>
<p>How come their story mode still takes near a minute to load? (The M.2 one didn’t count the startup logos btw.) Also, loading story to online takes them only a minute more while I’m getting about five more. I know that their hardware specs are a lot better but surely not 5x better.</p>
<h2 id="Highly-accurate-measurements"><a href="#Highly-accurate-measurements" title="Highly accurate measurements"></a>Highly accurate measurements</h2><p>Armed with such powerful tools as <em>the Task Manager</em> I began to investigate what resources could be the bottleneck.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-1.png" alt="Can you smell it?"></p>
<p>After taking a minute to load the common resources used for both story and online modes (which is near on par with high-end PCs) GTA decides to max out a single core on my machine for four minutes and do nothing else.</p>
<p>Disk usage? None! Network usage? There’s a bit, but it drops basically to zero after a few seconds (apart from loading the rotating info banners). GPU usage? Zero. Memory usage? Completely flat…</p>
<p>What, is it mining crypto or something? I smell code. <em>Really bad code</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Single-thread-bound"><a href="#Single-thread-bound" title="Single thread-bound"></a>Single thread-bound</h2><p>While my old AMD CPU has 8 cores and it does pack a punch, it was made in the olden days. Back when AMD’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://valid.x86.fr/bench/6u7sdy/1">single-thread performance</a> was <em>way</em> behind Intel’s. This might not explain all of the load time differences but it should explain most of it.</p>
<p>What’s odd is that it’s using up <em>just</em> the CPU. I was expecting vast amounts of disk reads loading up resources or loads of network requests trying to negotiate a session in the p2p network. But this? This is probably a bug.</p>
<h2 id="Profiling"><a href="#Profiling" title="Profiling"></a>Profiling</h2><p>Profilers are a great way of finding CPU bottlenecks. There’s only one problem - most of them rely on instrumenting the source code to get a perfect picture of what’s happening in the process. And I don’t have the source code. Nor do I need microsecond-perfect readings - I have 4 minutes’ worth of a bottleneck.</p>
<p>Enter stack sampling: for closed source applications there’s only one option. Dump the running process’ stack and current instruction pointer’s location to build a calling tree in set intervals. Then add them up to get statistics on what’s going on. There’s only one profiler that I know of (might be ignorant here) that can do this on Windows. And it hasn’t been updated in over 10 years. It’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://lukestackwalker.sourceforge.net/">Luke Stackwalker</a>! Someone, please give this project some love :)</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-2.png" alt="The power of statistics compels you!"></p>
<p>Normally Luke would group the same functions together but since I don’t have debugging symbols I had to eyeball nearby addresses to guess if it’s the same place. And what do we see? Not one bottleneck but two of them!</p>
<h2 id="Down-the-rabbit-hole"><a href="#Down-the-rabbit-hole" title="Down the rabbit hole"></a>Down the rabbit hole</h2><p>Having borrowed <em>my friend’s</em> completely legitimate copy of <em>the industry-standard disassembler</em> (no, I really can’t afford the thing… gonna learn to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">ghidra</a> one of these days) I went to take GTA apart.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-3.png" alt="Gibberish Galore"></p>
<p>That doesn’t look right at all. Most high-profile games come with built-in protection against reverse engineering to keep away pirates, cheaters, and modders. Not that it has ever stopped them.</p>
<p>There seems to be some sort of an obfuscation/encryption at play here that has replaced most instructions with gibberish. Not to worry, we simply need to dump the game’s memory while it’s executing the part we want to look at. The instructions have to be de-obfuscated before running one way or another. I had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/glmcdona/Process-Dump">Process Dump</a> lying around, so I used that, but there are plenty of other tools available to do this sort of thing.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-one-It’s…-strlen"><a href="#Problem-one-It’s…-strlen" title="Problem one: It’s… strlen?!"></a>Problem one: It’s… strlen?!</h2><p>Disassembling the now-less-obfuscated dump reveals that one of the addresses has a label pulled out of somewhere! It’s <code>strlen</code>? Going down the call stack the next one is labeled <code>vscan_fn</code> and after that the labels end, tho I’m fairly confident it’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/blob/master/pal/src/safecrt/sscanf.c#L47"><code>sscanf</code></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-4.png" alt="A graph a day keeps the skeptics away"></p>
<p>It’s parsing something. Parsing what? Untangling the disassembly would take forever so I decided to dump some samples from the running process using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x64dbg.com/">x64dbg</a>. Some debug-stepping later it turns out it’s… JSON! They’re parsing JSON. A whopping <strong>10 megabytes</strong> worth of JSON with some <strong>63k item entries</strong>.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>...,</span><br><span>{</span><br><span>    <span>"key"</span>: <span>"WP_WCT_TINT_21_t2_v9_n2"</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"price"</span>: <span>45000</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"statName"</span>: <span>"CHAR_KIT_FM_PURCHASE20"</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"storageType"</span>: <span>"BITFIELD"</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"bitShift"</span>: <span>7</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"bitSize"</span>: <span>1</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"category"</span>: [<span>"CATEGORY_WEAPON_MOD"</span>]</span><br><span>},</span><br><span>...</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>What is it? It appears to be data for a “net shop catalog” according to some references. I assume it contains a list of all the possible items and upgrades you can buy in GTA Online.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing up some confusion: I beleive these are in-game money purchasable items, not directly linked with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Cash_Cards">microtransactions</a>.</strong></p>
<p>But 10 megs? That’s nothing! And using <code>sscanf</code> may not be optimal but surely it’s not that bad? Well…</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-5.png" alt="Ouch!"></p>
<p>Yeah, that’s gonna take a while… To be fair I had no idea most <code>sscanf</code> implementations called <code>strlen</code> so I can’t blame the developer who wrote this. I would assume it just scanned byte by byte and could stop on a <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-two-Let’s-use-a-Hash-…-Array"><a href="#Problem-two-Let’s-use-a-Hash-…-Array" title="Problem two: Let’s use a Hash- … Array?"></a>Problem two: Let’s use a Hash- … Array?</h2><p>Turns out the second offender is called right next to the first one. They’re both even called in the same <code>if</code> statement as seen in this ugly decompilation:</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-6.png" alt="Beggar thy neighbour"></p>
<p>All labels are mine, no idea what the functions/parameters are actually called.</p>
<p>The second problem? Right after parsing an item, it’s stored in an array (or an inlined C++ list? not sure). Each entry looks something like this:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>struct</span> {</span></span><br><span>    <span>uint64_t</span> *hash;</span><br><span>    <span>item_t</span>   *item;</span><br><span>} entry;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>But before it’s stored? It checks the <em>entire</em> array, one by one, comparing the hash of the item to see if it’s in the list or not. With ~63k entries that’s <code>(n^2+n)/2 = (63000^2+63000)/2 = 1984531500</code> checks if my math is right. Most of them useless. You have unique <em>hashes</em> why not use a <em>hash map</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-7.png" alt="Oof!"></p>
<p>I named it <code>hashmap</code> while reversing but it’s clearly <code>not_a_hashmap</code>. And it gets even better. The hash-array-list-thing is empty before loading the JSON. And all of the items in the JSON are unique! They don’t even <em>need</em> to check if it’s in the list or not! They even have a function to directly insert the items! Just use that! Srsly, WAT!?</p>
<h2 id="PoC"><a href="#PoC" title="PoC"></a>PoC</h2><p>Now that’s nice and all, but no one is going to take me seriously unless I test this so I can write a clickbait title for the post.</p>
<p>The plan? Write a <code>.dll</code>, inject it in GTA, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook">hook</a> some functions, ???, profit.</p>
<p>The JSON problem is hairy, I can’t realistically replace their parser. Replacing <code>sscanf</code> with one that doesn’t depend on <code>strlen</code> would be more realistic. But there’s an even easier way.</p>
<ul>
<li>hook strlen</li>
<li>wait for a long string</li>
<li>“cache” the start and length of it</li>
<li>if it’s called again within the string’s range, return cached value</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like:</p>

<p><a href="https://mattj.io/posts/">Click here to go to all posts</a>. <em>Also published on <a href="https://mattjoseph.medium.com/create-animated-gif-and-webp-from-videos-using-ffmpeg-f1012267935a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a></em></p>

<p><em>A guide to using FFmpeg to create all the animated content you want.</em></p>

<p>Whether it’s for a website, a presentation, or sharing a fun clip with a friend on chat, you might want to convert a video to an animated GIF or animated WebP. Unfortunately, the visual tools for doing this vary by your operating system. Additionally, most conversion tools don’t support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the WebP format</a>, even in 2021. WebP is based on VP8, a relatively recent video codec standard compared to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GIF image format</a>.</p>

<p>So, this guide is for those who are willing to learn a bit of terminal in order to convert any video to the animated format of their choosing. The best part: this will work on all major operating systems and gives you all the control of the output you could want!</p>


<figcaption>Example GIF of typing "GIF" on a mechanical keyboard</figcaption>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To use this guide, you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic knowledge of how to open and use the terminal on your operating system. If you need a cheat sheet or introductory guides, check out <a href="https://terminalcheatsheet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terminal Cheat Sheet</a>.</li>
  <li>FFmpeg v4+ installed on your operating system and executable from your path. Here are some suggested places to learn down to do this:
    <ul>
      <li>macOS: <a href="https://superuser.com/a/624562" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://superuser.com/a/624562</a></li>
      <li>Windows: <a href="https://video.stackexchange.com/a/20496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://video.stackexchange.com/a/20496</a></li>
      <li>Linux: Use your preferred package manager (e.g., <code>sudo apt install ffmpeg</code> on Ubuntu)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-isffmpeg">What is&nbsp;FFmpeg?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a large suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For our purposes, we will use it to convert between formats, such as videos to GIFs or animated WebP. It has many uses, so I recommend checking it out for all your video processing needs!</p>

<h2 id="before-you-start-make-sure-you-can-run-ffmpeg-from-yourterminal">Before you start: make sure you can run FFmpeg from your&nbsp;terminal</h2>

<p>Since all of these commands require FFmpeg, we need to make sure it’s available.</p>

<p>Open your terminal, and run this:</p>



<p>If FFmpeg is available, you will note output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>FFmpeg version 4.3.1 Copyright © 2000–2020 the FFmpeg developers
...
</code></pre></div></div>


<figcaption>Checking the FFmpeg version on Linux</figcaption>

<p>Version 4 or higher of FFmpeg is recommended for this guide.</p>

<p>If you get an output that says something similar to <code>command not found: ffmpeg -version</code>, then check the <strong>Prerequisites</strong> section above and make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system.</p>

<h2 id="when-should-i-use-an-animated-gif-versus-an-animatedwebp">When should I use an animated GIF versus an animated&nbsp;WebP?</h2>

<p>This depends on the quality, size, and support you want for your output. Modern browsers have support for animated WebP and the quality tends to be higher, but the processing power required is also higher.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>This guide serves as a brief introduction to using FFmpeg to create an animated GIF or animated WebP from a video, but there is so much more you can do with the tool. There are also many options that FFmpeg supports for these formats that are not covered.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="entry-content">
<p>Beer. Everybody likes to drink it. Nobody likes to pay for it. Still, the cost of a beer stings more or less depending on where in the world you’re drinking.</p>
<p>Expensivity wondered just how much the cost of beer differs from country and the effect the price of beer has on national consumption. We researched the price of a beer around the world and used World Health Organization statistics to figure out who’s drinking it all.</p>
<p><em>All prices are in US dollars. All beers are 33cl (330ml) bottles.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<ul><li><strong>Qatar</strong> has the <strong>most expensive beer in the world</strong>, with an average price of <strong>US$11.26</strong> per 33cl (330ml) bottle.</li><li>The <strong>cheapest beer</strong> is in <strong>South Africa</strong>, where the average price is <strong>$1.68</strong> per bottle.</li><li>The <strong>Czech Republic</strong> has the <strong>highest consumption rate</strong>, with <strong>468 beers</strong> per person per year.</li><li><strong>Germans</strong> spend an average <strong>$1,907.78 per year</strong> on beer, the <strong>top figure</strong> in our study.</li></ul>
<h2><strong>Qatar Wins World Cup for Expensive Beer</strong></h2>
<p>A beer in Qatar is expensive. The mostly Muslim country introduced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/world/middleeast/qatar-tax-alcohol.html">100% tax</a> on alcohol imports ahead of the 2022 World Cup, and visitors need a special permit to drink alcohol. China looks pretty expensive too, but consider that we averaged the price of a hotel beer ($13.61) and a supermarket beer ($1.81). </p>

<p>It’s clear the steep prices are aimed at visitors. Beer is cheapest in South Africa, where a <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-10-26-counting-the-cost-of-cheap-easily-available-alcohol-in-south-africa/">culture of buying in bulk</a> tends to keep prices down.</p>
<h2><strong>The International Beer Index in Full</strong></h2>
<p>Where there is beer, there are beer geeks. Here is Expensivity’s data in full so you can find out exactly what kind of beer culture to expect from country to country. Click the arrows to sort by price, consumption, or total spend.</p>

<p>The ten countries with the highest average annual beer bill each have beer that costs upwards of four bucks. However, second-placed Poland is notable for its 62¢ carry-out beer, suggesting that much of Poland’s $1,738 average beer bill is built up by hotel-faring bachelor parties.</p>
<p>Bosnia is an outlier among the big drinkers: the country is in eighth place for beer consumption by bottle (331/year) but 30<sup>th</sup> for overall spend ($647.21), thanks to an average price that comes in under two bucks.</p>
<h2><strong>Germany Spends the Most On Beer</strong></h2>
<p>Haitians just aren’t that into beer. Spirits account for a whopping<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/973941/alcohol-consumption-latin-america-country-drink-type/"> 97% of booze consumed</a> in Haiti, where people drink fewer than four beers per year on average, with an annual beer bill of $10.02. That’s the lowest beer consumption and spend in our study.</p>

<p>At the other end of the scale, Germans spend just shy of $2k/year on beer. We found 15 countries with more expensive beer than Germany, but the nation sinks 411 bottles per person annually, so it pays the most in total. Germany is known for its<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/beer-culture-this-is-how-germany-drinks/a-19201434"> beer culture</a> and a stringent (delicious) beer purity law that has stood for over 500 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Czechia and Spain Lead Drinking Contest</strong></h2>
<p>So, who’s drinking all the beer? The Czech Republic takes the title, with 468 beers per person per year. However, capital Prague is the fourth most-visited city in Europe and infamous for its bachelor parties (<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/prague-different-type-visitor-after-lockdown">for now at least</a>). Like sunny Spain, in second place, Czechia’s beer consumption may be significantly swelled by visiting merry-makers.</p>

<p>Haiti drinks the least beer, counted per bottle or per spend. Most of the countries with a low beer intake can credit their predominantly Muslim populations for the abstinence. Armenia is an exception. The west Asian country drinks just 40 beers per person annually, with locals favoring<a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/armenia/articles/alcoholic-drinks-you-should-try-in-armenia/"> brandy, vodka, and wine</a>.</p>
<p>Armenians might not drink much beer, but the beer they drink is delicious, cheap, and<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/armenia-might-be-one-oldest-and-youngest-beermaking-countries-world-180964860/"> finely crafted</a>. Wherever you’re drinking in the world, be sure to check out the tradition behind your beer, as well as the cost – nothing adds<a href="https://www.expensivity.com/expensivity-by-the-ounce/"> value</a> to your experience like a beer with a story!</p>

<h3><strong>METHODOLOGY &amp; SOURCES</strong></h3>
<p>We collated the prices of a 330ml bottle of beer in supermarkets around the world using online shops, focusing on well-known beer brands such as Corona and Heineken. When we couldn’t find the price via an online shop, we used <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/">numbeo.com</a>.</p>
<p>To gain an average price, we called up hotels to find out the price of a beer from their lobby bar, and when this wasn’t available, we used menus from bars found online. Once all the data was collected, we calculated the average price in US dollars using <a href="http://xe.com/">xe.com</a>.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/alcohol-total-per-capita-(15-)-consumption-(in-litres-of-pure-alcohol)-with-95-ci">World Health</a> <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/alcohol-consumption-of-pure-alcohol-by-type-of-beverage-(-)">Organisation statistics</a>, we found the amount of alcohol consumption per capita and the percentage of annual beer consumption.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="preword">Preword</h4>

<p>This post contains my own opinions, not the opinions of my employer or any open source groups I
belong or contribute to.</p>

<p>It’s also been rewritten 2½ times, and (I think) reads confusingly in places. But I promised
myself that I’d get it out of the door instead of continuing to sit on it, so here we go.</p>

<hr>

<p>There’s been a decent amount of <del>drama</del> debate in the open source community about <em>support</em>
recently, originating primarily from
<a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771">pyca/cryptography’s decision to use Rust for some ASN.1 parsing routines</a><sup id="fnref:asn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:asn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To summarize the situation: building the latest <code>pyca/cryptography</code> release from scratch now requires
a Rust toolchain. The only currently<sup id="fnref:gccrust" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gccrust">2</a></sup> Rust toolchain is built on <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>, which
supports a (relatively) limited
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CompilerWriterInfo.html">set of architectures</a>. Rust further whittles this
set down into <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">support tiers</a>, with
some targets not receiving automated testing (tier 2) or official builds (tier 3).</p>

<p>By contrast, upstream<sup id="fnref:gcchell" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gcchell">3</a></sup> GCC supports a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/backends.html">somewhat larger</a>
set of architectures. But C<sup id="fnref:c" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:c">4</a></sup>, cancer that it is, finds its way onto every architecture with or
without GCC (or LLVM’s) help, and thereby bootstraps <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">everything</a>
<a href="https://www.gnome.org/">else</a>.</p>

<p>Program packagers and distributors (frequently separate from project maintainers themselves)
are very used to C’s universal presence. They’re so used to it that they’ve built generic
mechanisms for putting entire distributions onto new architectures with
only a single assumption: the presence of a serviceable C compiler.</p>

<p>This is the heart of the conflict: Rust (and many other modern, safe languages) use LLVM for its
relative simplicity<sup id="fnref:simple" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:simple">5</a></sup>, but LLVM does not support either native or cross-compilation to many
less popular (read: niche) architectures. Package managers are increasingly finding that one of
their oldest assumptions can be easily violated, and they’re not happy about that.</p>

<p>But here’s the problem: <em>it’s a bad assumption</em>. The fact that it’s the default
represents an <strong>unmitigated</strong> security, reliability, and reproducibility <em>disaster</em>.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-thought-problem">A little thought problem</h2>

<p>Imagine, for a moment, that you’re a maintainer of a popular project.</p>

<p>Everything has gone right for you: you have happy users, an active development base, and maybe even
corporate sponsors. You’ve also got a CI/CD pipeline that produces canonical releases of your
project on tested architectures; you treat any issues with uses of those releases as a bug in the
project itself, since you’ve taken responsibility for packaging it.</p>

<p>Because your project is popular, <strong>others</strong> also distribute it: Linux distributions, third-party
package managers, and corporations seeking to deploy their own controlled builds. These others have
slightly different needs and setups and, to varying degrees, will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build your project with slightly (or completely) different versions of dependencies</li>
  <li>Build your project with slightly (or completely) different optimization flags and other potentially
ABI-breaking options</li>
  <li>Distribute your project with insecure or outright broken defaults</li>
  <li>Disable important security features because other parts of their ecosystem haven’t caught up</li>
  <li>Patch your project or its build to make it “work” (read: compile and not crash immediately) with
completely new dependencies, compilers, toolchains, architectures, and environmental constraints</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t know about <em>any</em> of the above until the bug reports start rolling in: users will report
bugs that have already been fixed, bugs that you explicitly document as caused by unsupported
configurations, bugs that <em>don’t make any sense whatsoever</em>.</p>

<p>You struggle to debug your users’ reports, since you don’t have access to the niche
hardware, environments, or corporate systems that they’re running on. You slowly burn out
as an unending torrent of already fixed bugs that never seem to make it to your users. Your
user base is unhappy, and you start to wonder why you’re putting all this effort into
project maintenance in the first place. Open source was supposed to be fun!</p>

<p>What’s the point of this spiel? It’s <em>precisely</em> what happened to <code>pyca/cryptography</code>:
nobody asked them whether it was a good idea to try to run their code on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA-RISC">HPPA</a>, much less
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/390">System/390</a><sup id="fnref:s390" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:s390">6</a></sup>; some packagers just went ahead
and did it, and are frustrated that it no longer works. People just <em>assumed</em> that it
would, because there is <em>still</em> a norm that everything flows from C, and that any
host with a halfway-functional C compiler should have the entire open source ecosystem
at its disposal.</p>

<h3 id="reflections-on-trusting-random-platforms">Reflections on trusting random platforms<sup id="fnref:rott" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rott">7</a></sup></h3>

<p>Security-sensitive software<sup id="fnref:security" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:security">8</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:reliability" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reliability">9</a></sup>, <em>particularly</em> software written
in unsafe languages, is <strong>never</strong> secure in its own right.</p>

<p>The security of a program is a function of its own design and testing,
<em>as well as</em> the design, testing, and basic correctness of its underlying platform: everything from
the userspace, to the kernel, to the compilers themselves. The latter
is an <strong>unsolved problem</strong> in the <em>very best of cases</em>: bugs are <em>regularly</em>
found in even the most mature compilers (Clang, GCC) and their most mature backends (x86, ARM). Tiny
changes to or differences in build systems can have profound effects at the binary level, like
<a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2018/08/when-aslr-is-not-really-aslr---the-case-of-incorrect-assumptions-and-bad-defaults.html">accidentally removing security mitigations</a>.
Seemingly innocuous patches can make otherwise safe code
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/GNU_stack_quickstart">exploitable</a> in the context of
other vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The problem gets worse as we move towards niche architectures and targets that are used
primarily by small hobbyist communities.
Consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000_series">m68k</a>
(one of the other architectures affected by <code>pyca/cryptography</code>’s move to Rust): even
GCC <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc-patches/2019-10/msg02044.html">was considering</a> removing
support due to lack of maintenance, until hobbyists stepped in. That isn’t to say that any
<em>particular</em> niche target is full of bugs<sup id="fnref:although" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:although">10</a></sup>; only to say that it’s a greater likelihood
for niche targets <em>in general</em>. <strong>Nobody</strong> is regularly testing the mountain of userspace
code that implicitly forms an operating contract with arbitrary programs on these platforms.</p>

<p>Project maintainers don’t want to chase down compiler bugs on ISAs or systems that they never
intended to support in the first place, and aren’t receiving any active support feedback about.
They <em>especially</em> don’t want to have vulnerabilities associated
with their projects because of buggy toolchains <em>or</em> tooling inertia when working on security
improvements.</p>

<h3 id="some-more-finger-pointing">Some more finger-pointing</h3>

<p>As someone who <em>likes</em> C: this is all C’s fault. Really.</p>

<p>Beyond language-level unsafety (plenty of people have
<a href="https://fishinabarrel.github.io/">covered that already</a>), C is <em>organizationally</em> unsafe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no standard way to write tests for C.</p>

    <p>Functional and/or unit tests <em>alone</em> would go a long
way in assuring baseline correctness on weird architectures or platforms, but the cognitive
overhead of testing C <em>and</em> getting those tests running ensures that well-tested builds of C
programs will continue to be the exception, rather than the rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no standard way to build C programs.</p>

    <p><a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2019/04/23/Make-is-probably-fine">Make is fine</a>, but it’s not standard.
Disturbingly large swathes of critical open source infrastructure are compiled using a hodgepodge
of Make, autogenerated rules from autotools, and the maintainer’s boutique shell scripts. One
consequence of this is that C builds tend to be flexible <em>to a fault</em>: prospective packagers
can inject all sorts of behavior-modifying flags that may not be attested directly
in the compiled binary or other build products. The result: it’s almost impossible to prove that
two separate builds on different machines are the same, which means more maintainer pain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no standard way to distribute C programs.</p>

    <p>Yes, I know that package managers exist. Yes, I know how to statically link. Yes, I know how to
vendor libraries and distribute self-contained program “bundles”. None of these are or amount to
a <em>complete</em> standard, and each introduces additional logistical or security problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no such thing as truly cross-platform C.</p>

    <p>The C abstract machine, despite looking a lot like a PDP-11, leaks the underlying memory
and ordering semantics of the architecture being targeted. The result is that even seasoned
C programmers regularly rely on architecture-specific assumptions when writing ostensibly
cross-platform code: assumptions about the atomicity of reads and writes, operation ordering,
coherence and visibility in self-modifying code, the safety and performance of unaligned accesses,
and so forth. Each of these, apart from being a potential source of unsafety, are <strong>impossible
to detect</strong> statically in the general case: they are, after all, perfectly correct
(and frequently intended!) on the programmer’s host architecture.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By contemporary programming language standards, these are conspicuous gaps in functionality:
we’ve long since learned to bake testing, building, distribution, and sound abstract machine
semantics into the standard tooling for languages (and language design itself). But their absence
is <strong>doubly pernicious</strong>: they ensure that C remains a perpetually
unsafe development ecosystem, <em>and</em> an appealing target when bootstrapping a new platform.</p>

<h2 id="the-life-of-a-package-maintainer-is-hard">The life of a package maintainer is hard</h2>

<p>The project maintainer isn’t the only person hurting in the status quo.</p>

<p>Everything stated above <em>also</em> leads to a bum job for the lowly package maintainer<sup id="fnref:yt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yt">11</a></sup>. They’re
(probably) also an unpaid open source hobbyist, and they’re operating with constraints that
the upstream isn’t likely to immediately understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The need to link against versions of dependencies that have already been packaged (and perhaps patched)</li>
  <li>ABI and ISA subset constraints, stemming from a need to distribute binaries that function with
relatively old versions of <code>glibc</code> or x86-64 CPUs without modern extensions</li>
  <li>Limited visibility into each project’s test suite and how to run it, much less what to do when
it fails</li>
</ul>

<p>They <em>also</em> have to deal with users who are unsympathetic to those reports, and who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rarely submit reports to the packager (they bug the project directly instead!), or …</li></ul></div>

    <p>I’m supposed to be blogging instead of doing <a href="https://bengtan.com/blog/app-startup-vs-content-startup/">“app startup”</a> things but I got sidetracked and built another side project (again).</p>
<p>I’ve been getting into email newsletters. Over the last month, I’ve gone from zero newsletters to eleven of them. My inbox is now overflowing with newsletters. Maybe I’ll have to cut back but that’s a story for another time.</p>
<p>I have a new pet hate: Links in email newsletters.</p>
<p>They are user-hostile. Substack is the worst. Their URLs look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://email.substack.com/c/ejXDKM2OhCAMgJ9muI3hT3QOHPayr2EKVIesgwbquL794njbhEIhNP36eSCclnzYdSnEzm2gY0WbcC8zEmFmW8E8xGBlb1pljGTBdsJpLVksw5gRXxBnS3lDtm5ujh4oLulTIVvJnjbgCKC51hxawbuuxzCCcwHAo0CprrawhYjJo8U35mNJyGb7JFrLTX3d5Hdd-743CWjL2PjlVR8gU_qZLpoGLdre3LkUd87Vw9wrnZX1ymUN3XbtoxENjIYbFKBVq3wrxlF47oLolZNKonrcNC-bKwT-RzT4u1aKRBHmd8S99mTZOkwTQRL153TOfZKcYw_1fG0p0jFgAjdjuIzQJfbjaJgwYa7CwwBkhRGq75Xu-4fpLgVVmZKdFNUzqxxhqVXJ_uP4AyNKkNQ">http://email.substack.com/c/ejXDKM2OhCAMgJ9muI3hT3QOHPayr2EKVIesgwbquL794njbhEIhNP36eSCclnzYdSnEzm2gY0WbcC8zEmFmW8E8xGBlb1pljGTBdsJpLVksw5gRXxBnS3lDtm5ujh4oLulTIVvJnjbgCKC51hxawbuuxzCCcwHAo0CprrawhYjJo8U35mNJyGb7JFrLTX3d5Hdd-743CWjL2PjlVR8gU_qZLpoGLdre3LkUd87Vw9wrnZX1ymUN3XbtoxENjIYbFKBVq3wrxlF47oLolZNKonrcNC-bKwT-RzT4u1aKRBHmd8S99mTZOkwTQRL153TOfZKcYw_1fG0p0jFgAjdjuIzQJfbjaJgwYa7CwwBkhRGq75Xu-4fpLgVVmZKdFNUzqxxhqVXJ_uP4AyNKkNQ</a></p>
<p>What is that, Substack?! Is that really a URL with 400+ characters?!</p>
<p>I have an ingrained habit of hovering over links. This allows me to see where it links to and decide whether to click on it.</p>
<p>It’s a good habit.</p>
<p>It’s also a security “best practice”. Hovering over a link helps to check whether it’s a phishing link.</p>
<p>Email newsletters have broken this. I have no idea where these user-hostile links go. For their own self interest, mailing list service providers have denied me a basic tenet of the web: Knowing what I’m clicking on before I click.</p>
<p>It’s also demeans the newsletter. A newsletter which purports to send me a ‘list of interesting links’ is just sending me a list of crap because I’m not clicking on those I-have-no-idea-where-it’s-going links.</p>
<p>If the link was something like <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;url=https://www.wikipedia.org/&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ay7vaEtH0yTTYdDmrvinX">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;url=https://www.wikipedia.org/&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ay7vaEtH0yTTYdDmrvinX</a> I wouldn’t be as peeved because I can see where it links to.</p>
<p>But no, I don’t think they’ll compromise.</p>
<p>Not happy.</p>
<p>I set about trying to make the situation palatable. I asked <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26188976">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/ln4dep/smt_hover_over_links_in_email_newsletters_and_see/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/17a17962db">here</a> but I didn’t find anything satisfactory.</p>
<p>So I built my own solution.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>I hooked a script up to an email address. Upon receiving an email, the script will replace tracking links with their destination URL, remove tracking pixels, and send it back to the sender.</p>
<p>Then, I set up a gmail filter to forward my newsletters to the script.</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Now, when I receive an email newsletter, gmail forwards it to the script. The script sends it back to me with nice clean URLs. Once again, I can see where links lead to before I decide whether to click.</p>
<p>Tracking parameters (ie. <code>utm_*</code>) and tracking pixels are removed as well. (I don’t care strongly about this but it was easy to add so I did.)</p>
<h2 id="email-cleaner">Email Cleaner</h2>
<p>For lack of a better name, I’m calling it <strong>Email Cleaner</strong>. <strong>It cleans crap from email newsletters</strong>.</p>
<p>(Alternatively, I considered calling it ‘<strong>UntrackMe: Remove tracking from email newsletters</strong>’. Which sounds better?)</p>
<p>I’m letting others try it. Maybe other people find it useful too. If there’s enough interest, I’ll turn it into a proper side project.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>To try Email Cleaner, forward an email newsletter to <code>email-cleaner@bengtan.com</code>.</p>
<p>In a minute or two, you should get the newsletter sent back to you (from <code>no-reply@bengtan.com</code>) with cleaned links and tracking pixels removed.</p>
<p>If you decide you like it, you can set up your email program to automatically forward email newsletters to <code>email-cleaner@bengtan.com</code>.</p>
<p>How you do this depends on your email program so you’ll have to work it out youself.</p>
<p>Note: Please don’t set up your email program to automatically delete after forwarding. Since this is a new service, it’s a good idea to retain the original emails in case something goes wrong.</p>
<h3 id="forwarding-loops">Forwarding loops</h3>
<p>If your automatic forwarding configuration mistakenly forwards the cleaned email (from Email Cleaner) back to Email Cleaner, it will detect this and send you an email with the message “Infinite loop detected”. If you get such an email, please adjust your forwarding configuration so you don’t forward cleaned emails to Email Cleaner.</p>
<p>If you use gmail (like I do), this can be accomplished by adding the condition <code>-subject:[email-cleaner]</code> to your forwarding filter.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Email Cleaner works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>It scans the email for links which match the following regular expressions:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js">	<span>'\.list-manage\.com/track/click'</span>,
	<span>'//click\.convertkit-mail\.com/'</span>,
	<span>'//email\.substack.*/c/'</span>,
	<span>'//apple\.co/'</span>,
	<span>'//t\.co/'</span>,
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>If a link matches, then it’s a tracking link. Email Cleaner crawls the link to see if it’s a 3xx redirect. If it is, then the link is replaced by the destination URL.
<ul>
<li>Any URL query parameters which are <code>mc_cid</code>, <code>mc_eid</code>, or start with <code>utm_</code> are also removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, Email Cleaner scans the email for tracking pixels. If any are found, it removes them.</li>
<li>Finally, the email is sent back to the sender.</li>
</ul>
<p>Email Cleaner is quite safe and conservative. It will only crawl links which are obviously tracking links.</p>
<p>Email Cleaner currently handles three major mailing list service providers (MailChimp, ConvertKit, Substack). I’d happily add more. Just let me know.</p>
<p>Note that Email Cleaner doesn’t magically bypass the tracking links. Instead, it triggers all of them from a data centre somewhere. It’s privacy-by-obfuscation instead of privacy-by-abstention. But it does prevent your web browser/IP address/location from being leaked.</p>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Email newsletters are more user friendly. (I’m more inclined to click on a link if I see it’s a reputable website.)</li>
<li>Helps detect phishing attacks.</li>
<li>Better user privacy.</li>
<li>Plain text emails are readable again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plain-text-emails">Plain text emails</h2>
<p>The last benefit was an unexpected side effect.</p>
<p>Whilst writing Email Cleaner, I discovered that plain text versions of email newsletters are completely unreadable.</p>
<p>They look something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most agree that the term Artificial Intelligence was codified at a Dartmouth workshop in 1956 [httр://email.substack.com/c/eJxdkc-OgyAQh5-m3Grkr3rgsJd9DQM4WlIFA2O7vv1O2-xlE2CSHzPhy0dwCEsup91zRfY6Rjx3sAmegAiF7BsUE71mvZJcKUa87qgTgpG4mVAAXjYuGssOZN3dEkeLMafPBpOMzFp1wluppHM9Z2FoQQQbnAqd8tx2A7_P2t1HSCNoeEM5cwKy6Blx3R7868F-qkFqjviMK_hom1ym2rrqmr5twVfecTZHLs9tziuJmrWMtqy6kJ0cGtrYoFoF1Aou-ShpCHRsnac9d4wz4MNDtNvuNrTjkzbwu1YNCaNd3hGOZsykaAdpQptonZyur2v3dT1tan7tKeJpIFm3gL954I31Q8hMkKBU3N5Y1FRR3vdc9P2guhtABcZZx2ilTKoOn-tW0v90_AEVdJLl].

</blockquote>
<p>Is that supposed to be readable?! (It’s not just Substack. The other providers are almost just as bad.)</p>
<p>Email Cleaner changes it to:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>which is moderately readable.</p>
<p>It would be even better if it was:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>[0] httрs://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop<br>
[1] httрs://computerhistory.org/blog/thinking-about-machines-and-thinking/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but that’s a story for another time. (I don’t know if it’s worth the effort to do this. Do many people still read emails in plain text?)</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>Please note that Email Cleaner is only a proof of concept. It’s an experiment. I wouldn’t even call it an MVP.</p>
<p>It’s useful to me, but I don’t know if it’s useful for others. I’d like to find out.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long Email Cleaner will last since:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s vulnerable to spam (There’s no authentication or access control), and</li>
<li>It’s not scalable (It’s running on a tiny server).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the spam bots arrive, or too many people use it, it’ll probably have to stop.</p>
<p>Or if there’s sufficient interest, I’ll rewrite it into a proper side project.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>Please don’t forward any personal or private emails to Email Cleaner. Only forward publicly available email newsletters (Paid newsletters are okay).</p>
<p>All received emails go to Email Cleaner’s inbox. I hope to accumulate more test data with which to conduct further research on mailing list service providers and improve Email Cleaner.</p>
<p>There’s not really a privacy policy. This is an experiment.</p>
<p>If you forward emails to Email Cleaner, I consider that as your opt-in.</p>
<p>Anything you forward to Email Cleaner could be used to improve Email Cleaner.</p>
<p>OTOH, I don’t know anything about you anyway. All I have is an email address and what email newsletters you subscribe to (whatever can be inferred from that).</p>
<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>Since this is a new and experimental service, please don’t expect it to be perfectly reliable nor correct. If you forward an email to Email Cleaner and don’t get a reply in a few minutes, maybe something broke. Please get in touch with me and I’d be happy to look into it.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, suggestions, criticisms, etc. — please also let me know. I’d be happy to talk.</p>
<p>I hope you like Email Cleaner! Thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div>  <p><span>27 Feb 2021</span></p><p>I came across <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan</a> on Hacker News, and I was initially confused, due to a few memories of cross-compilation nightmares: while it should be possible to compile for the same architecture regardless of operating system, wouldn’t the OS get confused by the leading bytes of the executable? I read the <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">article</a> explaining how it works, but most of it went over my head.</p> <p>The example on the <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Github README</a> used the following script for compilation:</p> <div><div><pre><code>gcc <span>-g</span> <span>-O</span> <span>-static</span> <span>-nostdlib</span> <span>-nostdinc</span> <span>-fno-pie</span> <span>-no-pie</span> <span>-mno-red-zone</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>-o</span> hello.com.dbg hello.c <span>-fuse-ld</span><span>=</span>bfd <span>-Wl</span>,-T,ape.lds <span>\</span>
  <span>-include</span> cosmopolitan.h crt.o ape.o cosmopolitan.a
objcopy <span>-S</span> <span>-O</span> binary hello.com.dbg hello.com
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I converted it into a simple Makefile to run the compilation commands. I tried a bunch of simple C programs (basic arithmetic, reading and writing to files) on Linux+Windows (compiled on Linux), and all of them worked.</p> <h2 id="compiling-lua-with-cosmopolitan">Compiling Lua with Cosmopolitan</h2> <p>I decided to try compiling a high-level language built on C. I originally picked Python, but the Makefile for Python seemed too complicated to mess with, so I then picked <a href="https://www.lua.org/download.html">Lua</a>, which looked much simpler in comparison.</p> <p>I started out by blindly copy-pasting the flags and includes used in the sample compilation on Github. Ah, it would have been wonderful for my laziness if it compiled out of the box. Following is a play-by-play commentary of trying to compile Lua.</p> <p>First problem I ran into was header clashes: if I didn’t put <code>-nostdlib -nostdinc</code> while compiling each object file, <code>-include cosmopolitan.h</code> would clash with the system headers. But blocking the system headers meant I would have to change every <code>#include</code> of a system header. I created a bunch of dummy headers with the same names as those in the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/header">C stdlib</a> and and included to those instead.</p> <p>Naming clashes: some of the macros in <code>cosmopolitan.h</code> clashed with macro/function names in Lua: <code>reverse</code> and <code>isempty</code>. I changed the Lua source to avoid this.</p> <p>A macro <code>FIRST_RESERVED</code> was broken because <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> was missing. I thought <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> was supposed to be in <code>limits.h</code> – the <code>limits.h</code> part of <code>cosmopolitan.h</code> did not have <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> (It had <code>SCHAR_MAX</code>, though.) I added in a <code>#define</code> stating <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> as <code>__UINT8_MAX__</code> (ie 255).</p> <p>The default Lua Makefile attempts to use <code>_setjmp</code>/<code>_longjmp</code> in <code>ldo.c</code> when on Linux. I disabled the <code>LUA_USE_LINUX</code> flag for compiling the object files, but this caused an issue with <code>tmpnam</code> in <code>loslib.c</code> (<code>mkstemp</code> is available in Cosmopolitan). I changed the Lua source to use <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code>. A similar issue showed in <code>lauxlib.c</code> for <code>sys/wait.h</code> (which is a no-op in non-POSIX systems, as per the Lua source code), and in <code>liolib</code> for <code>sys/types.h</code> so disabled <code>LUA_USE_POSIX</code> over there as well.</p> <p>The <code>localeconv()</code> function (part of <code>locale.h</code>) was not implemented in <code>cosmopolitan.h</code>, and this caused an error while compiling <code>lobject.c</code> (macro <code>lua_getlocaledecpoint()</code> depended on <code>localeconv()</code>). Changed the macro to just return <code>'.'</code>.</p> <p>The <code>panic</code> function in Lua <code>static int panic (lua_state*)</code> clashed with that in Cosmopolitan <code>void panic(void)</code>. Renamed the lua function to <code>lua_panic</code>. This triggered an error where the <code>panic</code> function was being called in <code>luaL_newstate</code>, so I changed the name there as well.</p> <p><code>luaL_loadfilex</code> caused a <em>frame size error</em> – I have never seen this before. A quick internet search shows that this is because a large buffer is allocated on stack when entering the function, and yes, <code>luaL_loadfilex</code> allocates a <code>loadF</code> object containing a <code>char</code> buffer of <code>BUFSIZ</code>. I reduced the size of the buffer to <code>BUFSIZ - 64</code>.</p> <p><code>loslib.c</code> reuiqres the <code>setlocale()</code> and <code>LC_*</code> from <code>locale.h</code>, which is defined as an extern value in <code>cosmopolitan.h</code>, but that definition is somehow not enough.. screw it, I just disabled <code>os_setlocale</code> in <code>loslib.c</code>, and then it compiles.</p> <h2 id="linking-the-object-files">Linking the object files</h2> <p>Ok, time for linking …</p> <div><div><pre><code>gcc -std=gnu99 -o lua   lua.o liblua.a -lm -Wl,-E -ldl
/usr/bin/ld: errno: TLS definition in //lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 section
.tbss mismatches non-TLS reference in liblua.a(lauxlib.o)
/usr/bin/ld: //lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: error adding symbols: bad value
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I forgot, I shouldn’t <code>-lm</code> or <code>-ldl</code>. Ok, let’s try with all the object files instead of <code>liblua.a</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code>/usr/bin/ld.bfd: lvm.o: in function `l_strcmp':
lvm.c:(.text+0x59): undefined reference to `strcoll'
/usr/bin/ld.bfd: lmathlib.o: in function `math_tanh':
lmathlib.c:(.text+0x21f): undefined reference to `tanh'
/usr/bin/ld.bfd: lmathlib.o: in function `math_sinh':
lmathlib.c:(.text+0x24f): undefined reference to `sinh'
/usr/bin/ld.bfd: lmathlib.o: in function `math_cosh':
lmathlib.c:(.text+0x27f): undefined reference to `cosh'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Umm… okay, it looks like some of the functions defined in the cosmopolitan header are yet to be implemented in the static library. That’s okay, I can just quickly fill in the math functions, and I’ll comment out <code>strcoll</code> for now, just because I want to see it compile…. and it successfully compiles!! Let’s run <code>objcopy</code> before trying it out on a system though.</p> <div><div><pre><code>$ objcopy -S -O binary lua lua.exe
$ ls -al
-rwxr-xr-x 1 1953720 Feb 27 01:33 lua
-rwxr-xr-x 1 344064 Feb 27 01:39 lua.exe
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That size reduction seems a little too drastic, but let’s see if it runs on Linux:</p> <p><img src="https://ahgamut.github.io/assets/images/linux_screen.png" alt=""></p> <p>Awesome. How about Windows?</p> <p><img src="https://ahgamut.github.io/assets/images/windows_screen.png" alt=""></p> <h2 id="summary-it-is-actually-portable">Summary: it <em>is</em> actually portable</h2> <p>This is pretty incredible: I just had to modify a few lines in a Makefile and some C source files, and I got a Lua executable that works both on Linux and Windows (and possibly others as well). Granted, there are still some details to be filled out (floating point calculation above prints a <code>g</code>), but Cosmopolitan is currently at release 0.0.2, so there is a lot of time.</p> <p>Hopefully this means that other languages that have source code completely in C can also be compiled once and run anywhere. Actually Portable Python next, maybe?</p> </div> </div></div>]]>

      <h2 id="pre-introduction">Pre-introduction</h2>
<p>Recently I stumbled upon and then stumbled upon again on <a href="https://blog.dave.tf/post/new-kubernetes/">David Anderson</a>’s interesting post about “new Kubernetes”, based on a discussion he had with <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery Lancey</a> about what they would do differently if they were rewriting Kubernetes from scratch. Interestingly, a decent part of the proposals for a “new Kubernetes” are design choices made by Hashicorp for <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a>, which is a pretty underrated orchestrator, and drastically simpler ( one of the main goals of said “new Kubernetes”).</p>
<p>Some people are aware that Docker Swarm kinda exists but is abandonware/on life support, and isn’t really recommended anymore, but it still comes up in discussions due to how easy it is to use. For most, that leaves Kubernetes as the only “serious” option, but it is a <em>very</em> complex piece of software, with a lot of moving parts, which isn’t actually required or need in most cases.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://atodorov.me/img/nomad/kubernetes.jpg#center">
    
  </figure>


<p>This inspired me to write a series on Nomad, what it is, why it’s great, where it’s lacking and how to use it.</p>
<h2 id="introduction---what-is-nomad-and-why-its-great">Introduction - what is Nomad and why it’s great</h2>
<p>Hashicorp’s Nomad is a simple to run and maintain, yet very flexible task scheduler/orchestrator. It relies on plugins for execution, autoscaling and other features, and can run pretty much anything via its <code>task drivers</code> - Docker, contairnerd, LXC, rkt, podman, Java, fork/exec, QEMU, firecracker, FreeBSD jails.</p>
<p>It comes in the form of a single binary, run in two modes (<code>server</code>, in groups of 3 or 5, which make scheduling decisions and host the APIs and configuration, and an unlimited number of <code>worker</code>s which actually run whatever it is you want to run), and can be automatically clustered via <a href="https://consul.io/">Consul</a>. The configuration ( both for jobs and of Nomad itself) is in <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl">HCL</a> (I’ll get into more detail about how great that is a bit later) or JSON (mainly for when the jobs are submitted by machines/scripts/tooling and not humans). Multiple clusters can be connected via <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/federation?in=nomad/manage-clusters">multi-region federation</a> for sharing ACLs and for API forwarding ( you can submit a job or request logs to any server for any region and it will be forwarded to the appropriate server). Deployments can be complex out of the box ( rolling, canary, blue/green), and everything is version controlled and rollbackable.</p>
<p>Like most HashiCorp tools, it’s “open core”, meaning that the majority of features are available in an <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad">open source</a> version, and some more advanced/enterprise-y ones ( in Nomad’s case, <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-nomad-multi-cluster-deployment">multi-region/cluster deployments</a> - deploying something simultaneously to multiple separate clusters, policy as code with <a href="https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/nomad">Sentinel</a> and similar ) require upgrading to Nomad Enterprise.</p>
<h2 id="primitives">Primitives</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>job</code> is a declarative file which contains groups of tasks, each task being a container/binary/anything run by an exec driver</li>
<li><code>system</code> jobs (run on all client nodes, equivalent to Kubernetes DaemonSets, for monitoring/logging agents/load balancers)</li>
<li><code>periodic</code> jobs (equivalent to cronjobs)</li>
<li><code>service</code>, which registers as a Consul service and is thus discoverable ( via API or DNS)</li>
<li><code>deployment</code>, each version of a job, they’re tracked and can be rollbacked to</li>
<li><code>allocation</code>, each instance of a task ( group ) on a node</li>
<li><code>namespace</code>, a logical unit to organise jobs in and ACLs around</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jobs">Jobs</h3>
<p>Example of a very basic job that runs a Docker container (<code>jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.21</code>), with limits of 1000Mhz of CPU and 1024MB of RAM, and registers the service with Consul:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>job</span> <span>"jaeger"</span> {
        type <span>=</span> <span>"service"</span>
        <span>group</span> <span>"api"</span> {
            <span>task</span> <span>"jaeger"</span> {
                driver <span>=</span> <span>"docker"</span>
                <span>config</span> { 
                  image <span>=</span> <span>"jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.21"</span>
                }
                <span>resources</span> {
                  cpu <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>
                  memory <span>=</span> <span>1024</span>
                }
                <span>service</span> {
                  name <span>=</span> <span>"jaeger-query"</span>
                }
            }
        }            
}
</code></pre></div><p>Note that this is a <em>very</em> basic job, there are no healthchecks, no persistent storage, no extra configuration, no update strategy, no autoscaling, no exposed ports.</p>
<h4 id="deployment-history-and-rollback">Deployment history and rollback</h4>
<p>Nomad tracks each job’s full definitions and deployment history, and allows you to easily rollback and compare them, via the UI, CLI or API, e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># List the versions of the job named "opentelemetry-collector"</span>
$ nomad job history opentelemetry-collector

<span># Revert job "opentelemetry-collector" to version 0</span>
$ nomad job revert opentelemetry-collector <span>0</span>

</code></pre></div><h4 id="state-tracking-and-job-planning">State tracking and job planning</h4>
<p>Nomad keeps the desired state and its history, and with <code>nomad job plan</code>, similar to <code>terraform plan</code>, allows us to preview what will change upon applying a new job file. There’s also a feature to verify nothing has changed between the <code>plan</code> and <code>run</code> (equivalent to <code>terraform apply</code> with a plan file) with the <code>-check-index</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ nomad job plan otel.nomad
+/- Job: <span>"otel"</span>
+/- Task Group: <span>"opentelemetry"</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> create/destroy update<span>)</span>

          ports<span>[</span>1<span>]</span>: <span>"jaeger_thrift_compact"</span>
        <span>}</span>
Scheduler dry-run:
- All tasks successfully allocated.

Job Modify Index: <span>413</span>
To submit the job with version verification run:

nomad job run -check-index <span>413</span> otel.nomad

When running the job with the check-index flag, the job will only be run <span>if</span> the
job modify index given matches the server-side version. If the index has
changed, another user has modified the job and the plan<span>'</span>s results are
potentially invalid.
</code></pre></div><p>Overall, it’s a very useful feature, especially when collaborating, locally or via CI/CD.</p>
<h4 id="checking-the-status-and-logs">Checking the status and logs</h4>
<p>To check the status of a job, there are a few commands under <code>nomad job</code> and <code>nomad alloc</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ nomad job status otel

$ nomad alloc logs 89031cfd

</code></pre></div><h4 id="lifecycle-and-sidecars">lifecycle and sidecars</h4>
<p>Nomad allows defining the lifecycle of tasks in task groups, and their status, with the <code>lifecycle</code> stanza. We can have <code>prestart</code> ( for initialisation ), <code>poststart</code> ( companion, for proxying (aka ambassador and adapter pattern in Kubernetes )) or <code>poststop</code> for clean up, and via the <code>sidecar</code> bool we define whether or not it should run as long as the main task(s), e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">  <span>task</span> <span>"init"</span> {
    <span>lifecycle</span> {
      hook <span>=</span> <span>"prestart"</span>

<p>ACL ( access-control list ), or RBAC ( role-based access control ) as it’s known in Kubernetes, allow defining who can do what, so that not everyone with network access can have full administrator privileges and run/stop whatever. Nomad’s ACL system is pretty similar to Consul and Vault’s, and uses JSON ( mostly for non-humans ) or HCL to define <code>policies</code> with <code>rules</code>, which describe what action is allowed on what object.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span># a basic policy which allows the predefined read policy with read-only access to list and read:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) has released an AI overclocking tool on BIOS, which allows the PC users who are not experienced in overclocking to overclock the CPU and boost the operating system performance.</p>



<p>I am using a ROG Z390 MAXIMUS XI HERO (WI-FI) motherboard and an Intel i9-9900K CPU. In this blog post, I would like to share my experience with the ROG AI overclocking on Linux.</p>

<h3 id="benchmark-tools">Benchmark Tools</h3>

<p>Here are some benchmark tools that are available on Linux.</p>

<h4 id="blender">Blender</h4>

<p>Blender has a benchmark tool called <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Open Data</a>, which allows you to benchmark your CPU or GPU.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ wget https://opendata.blender.org/cdn/BlenderBenchmark2.0/launcher/benchmark-launcher-2.0.5-linux.tar.gz
$ tar xvf benchmark-launcher-2.0.5-linux.tar.gz 
$ ./benchmark-launcher 
</code></pre></div></div>

<!-- <div class = "titled-image">
<figure class = "titled-image">
    <img src = "https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2021-03-29-ROG-Linux-AI-Overclocking/blender.png" style = "width: 70%; height: 70%">
    <figcaption>Causal Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
</div> -->

<p>Blender is also a free and open source 3D creation suite. We could install it on Ubuntu using the following command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install blender
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="prime95">Prime95</h4>

<p>Prime95 is used for â€œburningâ€� your CPU. It is also available on Linux.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ wget http://www.mersenne.org/ftp_root/gimps/p95v303b6.linux64.tar.gz
$ tar xvf p95v303b6.linux64.tar.gz
$ ./mprime
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="openssl">OpenSSL</h4>

<p>OpenSSL comes with Linux by default. It can also be used for â€œburningâ€� your CPU.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ openssl speed -multi 16
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="turbostat">TurboStat</h4>

<p>TurboStat is a tool to monitor Intel CPU usages. We will mainly use it to monitor the CPU clock speed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install linux-tools-$(uname -r) linux-cloud-tools-$(uname -r)
$ sudo modprobe msr
$ sudo turbostat
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="rog-ai-overclocking">ROG AI Overclocking</h3>

<p>ROG AI overclocking could be done at BIOS level.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go into BIOS and set all the BIOS configurations to default, save and reboot.</li>
  <li>Go into OS and run one of the benchmark tools mentioned above, reboot.</li>
  <li>Go into BIOS and turn on AI overclock and XMP, save and reboot.</li>
</ol>

<div>
<figure>

    <figcaption>ROG BIOS AI Overclocking</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Before ROG AI overclocking, the stabilized CPU clock speed for all 8 cores of my i9-9900K during OpenSSL benchmarking was around 4.1-4.2 GHz. After ROG AI overclocking, it became 4.6-4.7 GHz.</p>



<p>For i9-9900KS, I believe it is possible to overclock all 8 cores to 5.0 GHz.</p>

<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/1iiifg"><code>lobste.rs</code></a>.</p><p>I should not have posted this to Hacker News on a Saturday night right before
going to bed, but in my defense, this post blew up in a way I didn’t expect.</p></div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>There was a recent <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771">dust-up on GitHub</a> surrounding the decision by the
<a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography">Cryptography library</a> (which I will call <code>cryptography</code> for convenience) to
switch to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>One of the distro maintainers of my distro of choice, <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>, filed a bug
report with the <code>crytography</code> saying that the switch broke builds on several
platforms that Gentoo still supports. The <code>cryptography</code> authors replied that
those platforms are not really used anymore, and that they were going to stick
with Rust because it has better memory safety than C. They also argued that it
is better to force better programming languages on people because of better
security.</p><p>At first glance, it appears that the better argument is on the side of the
<code>cryptography</code> maintainers, but after thinking about it carefully, I think they
are wrong.</p><h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2><p>There are a few reasons why I believe the <code>cryptography</code> maintainers are at
fault.</p><h3 id="due-diligence">Due Diligence</h3><p>First, their argument for Rust (and against C) because of memory safety implies
that they have not done due diligence in finding and fixing such bugs.</p><p>I can almost hear the rage of my readers against that paragraph above and
against the fact that I don’t have a commenting system on my blog. So let me
answer the comments preemptively.</p><p>“They are volunteers, giving their time away for free!”</p><p>Yes, but they also <em>intend</em> for their code to be used widely. They managed to
succeed in that, so they now have some obligation to their users.</p><p>“They don’t have any obligation!”</p><p>If a software project actively goes out and gets users, which just about any
project with a serious number of users has done, then yes, they have an
obligation to those users. The reason is that they sold users on the idea of
using their software. In other words, they were marketing their software, which
means making promises.</p><p>In fact, when people release <em>libraries</em> and try to get users for them, it’s
<em>because</em> they want them to be used by downstream programmers. A programmer
might write a program to scratch an itch and release it, but that reasoning
applies much less to libraries, in my opinion.</p><p>“Okay, but they didn’t get anything in return, so there’s still no obligation.”</p><p>In return, the users gave them <strong>relevance</strong>.</p><p>One of the most vocal (in favor of Rust) developers of <code>cryptography</code> works for
Red Hat Security Engineering (if I read his GitHub profile right). I don’t know
if his work on <code>cryptography</code> helped him get that job, but it might have.</p><p>Another of the most vocal developers has a computer security company. I would
bet money that his work on <code>cryptography</code> gives his company relevance.</p><p>So they did <em>not</em> get “nothing” from users. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>By the way, this position comes from my own experience pushing my <a href="https://git.yzena.com/gavin/bc"><code>bc</code></a>. I
managed to convince the FreeBSD project to <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/tree/main/contrib/bc">make it the default</a> in FreeBSD
13.</p><p>Once I did that, I shouldered, willingly, the need to keep FreeBSD happy. And
while I have made mistakes, I have done well so far.</p><p>And with my <code>bc</code>, <strong>I did my due diligence with memory safety</strong>. I fuzzed my
<code>bc</code> and eliminated all of the bugs. I even run the generated fuzzer test cases
through AddressSanitizer, and my entire test suite is run through Valgrind
<em>and</em> AddressSanitizer. I also add failing fuzzer cases to my test suite, which
means I run more and more test cases through both of those frightfully
effective tools.</p><p>For the record, those tools are only effective with effective test suites, which
I spent a lot of time building. But <em>building</em> such a test suite is part of due
diligence itself.</p><p>So it follows that if the developers have <em>not</em> done their due diligence, their
users should <strong>leave</strong>, either by forking the project or creating a new one.
The relevance they gave to the <code>cryptography</code> authors should disappear.</p><h3 id="battle-tested-c-code">Battle-Tested C Code</h3><p>In fact, I have done enough due diligence with my <code>bc</code> that I would consider it
a dereliction of duty to Rewrite It in Rust (RIIR).</p><p>Why would it be a dereliction of duty? Because rewriting it in Rust would cause
<em>more</em> bugs, not less. This is because of several reasons:</p><ol><li>I would need to <em>redesign</em> it to fit the language.</li><li>I would need to <em>reimplement</em> it, and new implementations always have bugs.</li><li>The C code is battle-tested, both by me (using fuzzing and other techniques)
and by users.</li></ol><p>That last point is the most crucial, especially in the case of <code>cryptography</code>.</p><p>If the developers of <code>cryptography</code> claim that they have, in fact, done their
due diligence with regards to memory safety in their C code, then they are
claiming that it’s battle-tested.</p><p>The saying that “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,” and in this case,
<em><strong>if</strong></em> the <code>cryptography</code> developers are claiming that they have done their
due diligence, they are throwing away a bird in the hand for a single one in the
bush.</p><div><p><strong>Edit (28 Feb 2021)</strong>: This part of the post seems to be misunderstood widely,
so I am going to attempt to clarify.</p><p>People are arguing that having safe C code requires a frozen, small codebase
with a thorough test suite. And then they debate my position based on the belief
that the codebase needs to evolve.</p><p>For the record, I agree with them that in order to have safe C code, the
codebase must be small and frozen.</p><p>What I am arguing is that <strong>crypto</strong> code <em>should</em> be small and frozen, with a
thorough test suite. I wrote about that <a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2019/11/finishing-software/">here</a>.</p></div><p>And if that’s the case, their users should <strong>leave</strong> and take <code>cryptography</code>'s
relevance with them.</p><h3 id="desktops-and-smartphones-are-not-the-only-computers">Desktops and Smartphones Are Not the Only Computers</h3><p>The users of <code>cryptography</code> were claiming in the bug report discussion that Rust
is not portable to many platforms, and the authors said that they don’t have the
time or resources to target those platforms. Fair enough.</p><p>But then they claim that the <em>users</em> should put in the effort to port Rust to
their platforms. This is wrong.</p><p>The <code>cryptography</code> authors also claim that the platforms that Rust doesn’t
support do not matter. As we will see below, this is false.</p><p>While I agree that the <code>cryptography</code> authors are not responsible for porting
Rust to other platforms, the users of those platforms are not either.</p><p>That responsibility falls on the Rust developers.</p><p><em>They</em> were the ones who sold Rust to those who have used it, so as above,
<em>they</em> have the responsibility for supporting their users.</p><p>Granted, the Rust developers have made no claim about being portable to every
platform. But they <em>have</em> claimed that it is <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded">appropriate for embedded
software</a>.</p><p>If it were true, this would be great. After all, <a href="https://youtu.be/3HxPzutkNYw?t=257">IoT devices outnumber
desktops and smartphones by at least one order of magnitude</a>.</p><p>But there are a lot of them that LLVM, Rust’s backend, cannot generate code
for. In fact, there are a lot of them that <em>C++</em> cannot run on.</p><div><p><strong>Edit (28 Feb 2021)</strong>: Also, the Rust developers are the developers with the
most experience reading ISA manuals knowing how to make a compiler generate
code. So they are still the best placed to support those “esoteric”
architectures.</p><p>And if they do not know how to read ISA manuals and generate code, it’s because
they lean too heavily on LLVM.</p></div><p>Make no mistake; embedded software is still running the majority of devices in
the world. And C is the king of embedded software.</p><p>I don’t know exact numbers, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the majority of
programmable devices in the world cannot run Rust.</p><p>Thus, because Rust uses LLVM, it is not portable.</p><p>And in my opinion, Rust is not appropriate for the embedded space.</p><p>So in this case, I would consider that the <code>cryptography</code> developers were
victims of the Rust developers.</p><h3 id="gcc-is-not-the-only-compiler"><code>gcc</code> Is Not the Only Compiler</h3><p>That isn’t the only problem.</p><p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">project to make <code>gcc</code> able to compile Rust</a>. That’s commendable.</p><p>However, many people seem to believe that once it’s done, Rust will be portable.
That is not the case.</p><p>Why? Simple: <strong><code>gcc</code> is not the only compiler</strong>.</p><p>There is plenty of code out there that uses dead simple C compilers, like
<a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">tcc</a>, <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">sdcc</a>, and others. And often, they have <a href="https://embeddedgurus.com/stack-overflow/2012/06/optimizing-for-the-cpu-compiler/">good reason to do
so</a>.</p><p>Adding a <code>gcc</code> frontend, while it will improve the situation, will not make Rust
as portable as C. Period.</p><h3 id="pushing-for-progress-hinders-it">Pushing for Progress Hinders It</h3><p>The other thing that the <code>cryptography</code> authors claim is that their users who
refuse to adopt Rust are hindering progress.</p><p>That may be true, but it is also true that forcing “progress” on others hinders
<em>true</em> progress.</p><p>By forcing users to either adopt Rust or pin their dependency on <code>cryptography</code>
to the most recent version without it, they are forcing those users to use
stagnant code.</p><p>Isn’t that the very opposite of progress?</p><h2 id="cryptography-at-fault"><code>cryptography</code> at Fault</h2><p>Those reasons lay out why I think the <code>cryptography</code> authors should shoulder the
blame for this situation, and I think I can explain where they went wrong.</p><ol><li>They let ideology come before pragmatic engineering.</li><li>They sold <code>cryptography</code> to users.</li><li>They knew that switching to Rust would break existing users and did it
anyway.</li><li>They either did not do their due diligence for memory safety, or they did
and threw that battle-tested code out.</li></ol><h2 id="portability">Portability</h2><p>To be honest, I used to think that it was better to switch to a better language
than C.</p><p>I had several talks with Linux distro maintainers, as well as a talk with my
father-in-law, that convinced me that C’s portability is still important enough
that it should be used.</p><p>Unless, of course, you <em>explicitly</em> target only certain platforms. But you had
better be prepared to never target others.</p><p>In fact, after talking with the distro maintainers, who have had to build Rust,
I am also convinced that it’s not just about being portable, it’s also about how
<em>easy</em> it is to <em>build</em> software.</p><p>Rust’s bootstrap is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">complicated</a>, and it is one of the worst things about
it.</p><p>If building software in Rust means building Rust for a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">Tier 3</a> platform,
you can bet that <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/02/09/Rust-move-fast-and-break-things.html">people will stick with C</a>.</p><h3 id="zig">Zig</h3><p>I want to take a moment to talk about Zig.</p><p>Zig might be one of the most promising up-and-coming languages of recent memory.</p><p>But it will ultimately fail to reach its goal.</p><p>You see, Zig is meant to replace C.

<p>It begins in October 1927, with a single camera exhibited in Moscow at an Exposition of Photographic Technique in the new Soviet capital, Moscow. Bostelman’s camera is a small 35mm camera with a simple, single-speed shutter and a winding key to advance the film. The camera’s back is removable, and removing it turns the rest of the camera into an enlarger which can be used to make prints.<span data-ez-name="kosmofoto_com-box-3"></span></p>
<p>It never makes it into production, but Bostelman’s simple snap-shooter is the first Soviet camera. What comes after this is first a trickle, and then a flood.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, and the Soviet camera industry is the second-largest in the world – second only to Japan, whose bands such as Nikon, Canon, Minolta Olympus and Pentax have become household names. The Soviet Union has its own heavyweights, and between them they have churned out dozens and then hundreds of different camera designs as the decades tick by.</p>
<p>Thanks to a mix of espionage, war reparations, ingenious design and a desire to show the West a thing or two, the USSR’s camera makers come up with a Soviet answer to almost every camera type made in the West, though not necessarily at the same time. Soviet designers devised a myriad of different models, some of the brutishly simple, others showing real flair and ingenuity.</p>
<p>Odd, then, that the entirety of a photographic industry spread across the largest country ever formed and spanning more than 60 years can get judged off first impressions. In the last 20 years, I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve seen people declaim the quality of all Soviet cameras based off a single flea-market <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2018/12/zenit-e-russian-camera-review/">Zenit-E</a> which might have mouldering in someone’s basement for the last 30 years.<span data-ez-name="kosmofoto_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>
<p>This is something I’ve learned having spent the last 20 years collecting and using Soviet cameras. The first one I came across was a Soviet-era <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2017/06/lomo-lc-a-cameras-lc-wide-lca-120/">Lomo LC-A</a> compact in a camera shop in London’s West End; a solid black rectangle with surprising heft and exotic Cyrillic lettering. That Lomo sparked an enduring love for film cameras of all shapes and sizes, and a particular interest in those made behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, where I grew up, Soviet cameras were almost unknown. But that wasn’t the case in Western Europe. The boom years of the Soviet photographic industry during the Cold War coincided with a new age of prosperity and consumerism west of Berlin. More people had the money and time to travel, and they wanted cameras with which to document it. The Soviet Union wanted hard currency and had a smorgasbord of cameras that could be sold at subsidised prices. Along with the Praktica cameras of East Germany’s vast Pentacon, Soviet cameras appealed to a huge swathe of photographers with a limited budget.</p>

<p><span data-ez-name="kosmofoto_com-box-4"></span>This article – and it’s a big one, so get a drink handy – is an attempt to dispel some of the myths that have developed around Soviet cameras, especially since the 1990s. It’s not trying to pretend that it’s only politics got in the way of the USSR’s cameras, and that every Zenit and Zorki is a match for a Nikon or a Leica. Some of the horror stories you might have heard about Soviet camera quality are 100% true. But not every Soviet camera is a lemon, and some are capable of taking fantastic images if you take the trouble to learn their strengths and, yes, their weaknesses.</p>

<h4><span id="The_big_five"></span><strong>The big five</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>But first, a little history.</p>
<p>The Soviet camera industry was dominated by five big names: <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/KMZ"><strong>KMZ</strong></a> (<em>Krasnogorskiy Mechanicheskiy Zavod</em>) in Moscow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOMO"><strong>Lomo</strong></a> in St Petersburg, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_(brand)"><strong>Kiev-Arsenal</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FED_(camera)"><strong>FED</strong></a> in Ukraine and <a href="https://vintagecameralab.com/brand/mmz/"><strong>MMZ</strong></a> (the home of BelOMO) in what is now Belarus. Some of these bureaus concentrated on one particular style of camera – FED, for instance, became known for Leica-copy rangefinders they started making in the 1930s and they were kept in production until almost the end of the Soviet Union itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/Z8Z2KH28" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://az743702.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/kofi2.png?v=0" alt="Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com" height="36"></a> <em>Found this guide useful?

<p>The cameras created ranged from rudimentary compacts simple enough for children to ambitious designs intended to compete with the very best the West had to offer. The latter were a kind of photographic soft power – with no internal market to pay top dollar for them, the higher-spec cameras were touted as evidence of Soviet ingenuity and engineering prowess</p>
<figure id="attachment_22492" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22492"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kosmofoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/zenite4-e1590396414210.jpg" alt="Zenit-e (Pic: Stephen Dowling)" width="2000" height="1500"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22492">The Zenit-E is the most-produced 35mm SLR in history (Pic: Stephen Dowling)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much simpler cameras were made in Soviet industrial quantities: million after million. This model became the dominant one from the mid 1970s. Camera designers were no longer urged to make cameras to compete with the best of the West, but to tweak tried-and-trusted designs a little each time. You can see this in the successive designs that came after the ubiquitous Zenit-E SLR and Lomo’s simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smena_(camera)">Smena viewfinder camera</a>. Despite cosmetic changes on the outside, underneath little changed from camera to camera.</p>
<p>A leading Soviet camera collector named Viktor Suglob recently produced a Russian-language book called ‘<a href="http://ussrphoto.com/Wiki/default.asp?WikiCatID=39&amp;ParentID=4&amp;ContentID=311&amp;Item=1200+Cameras+from+USSR+by+Suglob%2C+Shaternik%2C+Kochergin">1200 Soviet Cameras</a>’, an encyclopaedia of almost every prototype and production camera devised over nearly 75 years of the USSR. Many of these, of course, were never produced beyond a few samples or pre-production models. But hundreds of designs did make it into production. Today, millions of these cameras – from KMZ and Lomo, MMZ and FED – still survive in working condition.</p>
<h4><span id="The_major_models"></span><strong>The major models</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>If you’re curious about Soviet cameras, you’ll find the easily available cameras falling into seven main groups:<span data-ez-name="kosmofoto_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leica copy rangefinders:</strong> Mostly made by FED in Kharkiv in the Ukraine and under the “Zorki” name from KMZ in Moscow. These cameras use the same <a href="https://camerapedia.fandom.com/wiki/39mm_screw_lenses">L39 screw mount</a> that Leica rangefinders did up until the mid-1950s. These cameras were produced, in various forms, until the early 1990s.</li>
<li><strong>Contax-style rangefinders:</strong> The Kiev brand started out copying the Contax II rangefinder produced in Germany before the war, initially with Contax parts taken as war reparations. The “<a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Kiev_rangefinder">Kiev Contax</a>” line of cameras was made until the late 1980s</li>
<li><strong>Zenit SLRs:</strong> KMZ produced the Soviet Union’s widest array of SLR cameras under the Zenit name. The earliest versions were little more than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorki_1">Zorki rangefinder</a> with a reflex prism attached, but the line grew more popular in the late 1960s with the Zenit-E, the first Soviet SLR to use the M42-screw mount. M42 Zenits were made until the early 2000s, and a narrower range of cameras from the mid-1980s until the mid-2000s used the Pentax K mount. Lomo, and Kiev also produced SLRs, but these are far less common.</li>
<li><strong>Simple viewfinder cameras:</strong> Both Lomo in St Petersburg and MMZ in Minsk produced very similar families of snapshooters, rectangular viewfinder cameras with a simple shutter and a three-element glass lens. MMZ’s were called <a href="https://camerapedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vilia">Vilia</a> and Lomo’s were known as Smenas. Just two Smenas – the <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2020/03/these-are-the-most-produced-35mm-cameras-of-all-time/">Smena-8 and the 8M</a> – were built to the tune of around 21 million, making them the most-produced 35mm cameras of all time. These cameras are cheap and rudimentary, but their glass lens definitely elevate them out of toy camera territory.</li>
<li><strong>Simple TLRs:</strong> Medium format cameras were not produced in the same breadth and scale as 35mm cameras, but there were still some successful models. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubitel">Lubitel family</a> of cheap 120-format TLRs are the easiest to find. Built out of plastic but with glass Triplet-style lenses, these Lomo-made cameras were produced from the 1940s until after the fall of the Soviet Union.</li>
<li><strong>Medium format SLRs:</strong> The Soviet Union’s equivalent to the <a href="https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2019/04/camera-geekery-pentax-67/">Pentax 67</a> was the <a href="https://vintagecameradigest.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/the-kiev-6c-a-photographic-artifact-of-the-cold-war/">Kiev-6C</a>, which eventually evolved into the <a href="http://mattsclassiccameras.com/slr/kiev-60/">Kiev-60</a>. These are big, heavy SLR cameras with a rougher finish than their Western counterparts but with a range of very well-regarded lenses.</li>
<li><strong>Hasselblad-style medium-format cameras: </strong>The Kiev factory also produced a series of Hasselblad-style focal plane cameras, the Kiev-80 and <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Kiev_88">88</a> being the best-known of them. The lenses made for the Kiev-6/60 were also produced for some versions of this camera range. They are cheap – especially compared to Hasselblads – but they don’t come with a great reputation for reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were many other brands and minor camera ranges made in the USSR (the plucky Lomo LC-A compact spawned a movement in photography all on its own), but these are the main ones. They are all reasonably easy to find – very easy in the case of Zenit SLRS and FED rangefinders – and there’s no shortage of spare parts or repairers that can coax them back to life should anything be wrong.</p>
<p>Kosmo Foto released the video below last year as a guide for common models to investigate:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGlfbl5Oa_k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4><span id="Better_dead_than_Red"></span><strong>Better dead than Red?</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>Make no mistake – many film camera shooters regard Soviet cameras as uniformally awful, junk that should live in a landfill rather than a camera cabinet. Most of these photographers would sooner cut off a limb than handle a clunky Zenit or Zorki.</p>
<p>But the Soviet camera industry had peaks and troughs – periods when construction and quality control were high and times when standards were lax and reliability low. A Soviet rangefinder from the mid-1950s is from a very different system to one produced in the “Year of Stagnation” of the late 1970s.</p>

<p>The bad reputation which Soviet cameras isn’t undeserved,” says Jay Javier, the Filipino photographer and camera collector behind the <a href="https://www.fedka.com/jay/">Fed Zorki Survival Site</a>. “Many were really badly designed or made. As these creatures become more known, thanks to the internet, the bad ones get to be publicly shamed and justly avoided. Many of the generalisations in this respect turn out to be valid.”</p>
<p>Soviet quality control, especially in later years, sometimes left a lot to be desired. Cameras leaving the factory were supposed to be inspected and given a passport signed by a factory foreman ensuring they were working correctly. This The older …</p></div></div>

								Welcome back to Fightin’ Words! It’s been a while since we last discussed how the <a href="https://ki.infil.net/w01-bugs.html">most famous fighting game bugs</a> have impacted the community’s favorite games. Today’s topic is a bit more technical, but it’s an equally important factor in how our favorite modern games are played -- we’re going to be doing a <strong>deep dive into netcode</strong>.								
								</p>
								</div>

								<hr><!-- Infil -->

								At its core, netcode is simply a method for two or more computers, each trying to play the same game, to talk to each other over the internet. While local play always ensures that all player inputs arrive and are processed at the same time, <strong>networks are constantly unstable</strong> in ways the game cannot control or predict. Information sent to your opponent may be delayed, arrive out of order, or become lost entirely depending on dozens of factors, including the physical distance to your opponent, if you’re on a WiFi connection, and whether your roommate is watching Netflix.
								</p><p>
								Online play in games is nothing new, but fighting games have their own set of unique challenges. They tend to involve direct connections to other players, unlike many other popular game genres, and <strong>low, consistent latency</strong> is extremely important because muscle memory and reactions are at the core of virtually every fighting game. As a result, two prominent strategies have emerged for playing fighting games online: <strong>delay-based netcode</strong> and <strong>rollback netcode</strong>. 
								</p></div>
								</div>

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_thoughtful.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
								There’s been a renewed passion in the fighting game community that <strong>rollback is the best choice</strong>, and fighting game developers who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW61xJNJ9m8">choose to use delay-based netcode</a> are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTUtnclr2hs">preventing the growth of the genre</a>. While people have been passionate about this topic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2kAdmUCaI&amp;t=42m34s">for many years</a>, frustrations continue to rise as new, otherwise excellent games repeatedly have bad online experiences.
								</p><p>

								There are relatively few easy-to-follow explanations for what exactly rollback netcode is, how it works, and why it is so good at hiding the effects of bad connections (though <a href="http://mauve.mizuumi.net/2012/07/05/understanding-fighting-game-networking.html">there are some</a>). Because I feel this topic is extremely important for the future health of the fighting game community, I want to help squash some misconceptions about netcode and explain both netcode strategies thoroughly so everyone can be informed as they discuss. If you stick around to the end, I’ll even <strong>interview some industry experts and community leaders</strong> on the topic!
								</p><p>
								Before we dig into the details, though, let’s get one thing straight.

										Both companies and players should care about good netcode because <strong>playing online is no longer the future -- it's the present</strong>. 
								</p><p>
										While most other video game genres have been this way for a decade or longer, fighting game developers seem to be resistant to embracing online play, perhaps because of the genre’s roots in offline settings such as arcades and tournaments. Playing offline is great, and it will always have considerable value in fighting games, but it’s simply a reality that <strong>a large percentage of the player base will never play offline</strong>. For many fighting game fans, playing online <em>is</em> the game, and a bad online experience prevents them from getting better, playing or recommending the game to their friends, and ultimately causes them to <a href="https://youtu.be/iTUtnclr2hs?t=758">simply go do something else</a>.
								</p><p>
										Even if you think you have a good connection, or live in an area of the world with robust internet infrastructure, good netcode is still mandatory. Plus, lost or delayed information happens regularly even on the best networks, and poor netcode can <a href="https://twitter.com/john_takeuchi/status/1162562266027327488">actively hamper matches</a> no matter how smooth the conditions may be. Good netcode also has the benefit of connecting regions across greater distances, effectively uniting the global player base as much as possible.

								<div><p>
										What about those who never play online because they much prefer playing offline with their friends? The <strong>healthy ecosystem</strong> that good netcode creates around a game benefits everyone. There will be more active players, more chances to consume content for your favorite game -- from tech videos to spectating online tournaments to expanding the strategy of lesser-used characters -- and more excitement surrounding your game in the FGC. Despite <a href="http://ki.infil.net/">Killer Instinct</a>’s pedigree as an excellent game, there’s no doubt that its superb rollback netcode has played a huge part in the sustained growth of its community.
								</p><p>

										Good netcode matters, period. So let’s talk about it.
