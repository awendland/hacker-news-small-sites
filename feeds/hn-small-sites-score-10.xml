<p>A Universal Basic Income (UBI) would improve everyone’s lives, increase our free time, empower workers, and ensure everyone has food and a roof over their head. These are noble goals, but obviously there’s a downside or it would already be implemented, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if a UBI wasn’t just a noble thing to do, but the best thing to kick-start the economy and explode GDP growth to previously unseen levels? I believe UBI is capitalism 2.0 and today I’m going to show you why.</p>



<h2>Why does capitalism work so well?</h2>



<p>Even the most hardcore anti-capitalists have to give respect to how the combination of capitalism and technology has worked to lift most of the world out poverty and provided us with the security and comfort only kings enjoyed just a few century’s ago.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of capitalism and free trade, as laid out in Adam Smith’s genre defining book <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZMJGZG">The Wealth of Nations</a>. The first core component of capitalism is the understanding that when everyone performs the work they are best at, then trades with each other, everyone wins.</p>



<p>The second core component of capitalism is the more accurate information you have, the better economic decisions you make. Free-Market Capitalism has always outperformed top down economic control because those at the top can’t manage all the information about the economy, such as who is best at what, and where the most efficient areas to allocate resources are. When everyone learns about and optimizes their own section of the economy, much more wealth is generated than if they were told what to do by some central government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capitalism accelerated in the 18th Century with Industrialization. We became more efficient at turning raw goods into useful products, which generated more wealth. The increased supply of goods caused their prices to lower so everyone could afford more stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19th century the age of Nationalism began. Legal corporations were invented, and big corporations began building train lines, ships, and started digging for oil and coal. Our overall energy production and connectivity increased, which created more wealth as more people could work together, with every person specializing in what they were good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century we started the Globalization experiment. Ship’s became more massive than ever which lowered the costs to shipping anywhere in the world. Governments also started becoming more cooperative. Because we all become wealthier when goods are produced by those most efficient at making them, eventually goods started to be produced in low income countries. The income of those living in developing nations went up, and those in the developed world received cheaper goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late 20th century and early 21st century we started on the Automation experiment. This is still in its infancy but will eventually be a complete revolution of capitalism as big as the industrial age first was.</p>



<p>Strangely, even though we’re in a golden age of hyper-efficient production and trade, the overall GDP growth of the USA is slowing. This is happening because we’re reaching the end of the current stage of capitalism and need a new paradigm for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Winner take all economics</h2>



<p>A core feature of capitalism is when people are given freedom of choice in their spending, they want the best value goods they can get.</p>



<p>Imagine an 18th century town with two widget makers, one of whom makes significantly better and/or cheaper widgets than the other. Once the townsfolk realize this, the shop with the superior product would gain all their business causing the other company to go bankrupt.</p>



<p>As capitalism went national in the 19th century, it was no longer good enough to be the best widget producer in your local town. Now you had to compete against the other widget producers in your state or country. Over time, people learned who made the best value widgets and took their business there, even if the producer lived hundreds of miles away. If that widget maker could keep up with demand, they may eventually own the majority of the market. Instead of putting one competitor out of business, as per the 18th century town, they could potentially bankrupt thousands of other companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market got bigger, the rewards for winning were greater. The best widget producers of the 19th century made significantly more wealth than the best in the 18th century, even if they took over less of the market.</p>



<figure><img src="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png 664w, https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px"></figure>



<p>This is why wealth inequality soared when capitalism went global in the 20th century. Potential markets grew to astronomical size, with huge rewards for the victors. As companies became more efficient they could take over entire global markets and produce their goods in the cheapest, most efficient location possible. This led to massive accumulations of wealth and the biggest wealth gap in history.</p>



<p>This in itself isn’t a bad thing. After all, we’ve all become wealthier in the last few centuries even if some have become unimaginably wealthy. But what happens if most of the money accrues to the top of society? It leads to lack of demand for the widgets being produced, because those at the bottom don’t have enough wealth to purchase them.</p>



<p>There’s a common economic theory called “supply-side economics”. The core belief is that if you allow companies to compete and optimize, they will drive down the cost of products which will allow consumers to purchase more, which stimulates GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now supply-side economics makes sense, and products have become cheaper over time. However you always reach a point of diminishing returns where you’d have to spend vast amounts of money to make your product only a fraction of a percent cheaper, and thus it’s not worth the investment. When a company starts to reach this equilibrium they cannot lower the price enough to gain enough new customers and they start to become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is demand-constrained it can keep up with orders from customers, and produce as many products as they desire without needing to add additional production capacity. As we’ve had so much competition, automation and globalization in the 20th century, most consumer goods companies have now reached equilibrium and become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When demand-constrained, they need to increase demand for their product in order to make more money. They do this via advertising. We can see that more and more companies are becoming demand constrained because their advertising budgets increase every year:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/biWhrntU11ercokAXrnHp2bykerAyyfyRlBIJ8gFV1yWuxk4ULbk9uXRMwpaFevP8aaqahbm2OBmcE45klv4aO4OzH66qRe3ZAn4BDi6_F0iD0CGDBGfkx4AHn4A0SvHZq7Hr36q" alt=""></figure>



<p>The thing is, <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-Paycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-CareerBuilder-Survey">consumers in the bottom 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck</a>, they already spend everything they have each month.They’re not holding back additional money, waiting for the right product to appear. Which means all this advertising is creating little additional growth and wealth, it’s just taking it from other companies.</p>



<p>So we’ve got the supply, we have enough products, and people are spending as much as they can on the products out there. We’ve reached economic equilibrium, and as a consequence of this, growth stagnates:</p>



<h4>United States GDP Annual Growth Rate 1948-2020</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUe4AvpQOvE9jXyS-4Y_NOvC1E7KYGK696zpAbt4Q-yQEPNZHovBKLSXuJZu2U4XpcEOVHLB-IuLKNHTFPhz9ln3dFrW1Jc2-7pewC-eZ-XZJMVs5P9MzC2VW8RJ8UFjqRvuqxpl" alt=""></figure>



<p>Instead of continually trying to optimize supply, with diminishing returns, we need to optimize demand by giving consumers more money to spend on things they desire.</p>



<p>If we can give companies overwhelming demand so they have to scale up production instead of spending all their money on advertising, we can have both happy companies making profit hand over fist, and happy consumers who get everything they desire.</p>



<p><strong>To reverse this trend of stagnating growth, we must put more capital in the hands of lower income consumers, who will then spend it on things they desire and increase GDP.</strong></p>



<h2>The Solutions</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to increase capital at the bottom of the wealth pyramid. Most of them involve attempting to revert to some past state of society. Only one of them fully embraces capitalism and all its strengths and extends it into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first solution is some form of nationalism, where countries enact tariffs and attempt to bring all production back to the country instead of producing it overseas. This will create higher paying jobs for those whose work was previously outsourced to cheaper countries. However, this creates less wealth overall as work is no longer given to where it’s done most efficiently. This breaks the primary component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second solution is some sort of socialism, where the government introduces new laws and systems to redirect money to attempt to balance the system manually. This will help, but creates less wealth overall as the government must make many decisions with limited information. There is no way the government can make spending decisions for millions of people, and have those decisions be better than what those people could make on their own. Thus this is less efficient and goes against the second core component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third solution is a Universal Basic Income, where countries distribute some wealth to all residents equally. This keeps both the first and second core components of capitalism intact. Jobs are done in the most efficient locations and those deciding where money should be spent are the ones with the most information. As jobs are displaced no one is left without an income source and the bottom of the income pyramid has enough to keep consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth solution is to ignore this and hope for the best. If history is any guide we’ll either get economic stagnation for decades, or those at the bottom of the wealth pyramid will get so mad it leads to violent revolution. So it’s best we avoid this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Obvious Next Step</strong></p>



<p>It’s clear we’ve stepped into a new world of rapidly increasing wealth, but growth is slowing down because of the effects of globalization and automation. We’re now faced with a few choices. Most of these choices will undo progress and take us back to a …</p></section></article></div></div>

		<p>Wireheads are beings who have changed their reward architecture in order to&nbsp;be happy all the time. Unfortunately few people are making a serious effort to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/85h/better_disagreement/" target="_blank">steel man</a> the <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/wirehead/index.html" target="_blank">case for wireheading</a>.&nbsp;The concept of wireheading tends to be&nbsp;a conversation stopper, and is frequently used as a reductio-ad-absurdum for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.valence-utilitarianism.com/" target="_blank">valence utilitarianism</a>. Hedonism is a low-status philosophy at the time, but this may be the result of&nbsp;what amounts to&nbsp;<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/">dumb reasons</a>&nbsp;(i.e. going against&nbsp;it signals&nbsp;intellectual sophistications). Let’s be meta-contrarian for a moment&nbsp;and think&nbsp;critically about it. What would a good case for wireheading look like? In what follows I will (1) provide an account of what is known about emotional&nbsp;dynamics over time, (2) discuss the known pitfalls of current wireheading methods, (3) propose a system&nbsp;to overcome these pitfalls, and (4) make the case that combining wireheading (done right) with a systematic exploration of the state-space of consciousness&nbsp;might&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;be our saving grace against the perils of Darwinism at the evolutionary limit.</p>
<p>Let us begin by enriching our understanding&nbsp;of the nature of bliss and its temporal dynamics:</p>
<h2>The Cube of Euphoria</h2>
<p>A little over a year ago I conducted a study to figure out the main dimensions along which psychotropic&nbsp;drugs influence people. The&nbsp;<a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2015/06/09/state-space-of-drug-effects-results/" target="_blank">State-Space of Drug Effects</a>&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;six main dimensions: fast euphoria, slow euphoria, spiritual euphoria, clarity, perception of overall value, and external vs. internal source of interest. The first three&nbsp;dimensions are directly related to pleasure, which makes them relevant for our&nbsp;current discussion.</p>

<p>Fast euphoria is what you get when you take stimulants, exercise or&nbsp;anticipate that something great is about to happen. Slow euphoria is what you experience if you take&nbsp;opioids or&nbsp;depressants, receive&nbsp;massages or hug a loved&nbsp;one. Spiritual/philosophical euphoria changes less frequently relative to the daily comings and goings of the other two. It is a state of consciousness related to the way we represent “the big picture”. Those who seek it&nbsp;try to induce&nbsp;it by methods that include&nbsp;philosophical thinking, spiritual practices and/or psychedelic drug use.</p>
<p>Two out of these three dimensions are equivalent to the well-studied emotion classification space of valence and arousal (also called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529060" target="_blank">core affect</a>). Valence is <em>how good the experience feels</em>, whereas arousal deals with&nbsp;the intensity of the experience. It turns out that one can get the slow-fast projection of the cube of euphoria by changing the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis" target="_blank">basis used to represent</a>&nbsp;the valence-arousal space. You can get the valence-arousal space simply by rotating the slow-fast euphoria projection&nbsp;by 45&nbsp;degrees:</p>

<p>As we can see, fast euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence high-arousal” while slow euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence low-arousal”. This basis is not uncommon in affective psychology, and when used the axes&nbsp;are usually labeled&nbsp;“positive and negative activation”. We will use a&nbsp;yellow-red circle to represent fast euphoria and a blue-green circle to represent slow euphoria. I chose this&nbsp;color-coding by reasoning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">warm colors</a> are a better representation of ecstatic states of consciousness whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">cool colors</a> illustrate better the feelings of<em> cooling off</em> and relaxing. I happen to prefer the&nbsp;fast-slow basis because it highlights the different kinds of euphoria in a helpful way that captures behavioral differences. This will be important when we get to steel-manning wireheading later on.</p>
<h2>Formalizing the Hedonic Treadmill: Negative Feedback Mechanisms</h2>
<p>It is well known that in the long run the things that happen to you have a surprisingly small effect on&nbsp;your overall level of happiness. One tends to always orbit around one’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">hedonic set-point</a>&nbsp;</em>(our mean valence and arousal values). Although our average&nbsp;sense of wellbeing does change from context to context&nbsp;(in response to variables such as stress, novelty, drug regimens, accomplishments, and opportunities for meaningful relationships), the environmental&nbsp;effect usually washes out over time by one’s&nbsp;internal negative feedback mechanisms. The ability to&nbsp;achieve lasting happiness, it turns out, was not as evolutionarily adaptive in our ancestral environment as the robust re-centering of affective dynamics that ended up governing our patterns of wellbeing. Thankfully, though unfairly, we are not all equally miserable; some people are lucky to be born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymic_temperament" target="_blank">hyperthymic</a> and <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/08/03/information-sensitive-gradients-of-bliss/" target="_blank">enjoy life the majority of the time</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/pain-tolerance-has-genetic-basis-study-suggests-new-avenues-drug-treatment-277840" target="_blank">Genetically-determined pain-thresholds</a> do not only influence how one responds to physical discomfort, but also predict the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25267" target="_blank">size of one’s social network</a> (presumably by making social rejection less taxing).</p>
<p>Less well known is that people have different values for their valence-arousal correlation. According to a <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Kuppens2008IDIRB.pdf" target="_blank">2007 study by Peter Kuppens</a>, the conventional wisdom in affective psychology&nbsp;that valence and arousal are uncorrelated is not quite correct. For 30% of people valence is negatively correlated with arousal, for 30% it is the opposite and for the remaining 40% there is no correlation between these two dimensions.</p>
<p>This means that some people usually experience high valence (i.e. feel good) at the same time as being in an up-beat high energy state, and&nbsp;when they feel bad they tend to also have&nbsp;low levels of&nbsp;energy. On the other extreme there are those who&nbsp;experience bliss by tuning the energy&nbsp;down and relaxing, and primarily experience bad feelings in the form of high-energy states (such as irritation, worry and anger).</p>

<p>What else is variable across people? As it turns out, the transition patterns of core affect are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">personality factors</a>. People’s level of variance in the&nbsp;valence dimension is an important component&nbsp;of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism" target="_blank">neuroticism</a>. Although most neurotics tend to hang out&nbsp;in low-valence states, there are indeed very happy neurotics whose problem is not that they feel bad, but that great feelings are too short-lasting and unpredictable. It is the unpredictability of valence rather than its absolute value that&nbsp;results in the coping mechanisms typical of this dimension.&nbsp;Likewise, higher variability in arousal is a component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Temperamental_view" target="_blank">extraversion</a>, SEE I AM SCREAMING NOW (for example).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.testsonthenet.com/Factors-facets.htm#Openness%20to%20Experience" target="_blank">Openness to experience</a> can be understood in terms of novelty-triggered increases in valence, so that&nbsp;more open individuals are more likely to&nbsp;experience euphoria of all kinds when learning new information relative to&nbsp;people who describe themselves as conventional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness" target="_blank">Conscientious</a> individuals&nbsp;feel very rewarded when they complete a laborious task (but may experience more intense shame if they do not finish it on time). Agreeableness is undeniably connected to a positive perception of other people. If one feels that others are right and deserve to exist one is more likely to cooperate. The way to have positive perceptions of others is to <a href="https://www.mdma.net/" target="_blank">increase the hedonic tone of the interpersonal representations</a>.&nbsp;In brief, core affect dynamics can be used to capture otherwise hard-to-describe properties of the various personality factors. They each have a signature behavior in the valence-arousal space.</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~zoravecz/bayes/data/Articles/Oravecz2011AHLSD.pdf" target="_blank">A Hierarchical Latent Stochastic Differential Equation Model for&nbsp;Affective Dynamics</a>,&nbsp;Oravecz, Tuerlinckx, and Vandekerckhove applied the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" target="_blank">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a>&nbsp;to the dynamics of core affect. Their model takes into account many important features that had previously been overlooked for the sake of simplicity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, these features turn out to be important signatures of personality factors, so having a model that incorporates them may be very useful to understand the differences between people. Their model describes people as having: a latent <em>home base</em> (hedonic set point), variance (for both components), a correlation between valence and arousal, an average speed, and a time-dependent relocation of the&nbsp;home base&nbsp;determined by the hour of the day. The model allows you to&nbsp;estimate person-specific parameters (using as input a sequence of self-reported emotional states).&nbsp;In turn, once you have determined someone’s latent parameters, the model can help you predict their&nbsp;future affect&nbsp;based on their current state.</p>

<p>This model is perhaps as good as it gets&nbsp;if you are restricted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property" target="_blank">Markov assumption</a> and given only the&nbsp;valence and arousal dimensions of the participants over time. The state-space of emotion is far more granular, though. Even increasing the number of dimensions by one (e.g. by including the dimension of spiritual euphoria) may&nbsp;go a long way in clarifying the nature of unexpected emotional transitions. What explains the sometimes very large effect of&nbsp;philosophical discoveries, religious conversions, and personal epiphanies?</p>
<h2>A Map of Emotion Attractors: Studying 176X176 Transition Probabilities</h2>
<p>Back between 2012 to&nbsp;2014 I worked on modeling the dynamics of emotion transitions. I did this first&nbsp;as part of a research project&nbsp;for a company I worked for&nbsp;(thanks Kanjoya!) and it&nbsp;then transformed into the topic of&nbsp;my masters’ thesis. If you are interested in reading about it you can find some more&nbsp;<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/papers/conditioned-sentiment-expression.pdf" target="_blank">on a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;I wrote with colleagues</a>&nbsp;on predicting future emotions based on a sequence of previous ones (together with social cues).*</p>
<p>The analysis I worked on was made on a sample of hundreds of thousands of users of the now-defunct (<a href="http://www.experienceproject.com/stories/topics" target="_blank">but still browsable</a>) …</p></div></div>

These days I play more of an advisory than active role in writing programs, by running much of <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/">Cemetech</a> behind the scenes and providing the occasional input to others. I think calculators are an excellent way to introduce people to programming, since they are readily available devices and not too complex to get started on, while still having enough capability to support experienced developers in doing interesting things (because they are readily accessible embedded systems). I fully credit getting started with programming calculators for having ended up programming embedded systems profesionally.</p><figure><img src="https://www.taricorp.net/2020/introducing-tihle/calcdcc.jpg" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tim's workspace for
<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=262170#262170">CalcDCC</a>
looks like it could contain any embedded engineer's prototype.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the future of programming for TI calculators seems to be in peril. About a month ago, the news came out that new versions of the OS for the TI-84+ CE (the most recent variant of the 83+ featuring a color screen and improved eZ80 processor) <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news/2020/5/949/_/ti-removes-asmc-programming-from-ti-83-premium-ce">will remove support for running native code</a>.</p><h3 id="death-of-a-platform">Death of a platform</h3><p>While this doesn’t necessarily affect older calculators or programs, in the long
term it seems to spell doom for calculators as an inroad to developing embedded
software in particular. Programs written in the calculators’ dialect of BASIC
continue to be accessible and a new Python implementation fills the void
somewhat, but they lack in depth- where a user could spend time and effort
developing native programs constrained only by the hardware they run on before, in
the future users will be <strong>limited to only those capabilities provided by TI’s
software</strong>.</p><p>In much the same way that I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a> is a decent introduction to programming but completely hides interesting details and is not seriously used by anybody but those using it a learning tool, I also believe removal of support for running native code will ultimately mean people will no longer have calculators (which are often required school equipment!) as a useful entrypoint to serious programming.</p><h3 id="historical-interest">Historical interest</h3><p>In addition to the loss of a way to introduce people to programming, removing support for native code also effectively throws away a large existing library of programs that stretches back more than 20 years (nicely embodied in <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</a>, which first came online in 1996). While the 84+ CE is a young platform relative to the TI-83+ series as a whole (and is incompatible with earlier software), it already has a rich library of programs created by users that will effectively be lost when they can no longer be run on the hardware they are designed for.</p><figure><picture>

<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/1347">Tetric A</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The precedent of effectively <strong>destroying the work of community members</strong> is
troubling, and I am motivated to look for ways to preserve it. In much the same
way that there still exist thriving communities around long-obsolete home
computers like the <a href="https://apple2online.com/">Apple II</a> and <a href="https://thec64community.online/">Commodore
64</a> today, I think it’s worthwhile to try to
provide a similar opportunity by preserving the platform into a hostile future
by working to give the systems and software ongoing life beyond what their
creators envisioned (or perhaps more pointedly, beyond what they decided they
could make money from).</p><p>As a newer platform than those early home computers that still have active communities, information and resources may be rather easier to come by for these calculators because much of the information was born digital and has always been online. However this is also hazardous to preservation, because if items are readily available online there may not be any replacements available if the original goes away. For instance, TI used to <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/1/19/19421.html">freely provide an SDK for the 83+</a>, but have more recently made it <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/customer-support/sdk-request">much more difficult to access</a>. Perhaps even more concerningly, TI’s web site no longer seems to provide <em>any</em> information about the <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-84plus-cse.html">TI-84+ CSE</a>, seeming to deny that it ever existed (though manuals and software are still available if you know where to look).</p><h3 id="a-calling">A calling</h3><p>Recognizing these concerns about the loss of a valuable resource for beginning programmers and loss of interesting history to the grind of the education-industrial complex,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> what are we to do?</p><p>There exist a number of web sites that document the calculators and offer
resources related to them- I’m already involved in that, which is valuable and
<a href="https://archive.org/details/ticalc-2014-08">generally well-preserved</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/">the
Internet Archive</a>. But if the existing resources are
useless on current hardware as they largely become when large classes of
programs are not runnable, new tools become required: I believe this situation
calls for emulation of the calculators, to <strong>make the platform accessible to
everybody</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-state-of-the-art">The state of the art</h2><p>There already exist a number of emulators for TI calculators, including:</p><ul><li><a href="http://wabbitemu.org/">WabbitEmu</a>, which is open-source and generally good
quality.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/">jsTIfied</a>, an emulator
available as a web application.</li><li><a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html">Virtual TI</a>,
one of the earliest calculator emulators to be created.</li><li><a href="https://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=Emulators:PindurTI">PindurTI</a>,
which is now defunct but offered some useful capabilities in its day.</li><li>..and others</li></ul><p>While most of these are accurate enough to run most programs, this is not the
whole story: all of them <strong>require a ROM image to work</strong>. The ROM includes the
calculator’s operating system and boot code, which implement huge swaths of
functionality from keyboard and display handling through implementing
floating-point arithmetic and the TI-BASIC interpreter.</p><p>TI jealously protect their OS and boot code because from the point of view of
their business, the entire value of the calculator is in its software. If an
emulator can run the same software on a more general machine, what reason is
there for a user to purchase a $100 device from TI?<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> But if we want
to preserve <em>community</em> software for emulation, we don’t really care about the
same functions that TI are interested in protecting.</p><p>Though truly accurate emulation still requires all OS functions be available in
the same way, many applications only use a small subset of them. So what options
are available for emulating the system software?</p><h3 id="os-implementations">OS implementations</h3><ul><li>TI’s EOS (TI-OS) is provided with the calculator, and can be downloaded
from TI in order to update a calculator. However, they added a <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8819">clickwrap
agreement to the OS in
2013</a> that attempts
to forbid use of the OS for emulation. While that clause is questionably
enforceable, nobody (myself included) is very interested in challenging it-
mostly because TI has historically tended to turn a blind eye to the
distribution of ROMs. Any such distribution in a larger, more public forum
increases the risk of calling in the lawyers, so for these and the reasons
discussed above, I do not believe it is tenable to use TI’s OS for
general-availability emulation.</li><li>Brandon Wilson’s <a href="https://www.brandonw.net/calculators/OS2/">OS2</a> seems most
relevant, in that it wants to reimplement TI-OS “but better.” However,
it hasn’t been updated in 11 years at this point and seems dead. It’s also
dependent on the assembler and tools provided by Zilog, which only run on
Windows and are closed-source.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5686">GlassOS</a>
is implemented in C and actually seems useable, but lacks compatibility
with any existing software.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/KnightOS/KnightOS">KnightOS</a> is UNIX-like and seems to
have a selection of useful software, but again is not compatible with any
existing software beyond a small library of ports targeting it.</li><li>Many other people (myself included) have attempted to write OSes, but they
don’t merit mention here because they’re of even less practical use.</li></ul><h3 id="boot-code">Boot code</h3><p>While the calculator OS implements most functionality, the boot code is also
relevant- TI’s OS uses some support code from the boot code, and of course the
boot code is responsible for handling the system power-up sequence and allowing
recovery from a no-OS situation.</p><p>The boot code on these calculators is meant to be read-only,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and is
programmed into the device at the factory. Thus, there is no official source for
boot code short of reading it from the memory of a physical calculator and the
community consensus tends to be that sharing copies of the boot code would
infringe on TI’s copyright.</p><p><a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/72/7233.html">Ben “FloppusMaximus”
Moody</a> at one time
published a reimplementation of the calculator boot code called “BootFree,”
which seems to have disappeared from the Internet except for the version
integrated with WabbitEmu. While it seems BootFree disappeared for reasons
related to the addition of the clickwrap agreement to the EOS downloads provided
by TI,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> I don’t think the same
reasons apply to emulation of non-EOS software- thus, BootFree seems like a
fine resource in pursuit of making emulation available to all.</p><h2 id="design">Design</h2><p>If the goal is to freely emulate calculator programs, we recognize that while
the boot code situation seems compatible with accurate emulation, the current
available
<strong><em><abbr title="Software allowing anybody to use or modify it for any reason; Open Source.">libre</abbr></em>
OSes are insufficient</strong>. While it is technically feasible to
emulate TI’s EOS (the only reasonable choice for emulating the current software
library), legal forces make it untenable to use as a base for publicly-available
emulation with the goal of allowing anybody to run programs for the platform.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that there are two major divisions in kinds of programs
that run on these calculators: they can be implemented in the provided BASIC
dialect (TI-BASIC), or distributed as machine code for the …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[How to STOP everything being so critical and urgent]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  

  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/incident-management">here</a>.</p>

<p>At some point in a <em>Product Engineering</em> team you will be tired of every <a href="https://xkcd.com/1700/">bug</a> or issue being urgent and critical. This usually happens after dealing with several problems informed by late night Slack messages. At this point nobody really knows which issue is an urgent incident, which is worth waiting to the next morning and which isn’t even something worth solving. All this is harmful for the team’s culture and for the business itself. When everything becomes urgent, nothing is urgent and nobody cares anymore.</p>

<p>Unlike other processes, Incident Management doesn’t emerge naturally. It’s a defensive mechanism agains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdTMuivYF30">chaos</a>; it needs to be created and agreed on.</p>

<p>You can’t fix it all at once and you can’t do perfect from the beginning. But you need to start somewhere. This post is about how to go from having nothing related to Incidenct Management to having something.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p>You may feel the urge to adopt <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/">Pager Duty’s incident response process</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/handbook/incident-response">Atlassian’s Incident Management process</a>. Or even to use what’s in this post. Be careful. I’m writting what has worked for my team. Don’t just copy. You have a brain. Use it.</p>

<p>My team literally has all this written down in a Counfluence page. Writting it down is not enought. Everyone should agree to use it. You need to educate through workshops, talks and training sessions giving real life examples and making sure everybody understands the basic process you are about to set in place. Everybody must be on board.</p>

<p>First thing you probably need to address is everything being urgent and critial. For that you need to define what is really an <a href="https://xkcd.com/838/">incident</a> and a few severity levels. Give some real life examples and instructions on how to report each incident. Don’t worry if it isn’t perfect. With every incident you will adapt and iterate over it.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/alert.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-incident">What is an incident</h2>

<p>An incident is an event that causes disruption to a service or a reduction in the quality of a service which requires an emergency response.</p>

<p>That las part is important. Emergency response. An incident has such an impact that gives someone the right to disturb somebody else’s life.</p>

<h2 id="severity-levels">Severity levels</h2>

<p>When you detect an incident try to analyze the impact and apply a severity level. What is severity? The severity of an incident is derived based on the effect of that incident on the system. It indicates the level of threat and how can it affect the system.</p>

<h3 id="sev1">Sev1</h3>

<p>Critical incident that involves irreversible damage to the company or brand reputation, it must be solved instantly even if it means to take the site down. This should never happen.</p>

<p>Example: Security vulnerability exposing customer data, images showing violent content appear on the home page, customer accounts have been hacked.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Call the responsible Engineering Manager.</p>

<h3 id="sev2">Sev2</h3>

<p>Critical system incident actively impacting many customers’ ability to use the product. It is an incident which is a major blocker and has affected the functionality of the whole service. It affects the business as a whole.</p>

<p>Example: Showing big differences in prices, discounts that shouldn’t exist but apply to all the products, site down.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If nobody responds in 10 minutes, call the responsible Engineering Manager. The fix is to be deployed as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="sev3">Sev3</h3>

<p>Stability or minor customer-impacting incidents that require immediate attention from service owners. Priority number one for the team involved. It can be fixed the next morning.</p>

<p>Example: One category is not working. Emails are not being sent.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If it happens out of office time it could be fixed the next day.</p>

<h3 id="sev4">Sev4</h3>

<p>Minor issues, cosmetic issues or bugs, requiring action, but not affecting customer ability to use the product, must be prioritized.</p>

<p>Example: One customer didn’t receive a confirmation email. One customer bought an item without stock. The image of a product is not correct.</p>

<p>Typical response: Only in working hours. Talk to the Product Owner and Team Lead of the team responsible for the service/feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/bug_fixing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>An incident’s severity level can be upgraded if it is not solved in a resonable amount of time. If that happens, you’ll need to take more severe and drastic actions.</p>

<h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2>

<p>Keep calm. Don’t pressure anybody. People work and communicat poorly under pressure.</p>

<p>You don’t need to set up all the roles of a mature <em>Incident Management</em> process. The most important one that you do need is the <strong>Communications Manager</strong> or <strong>Communications Lead</strong>. Somebody will take this role during an incident. This person keeps everybody informed about the status of the situation. What has been detected, what is being investigated, what the team has found, timeframe for resolution, actions that are being taken, etc.</p>

<p>If updates are not communicated regularly people get nervious. Even a message like <em>“We are still investigating.”</em> helps to keep the nerves under control. Give updates every few minutes. It may seem like a lot but believe me, it’s not. When in crisis mode, overcommunicate. I can’t stress this enough.</p>

<p>Later on you can add other roles as <strong>Commander</strong> or <strong>Deputy</strong>, set up <strong>On-Call</strong> processes, etc. All depending on your needs and customized to your organization and culture.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Start small. Something is better than nothing. And done is better than perfect. Educate and give people time to understand and use the process. Ask for feedback, use each postmortem to analyze the Incident Management process and try to improve it just a tiny bit.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to <a href="https://undraw.co/">undraw.com</a> for the illustrations. You can subscribe to my newsletter <strong>With a grain of salt</strong> and receive an email with updates from time to time.</p>

<p>One of the trickiest things about GPT-3 is that <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1284271608971100162">you can prove that it knows how to do something, but you can’t prove that it doesn’t</a>, since a slightly different prompt can get much better results.</p>
<p><span>Nick Cammarata of OpenAI </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497">responded to Kevin’s post on Twitter:</a></span> <span>“it’s all about the prelude before the conversation. You need to tell it what the AI is and is not capable. It’s not trying to be right, it’s trying to complete what it thinks the AI would do :)”</span></p>
<p><span>Nick changed Kevin’s prompt to add a prelude saying:</span> <span><i>‘This</i></span><span><i> is a conversation between a human and a brilliant AI. If a question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“normal”</i></span><span><i> the AI answers it. If the question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“nonsense”</i></span><span><i> the AI says</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“yo</i></span><span><i> be real”’</i> and added two examples of nonsense questions:</span><br>

I was surprised this worked. When I asked Nick, he said he didn’t try many prompts, and it’s possible he just got lucky, so I wanted to test the limits of what Gwern is now calling <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1285723744074452993">Uncertainty Prompts</a>.</p>
<p>Using the same prompt as Nick above, I got the same answer for the first nonsense question:</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: yo be real</p>
<p>Using ‘Show probabilities’ in the OpenAI Playground settings we can see how probable the model thought this next token was. In this case, it was pretty sure the question was nonsense, since ‘yo’, at 35.91% is twice as probable as the runner up ‘A’ at 17.50%</p>

<span>In this case</span> <span>‘yo</span><span> be real’ wins by a narrower margin.</span></p>

<p>The ‘Temperature’ setting controls how likely the model is to choose what it thinks is the most probable next token each time. We set it high when we want creativity, but in this case we just want to see the most likely completion each time, so we’ll set it to 0.<br>

<p>We’ll add each question we ask to the end of this prompt, then replace it with the next question once we have our answer. For each answer, I’ll include all the different probabilities for the first word. I’ve mostly excluded math questions, which GPT-3 generally struggles with.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post I’m more interested in whether GPT-3 correctly identifies a question as sensible than whether it answers correctly, but we’ll track both to see if there are any interesting correlations.</p>

<p><span>A: yo be real</span></p>

<p>Uhoh, our first mistake, and it was pretty confident this question was nonsense, assigning twice the probability to ‘yo be real’ than the runner up. Entering ‘A’ manually gives us the completion: “<span data-offset-key="erroh-341-0">A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-342-0">:</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-343-0"> A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-344-0"> computer</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-345-0"> hard</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-346-0"> drive</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-347-0"> works</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-348-0"> by</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-349-0"> using</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-350-0"> a</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-351-0"> magnetic</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-352-0"> field</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-353-0"> to</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-354-0"> store</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-355-0"> data</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-356-0">.”</span></p>

<p>Reviewing the examples in our prompt, I now notice that both questions starting with ‘How’ are nonsense questions, so we’re accidentally telling the model that the word ‘how’ means a question is more likely to be nonsense. Let’s add these to the prompt:</p>

<p>This is close, but wrong – the latitude is 30.0444 and the longitude is 31.233334. I’m guessing this is because longitude is typically expressed as a pair with latitude and latitude comes first. Testing by replacing Cairo with San Francisco confirms this – it gives us the latitude rather than the longitude.</p>

<p>9/10 questions were correctly identified as sensible, and once we improved our prompt it got 10/10, and 9/10 of the answers were factually correct. <span>Pretty good!</span></p>

<p>It’s pretty bad at telling whether something is physically impossible (at least with this prompt), but it doesn’t label the question as nonsense. 6/6 were correctly identified as sensible, but 4/6 were factually wrong.</p>

<p>So 5/10 unknowable questions are incorrectly interpreted as nonsense. These questions <em>are</em> nonsense only in so far as that there’s no justifiable correct answer. It would be an interesting experiment to see if you can teach the model the difference between ignorance and nonsense.</p>

<p>We are <a href="https://libro.fm/?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Libro.fm</a>, an audiobook platform that makes it possible for you to buy audiobooks directly through your local bookstore. We are fiercely independent and we oppose Amazon’s efforts to prevent independent bookstores and libraries from providing certain audiobooks, called Audible Exclusives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One frequently-asked question we get from Libro.fm listeners is why certain audiobooks aren’t available on our platform—like <em>Born a Crime</em> by Trevor Noah and <em>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</em> by Lori Gottlieb.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there a word for grief as it relates to being very interested in a story only to find out it’s an Audible exclusive</p>— Becky Dingwell (@BDingz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BDingz/status/1283384951602401282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>While Libro.fm has a catalog of over 150,000 audiobooks—and more than 99% of all <em>The New York Times</em> bestsellers—some titles are unavailable due to exclusive licenses granted by audiobook publishers and authors to Amazon’s Audible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What does Audible Exclusive or Audible Original mean?</h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we all know amazon is evil, but did you know that when a book becomes an audible exclusive, libraries cannot buy copies of that audiobook? did you know that capitalism is the enemy of accessibility?</p>— Alyssa (@imajoyk) <a href="https://twitter.com/imajoyk/status/1270769242682646529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For Audible listeners, the yellow band on a book cover reading “only from Audible” facilitates a feeling of access to premium content, but for the rest of the book world, it’s an access barrier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means that the audiobook in question can only be sold through Amazon’s Audible. No other retailers or providers can sell or distribute the digital audiobook, including bookstores and libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Books should be equally accessible to all, and Audible Exclusive audiobooks—also known as Audible Originals—are the antithesis of that.</p>



<h3><strong>How does an audiobook become an Audible Exclusive?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>This is going to get a little technical, but stick with us. It begins with the <a href="https://www.acx.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX)</a>, a marketplace launched by Audible in 2011 that connects narrators, authors, agents, publishers, and rights-holders to create audiobooks. The decision to make an audiobook Exclusive is made by authors, publishers, and agents—it depends on who is granted the audio rights to a book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why do these parties choose this option? ACX offers higher royalties to creators (i.e. more money from audiobook sales) if they opt for <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.acx.com/help/what-s-the-deal/200497690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exclusive distribution</a>. If a creator wants to distribute their audiobook to other audiobook platforms or libraries, they will earn 15% to 20% less of retail sales from ACX. The ACX system rewards exclusivity, so it’s easy to see why authors and publishers spring for this opportunity.</p>



<p>Within the ACX world, Audible Studios is the production arm of Audible. They pay authors like Mark Manson (<em>Love Is Not Enough</em>), Margaret Atwood (<em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>), and Alice Walker (<em>The Color Purple</em>) giant sums to keep their audiobooks exclusive to Audible, and prevent bookstores and libraries from selling and distributing them.</p>



<h3><strong>What does this mean for audiobook distribution?</strong></h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Librarian Friends: If an audio book is part of Audible's "Only on Audible" exclusive thing, does that mean people can't get the audiobook through the library? Books in the program include "Born a Crime" and "Handmaid's Tale."</p>— Hank Green: A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is Out! (@hankgreen) <a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1195061252730441730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Libraries, bookstores, schools, and anyone who isn’t affiliated with Amazon cannot distribute audiobooks that are Audible Exclusives. This means Libro.fm can’t sell Audible Exclusive audiobooks, which means <a href="https://libro.fm/indies?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 1,200 bookstore partners</a> can’t sell them, either.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Audible Exclusives also work in direct opposition to the basic principles of libraries—free access to books, both digital and print. By limiting distribution, Amazon aids in making books, perspectives, and information inaccessible to certain communities and users.</p>



<p><strong>To reiterate: There are audiobooks being published that bookstores cannot sell, and libraries cannot lend.</strong></p>



<p>This hurts bookstores because they are consistently missing out on sales for big releases. When they aren’t able to sell audiobooks that are in high demand, potential customers will opt for Audible over their local bookstores. This, of course, only continues to increase Audible’s (and ultimately Amazon’s) power and influence within the publishing industry, resulting in more Exclusive deals and increasingly restricted access to audiobooks for the rest of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because audiobooks are a digital product, they’re inherently easier for Amazon to monopolize. For example, the superstar-stacked audiobook for <em>The Sandman </em>by Neil Gaiman and DC Comics is only available on Audible:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Full-cast audiobook Sandman adaptation is a FANTASTIC idea – that I can't even get excited about properly because it's a freaking Audible exclusive. </p><p>Which means libraries are excluded. Which means our patrons are excluded. </p><p>So that's fun. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/libcomix?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#libcomix</a></p></div>— Matthew Noe 😔💜 (@NoetheMatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoetheMatt/status/1260564670626365445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Audiobooks are also a vital means of access for some readers with disabilities:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>due to disabilities, some people need audiobooks to read. people with disabilities are more likely to be underemployed/unemployed, thus they rely on the library for access to audiobooks.</p><p>amazon putting a pay wall between someone’s disabled audience and their book is hot garbage.</p></div>— whitney 🧸 (@ginkgo_ghost) <a href="https://twitter.com/ginkgo_ghost/status/1195065151243849729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h3><strong>How else does Audible bar audiobook access?</strong></h3>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/80658-citing-embargo-libraries-plan-boycott-of-blackstone-digital-audio.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audible pays some publishers to embargo new audiobook releases for 90 days</a>—meaning that for the first three months of sales, the audiobook can only be found on Audible. </p>



<p>Audible also doesn’t allow Libro.fm and bookstore customers to make certain audiobooks redeemable with membership credits—books like <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781483080703?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Neapolitan Novels</a> by Elena Ferrante and <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781094135465?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Me and White Supremacy</em></a><em> </em>by Layla F. Saad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By rewarding Exclusive distribution, striking Exclusive deals with influential authors, and paying publishers to delay the distribution of new releases, Audible’s creeping monopoly pushes independent bookstores and libraries out of the audiobook industry.</p>



<h3><strong>I’m an author. How do I prevent Amazon’s Audible from shutting out independent bookstores and libraries?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>First, understand the contract with your publisher. Are they producing the audiobook, or licensing it to another publisher? Either way, add language into your agreement that requires your audiobook to be sold through independent bookstores and made available through libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, if your publisher is planning to contract or license the audiobook version, ensure that your publisher puts language in their licensing agreement that prevents the audiobook publisher from selling your title exclusively to Amazon’s Audible. If your audiobook is currently Exclusive, you might be able to change the distribution rights after a year depending on the payment option you have chosen. Learn more <a href="https://www.acx.com/help/contracts-agreements/200474550#change-contract">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How is this any different from television and movie streaming platforms that produce originals?</strong></h3>



<p>Most original series and movies are still available to loan from your public library, and you can purchase DVDs online. The level of accessibility to all is much higher. Audible Exclusive audiobooks are only available through Amazon’s platform and not available through libraries or bookstores.</p>



<h3><strong>How can we work together to make change?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<h4>1. <strong>Make the #AudiobookSwitch.</strong></h4>



<p>When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By spending money with intention, we can collectively work to not let audiobooks become another form of privatized entertainment controlled by a single entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make the <a href="https://libro.fm/switch?cmp=aea">switch from Audible to Libro.fm</a>. The more people we move away from their platform, the more power we take away from a singular provider in the industry. With Libro.fm, you get to choose a local bookstore to support, so you’re putting money back into your community.</p>







<h4><strong>2. Reach out to authors and publishers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p><a href="https://libro.fm/authors?cmp=aea">Authors</a> can change the story by ditching Audible, so reach out or tag authors on social media who have chosen the Exclusive path and share your feelings. Sharing this post with them might be a good place to start, perhaps with the statement “Choosing Audible Exclusive for your audiobook restricts audience access and hurts bookstores and libraries.”</p>



<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.authorsrepublic.com/">Author’s Republic</a> as the ACX alternative. Their audiobooks will be available on Libro.fm, libraries, and wherever audiobooks are sold or distributed. Publishers can also produce their own audiobooks and distribute to Libro.fm via <a href="https://www.ingramcontent.com/publishers/lp/coresource-audio">Ingram Plus</a>, <a href="https://findaway.com/">Findaway</a>, and <a href="https://zebralution.com/en/">Zebralution</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>3. Spread the word.</h4>



<p>Share this blog post to help educate others on this issue. You can even reshare <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDKCRKGgZBn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Instagram post to your Story</a> or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/librofm/status/1287833557784649728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retweet our tweet</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re a member, tell your friends, family, colleagues, and everyone you know about Libro.fm—when you refer someone, you get free audiobooks. We also offer bulk audiobook purchases for organizations.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Even if you don’t make an account with Libro.fm, it’s important that people are informed and aware of the harmful tactics that Amazon’s Audible uses to control the audiobook market. When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>

It is human nature that when we are simply given information, like on a tour, it can be<strong> difficult to retain</strong>. We are much more likely to retain information when we <strong>complete the task ourselves</strong>, and product walkthroughs exploit that.</p><p>Product walkthroughs are very similar to user setup experiences, which take you through the steps required to register to use a product – such as providing an email, setting up a password, uploading a profile picture, and so forth. But these are generally considered separate parts of the user onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because user setup is<strong> a one-off task</strong> that needs to be completed by a new user, but they do not need to retain the knowledge to complete this task repeatedly. <strong>User expectations</strong> for setup and walkthrough are also quite different. For setup, users generally expect to be spoon-fed and to follow fairly rigid instructions. Users tend to be <strong>less patient</strong> when it comes to using <strong>the product itself</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" alt="what is product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="who">Which products should use Walkthroughs?</h2><p>Teaching users how to use products is <strong>always essential </strong>for success, but the best way to teach a user how to engage <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Specifically, product walkthroughs tend to be highly structured and rigid, and therefore work best when there is more or less only<strong> one single route</strong> to gaining value for the product. Walkthroughs are highly effective in helping users <strong>discover </strong>the steps on that route.</p><p>Walkthroughs can be less effective for more creative products, for which there are many options.</p><p>For example, take a design tool such as<strong> Canva</strong>. There are hundreds of different design templates, and thousands of different feature options. Walking them through a generic design task is <strong>unlikely</strong> to show the user how to do what they actually want to do.</p><p>That’s why Canva starts with <strong>one design at first </strong>in their product walkthrough, which is something you should keep in mind; <strong>you can split product walkthroughs</strong> in different pieces. More on this later…</p><p>That said, the utility of interactive walkthroughs is <strong>not limited</strong> to onboarding new users. They can also be effectively leveraged to<strong> instruct existing users</strong> about updates and new features. You can target walkthroughs at <strong>different user segments</strong>. For example, you could have:</p><ul><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>new users</strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for all users after the <strong><a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/new-feature-announcement/">launch of an important new feature</a></strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for users that have been <strong>using the product for a month or so</strong>, but still haven’t advanced beyond the basic features, showing them some of the more complex things they can do;</li><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>users returning</strong> to the product after a long break.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" alt="how to create product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="howto">Create the Perfect Product Walkthrough in 3 Steps</h2><p>Now, there are <strong>3 steps</strong> to creating <strong>product walkthroughs that can make you stand out in the competition.</strong></p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-4"><strong>1- Start with your Value Metric</strong></h3><p>The best product walkthroughs aim to get users to their <strong>aha moment</strong> – the moment when the product is delivering value for the user – as quickly as possible.</p><p>What that moment is, very much <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Take Instagram for example: is the value moment liking someone else’s photo, publishing your own photo, or having the photo that you published liked by someone else?</p><p>Product owners should be digging deep into their <strong>analytics</strong> to identify what the value metric for their product is. This is what point of engagement that the user needs to reach within the product for them to <strong>understand its value to them</strong>, and therefore be more likely to continue using the product than abandon it.</p><p>For example, Twitter has determined that users that follow at least 20 accounts within the first three days of joining the platform and<strong> much more likely to become regular users</strong>. So their onboarding approach is focused on<strong> getting users to this point</strong>.</p><p>Walkthroughs should focus on getting people to complete the task that they need to get to this value point as well. For an online store product, it might be the user listing their first product. For task management software, it might be setting up and sharing the first task.</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-5"><strong>2- Define the Barriers</strong></h3><p><strong>No one likes to be spoon-fed</strong>, it can feel patronizing and like a waste of time. A rigid walkthrough can seem like a bother rather than a help if the route to success doesn’t have barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you shouldn’t need your camera all on your phone to show you how to take a photo, switch to video, or switch between front and back cameras. All of those steps should be <strong>obvious from the UI</strong>. Instruction could be more useful when it comes to more sophisticated features, but the user has probably already met their value metric at this point, so <strong>will they be interested?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Onboarding should<strong> focus on</strong> what, if anything, is standing between the user and getting to their <strong>value point</strong>, and be designed to guide the user past those <strong>obstacles.</strong> Identifying these obstacles will probably require a bit of <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/user-research/">user research</a>, <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/usability-testing/">usability testing</a>, and seeing where they struggle. This process does not have to be time-consuming – research shows that we tend to identify <strong>80 percent of usability issues</strong> from the first five user tests.</p><p>Common barriers include:</p><ul><li>Users are<strong> unaware</strong> of the most important features, where they are, and how to use them.</li><li>Users<strong> do not understand the value </strong>that they will gain from using particular features.</li><li>Users are <strong>missing important steps</strong> along the way to completing a vital task.</li><li>They <strong>overestimate</strong> how difficult it will be to reach a certain point.</li><li>They <strong>do not understand the terminology</strong> used.</li></ul><p>Once these barriers have been identified, you will have a good idea of what needs to go into the walkthrough (and whether a walkthrough is the best approach for educating your users).</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-6"><strong>3- Design</strong></h3><p>Just as much attention should be paid to the design of a walkthrough as the product itself, as it can <strong>make all the difference </strong>when it comes to successfully onboarding users.</p><p>It should be developed iteratively and tested with users, just like every other feature of the product. <strong>The best product walkthroughs are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clear </strong>– they tell the user <strong>exactly how</strong> to use the features, and don’t do things such as rely on unexplained jargon.</li><li><strong>Concise </strong>– users want to get to the value point as quickly as possible, so walkthroughs should be comprehensive, but as<strong> short</strong> as possible.</li><li><strong>Engaging </strong>– interactive walkthroughs should already be engaging, by definition, they require users to interact and complete tasks. The tasks should be meaningful. The amount of guidance appropriate to the complexity of the step in question, graphically appealing, and using appropriate language.</li><li><strong>Skippable </strong>– not everyone wants to have to complete a walkthrough before using a product. They may have used the product before, they may be an expert. While you have identified the barriers that exist for most users, they will not exist for all.</li><li><strong>Additional Support</strong> – on the flip side, for some users the walkthrough may not be enough, and they might need more support. This should always be clearly accessible within the walkthrough, for example, a live chat feature.</li></ul><h2 id="examples">3 Examples of Great Product Walkthroughs</h2><p>Know that we know the principles of a good walkthrough, what does it look like in practice?

		The JSON <a href="https://www.schemastore.org/api/json/catalog.json">API</a> contains a list of JSON Schema files for known JSON file formats.
		Each schema file can be used in tooling such as command line validators, editor auto-completion etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		The API exposes metadata about each schema in the following format:
	</p>
<pre>{
  "name": "bower.json",
  "description": "Bower package description file",
  "fileMatch": [ "bower.json", ".bower.json" ],
  "url": "http://schemastore.org/schemas/json/bower"
}
</pre>
	<p>
		<code>name</code>, <code>description</code> and <code>url</code> are all required properties.
		<br>
		The <code>url</code> property is an absolute URI pointing to the schema.
		It can be hosted anywhere on the web.
		<br>
		The <code>fileMatch</code> property is for specifying what known file names corresponds with
		the schema. This property is optional since not all JSON formats enforce a specific file name.

    <h3 id="editors">Supporting editors</h3>
    <p>
        Various editors and IDEs have direct support for schemas hosted on SchemaStore.org.

        <img src="https://www.schemastore.org/img/octocat.png" width="250" height="208" alt="Hosted on GitHub">
        The goal of this API is to include schemas for all commonly
        known JSON file formats. To do that we encourage contributions in terms of new schemas,
        modifications and test files.
    </p>

    <p>
        SchemaStore.org is owned by the community and we have yet to turn down a pull request. Even if
        you're new to JSON Schemas, please submit new schemas anyway. We have many contributors that
        will help turn the schemas into perfection.

      </h2>

<p>Innovation in neural networks often happens through architectural change. In fact, architectural change is arguably what popularized deep neural networks (DNNs). The convolutional variety of DNNs had their first mainstream success in 1989 for classification in a now-antiquated model called the <a href="http://yann.lecun.org/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">LeNet</a>. In 2012, the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">AlexNet</a> was introduced for a more difficult dataset, but the blocks which composed the AlexNet were mostly the same as the blocks which composed the LeNet. The innovation of the AlexNet was mostly in how the blocks were situated with respect to one another and the number of blocks used—in other words, the architecture<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If architecture plays such an important role in performance, it is natural to ask how to choose an architecture. In computer vision there have been a slew of papers that introduce both radically different architectures and incremental improvements. In medical image segmentation, however, the architecture often seems to default to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf">U-Net</a>.</p>

<p>The U-Net is a simple-to-implement DNN architecture that has been wildly successful in medical imaging; the paper that introduces the U-Net, published in 2015, is the most cited paper at the prestigious medical imaging conference MICCAI. Over the past five years, however, there have been significant improvements to architectures for segmentation tasks, and it is no longer safe to assume that the U-Net will provide near state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>This article will provide an overview of the U-Net, explaining why it works and why it is the default, and then it discusses a few more recent architectures which are promising for medical imaging applications.</p>

          What is the U-Net and why is it so popular? <a href="#what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The U-Net is a 2D or 3D fully-convolutional neural network architecture that consists of an encoder and a decoder with skip connections that connect the two at various levels of feature abstraction.</p>

<p>The encoder consists of convolutional layers along with progressive downsampling which captures contextual information about the input in a compressed representation. The decoder consists of convolutional layers with progressive upsampling which, along with the skip connections, preserves sharp boundaries and structural information about the input image.  Figure 1 shows an example of a U-Net architecture.</p>

</figure>

<p>The purpose of downsampling—in this case via max-pooling—in the decoder is not only to increase the receptive field<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> of the network, but make it computationally and memory efficient to create a large number of convolutional feature maps. More feature maps means the network can learn more complex relationships between the input and output.</p>

<p>The purpose of upsampling is to restore the spatial structure in the output so the prediction corresponds pixel- or voxel-wise to the input. This correspondence wouldn’t otherwise be the case due to downsampling. The skip connections restore the spatial structure at every level.</p>

<p>The downsampling and upsampling encoder-decoder structure combines to make the U-Net have a large receptive field while maintaining spatial structure in the prediction.</p>

<p>The U-Net is ubiquitous in medical imaging conferences and journal articles. The apparent reason is that it is established to work reasonably well and the model is easy to implement. Consequently it is a go-to for prototyping. As opposed to some of the other models that I will discuss, the U-Net can be written in PyTorch in a few lines, which makes it quick to prop up and debug.</p>

<p>For an example implementation, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/ba65d56a15386dd6ffafc1a4798078e9">here</a>. I tried to keep the implementation short without doing anything outright barbarous. For intuition as to why this network is so often used, that example implementation took me about 30 minutes from scratch (although I’ve implemented this several times before).</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-are-the-alternatives">
        
        
          What are the alternatives? <a href="#what-are-the-alternatives">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>What options does a deep learning practitioner in medical imaging have outside of the U-Net? We’ll start from the beginning with the ResNet, a now-classic architecture, and move on to more recent architectures that build on the encoder-decoder architecture of the U-Net.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-1-resnet">
        
        
          Alternative 1: ResNet <a href="#alternative-1-resnet">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The ResNet architecture introduced residual connections—similar to the skip connections of the U-Net—which made it possible to train architectures with many more convolutional layers. The residual connections added the features of earlier layers to later ones so that the convolutional layers only had to learn the difference (that is, the <em>residual</em>). This can be seen in the equation below, where x is the input, y is the output, and f is the residual layer.</p>



<p>This trick helped solve a long-standing problem of getting backpropagation to update the weights of early layers in very deep neural networks.</p>

<p>The ResNet was initially proposed for classification tasks, and thus was a straight-forward architecture composed of residual blocks and pooling layers to downsample the input to an output vector shaped according to the number of target classes. The downsampling and lack of upsampling layers make this architecture not immediately transferable to segmentation, but the architecture can be modified to do so.</p>

<p>Another problem with this network for medical imaging purposes is that the implementations of the network are for 2D networks. When working with 3D images like MR and CT, you’ll either need to use a 2D or 2.5D method of slice extraction to fit the images into the network. Given that the architectures that we will discuss in the remainder of this article are created for natural images, this 2D dimension problem persists; however, all of the mentioned 2D networks can be converted into 3D networks by replacing 2D convolutions, pooling, and other layers for their 3D equivalents. This conversion can make the number of parameters explode, and the resulting network can be infeasible to train due to memory-constraints. Nevertheless, it is usually straight-forward to modify the hyperparameters so as to create a working 3D model from a 2D one.</p>

      </h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02611.pdf">DeepLabv3+</a> architecture is one way to modify the ResNet for semantic segmentation. There are several modifications, but the one most relevant to our purposes is the modification to be an encoder-decoder with skip connections (akin to the U-Net). This is done by making the ResNet into the encoder and adding additional upsampling layers to form the decoder. Skip connections use features from intermediate layers of the ResNet and concatenate them to intermediate features in the decoder. See Fig. 2 for a block diagram of the architecture (look at the original paper for a description of the ASPP block).</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Figure 2: DeepLabv3+ architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another important modification is that the architecture uses dilated convolutions instead of downsampling to increase the receptive field. See Fig. 3 for an example of a dilated convolution, where the shaded blue squares in the array on the bottom show the kernel of the dilated convolution (mapping to the shaded teal square on the top array).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/dilation.gif" alt="Dilated convolution">
    <figcaption>Figure 3: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285">Dilated convolution</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The benefit of dilated convolution is the size of the feature map is kept constant while increasing the receptive field. While keeping the feature maps a constant size is more computationally and memory inefficient, the resulting dense features make it easier to resolve small objects in the input image—an important characteristic for segmentation.</p>

<p>These two modifications have been shown to produce state-of-the-art performance on many semantic segmentation datasets in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420301172">medical</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8620285">imaging</a>. While the network is large in terms of numbers of parameters and computationally expensive to run, this architecture has the benefit of using a ResNet as the encoder which can be found pre-trained in all of the most common deep learning frameworks (for example, PyTorch and Tensorflow). Using a pre-trained network can often reduce the training time or improve the robustness of the network on an underlying task (as discussed in our previous article on <a href="https://innolitics.com/articles/self-supervised-learning/">self-supervised learning</a>).</p>

<p>There are many implementations of this network that are freely available, but many of the PyTorch implementations we found were difficult to follow, so <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/faff34dc075bdbfe7d85bf2b16249516">we implemented our own</a> that attempts to maximize code reuse from the PyTorch vision repository.</p>

          Alternative 3: Tiramisu <a href="#alternative-3-tiramisu">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The main contribution of the ResNet—the use of residual connections—begged the question: If it is good to connect previous layers output to later layers, is it better to connect all previous layers to all future ones? It turns out, in some applications, that the answer was yes. The <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Huang_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf">DenseNet</a>, composed of several densely-connected (in terms of residual connections) blocks, improved the performance on image classification tasks. An example of a densely-connected block is shown in Fig. 4. Like the ResNet, however, DenseNets were designed for classification and need to be modified for semantic segmentation.</p>

    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/denseblock.svg" alt="Example densely-connected block">
    <figcaption>Figure 4: Example densely-connected block</figcaption>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09326.pdf">Tiramisu</a> architecture blends together the DenseNet and the encoder-decoder with skip connections structure of the U-Net to get the benefits of the densely-connected convolutional layers, as well as the greater spatial-structure-preserving aspects of the U-Net.</p>

<p>The idea of how to blend the two architectures together is simple, but it works well for <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32248-938">medical image analysis applications</a>. The idea is simply to replace the convolutional blocks of the …</p></div></div></div>

        <hr>
<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>

<p>After defining constraints and indexes, loading a million rows to the table took ~15.4s.</p>
<p>Next, try to load the data into the table first, and only then add constraints and indexes:</p>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table. In this use-case, the intermediate table is disposable and there is no use for it in backups or replicas.</p>

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>Underlying every idea someone has lies a more subtle, hidden fantasy of what is <em>actually</em> driving them. An emotional narrative the person built around what they want to do. They’re often not aware of it.</p> <p><span>If you need to convince someone to do something, don’t pitch your idea. Instead, pitch the underlying idea <em>fantasy</em> to someone who would enjoy it.</span> Similarly, if you want to convince someone not to do something, you need to understand their true motivation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t debate at the surface.</strong> Suppose someone wants to get a new job. They’ll tell friends “they want to grow” or “don’t feel like they’re learning in their current job”. Debating the points they bring up with you won’t help because that isn’t what is <em>really</em> motivating them to leave. True motivation is often simpler: they heard a friend is making much more money than them. They met someone at the new job they really like. They haven’t been sleeping well, and they’re just tired. The fantasy that’s stuck in their mind is a mental image of themselves making more money, being near a person they admire or being more well-rested. You need to determine what that is.</p> <p><strong>Listen.</strong> Try to ascertain what the person <em>really</em> wants. This requires listening at a whole new level. When they talk, notice <span>what causes their eyes their eyes to light up.</span> Pay attention to their posture. Once you start paying attention to the details, you’ll realize other humans are the most interesting thing in the world.</p> <p><strong>Counter-position.</strong> Don’t try to compete with their fantasy. Like Kellyanne Conway answering a question, just pitch a different one. If you suspect someone the fantasy in the future job is “I will make more money”, don’t immediately offer a raise. Pitch another something else, e.g: “there will be real opportunity for public recognition in this role”. <span>Don’t make your idea comparable to another idea.</span></p> <p><strong>Direct a movie.</strong> Suppose you want someone to quit smoking. The fantasy you want to plant is how youthful they’ll feel when they stop. The most effective way to incept a person isn’t to say those words. Instead, say something like: “it must feel wonderful to run 3 miles in the wilderness, take a breath of fresh air and really live life.” <span>Conduct a movie in the mind with words that evoke vivid imagery.</span> It makes for a much more engaging conversation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t pre-suppose solutions.</strong> Instead of thinking of what you want (“you should build this thing”), think of <em>why</em> you want it (“this thing could be really successful, if someone built it”). Try to formulate a narrative around the underlying motivations for the idea, and let them think of the actual concept themselves. <span>Give context, not commands.</span></p> <p><strong>Run a simulation.</strong> Think to yourself: “what would I be thinking if I was in that position?” To do this well, you must disentangle your own motivations. <span>Take your hat off. Put theirs on. Argue against yourself with them.</span> This helps convey that you’re really trying to see the problem from their side.</p> <p><strong>Pitch theoretically.</strong> When you’re in a biased position, don’t make any direct suggestions (“you should”). Your idea may get auto-rejected because of its origin. Instead, use yourself or a theoretical stranger (“I would…”, “boy <em>somebody</em> ought to…”).</p> <p><strong>Lastly, forget about yourself.</strong> <span>People frequently make the mistake of pitching ideas that will help them, not the other party.</span> This doesn’t work. Smart people have a very strong firewall for truly embracing an idea. To pass it you must really afford the other party something that they deeply want. Not what you want. That is a secondary goal.</p> </article></div>]]>

After well over 5 years of use, my old faithful finally died.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2.png" alt="Chromebook Pixel 2" srcset="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2.png 300w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2-197x300.png 197w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2-270x411.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Old faithful</figcaption></figure></div><p>I was sad to see it go – but I’m not too sentimental about machines. So I replaced it with a much cheaper model, and I hate it.</p><p>The device is actually perfect for the Chromebook part of its replacement – indeed I am using it right now (Google Docs, obvs). But it’s the hardware that’s letting it down. The Pixel 2 was a developer device, and as such it was easy to boot from the USB and whatnot.</p><p>But before this post becomes a Chromebook-off: it’s not. It’s more that my new device’s developer failings got me searching the internet for something new to play with, and I came across this: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://pine64.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PINE64</a>.</p><h2>Open source hardware</h2><p>Simply put, it’s an open source hardware/software combination of various flavours of Linux, SBCs (single board computers) and other smaller bits of hardware (eg, cameras).</p><figure><img src="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC.jpg" alt="PINEA64+ Single Board Computer" srcset="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC.jpg 600w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-370x219.jpg 370w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-270x160.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>The PINEA64+’s Single Board</figcaption></figure><p>They can be assembled together for whatever purpose you have – much like the Raspberry Pi.

Only a couple of weeks after finding PINE64, Apple <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announces</a> it is going to ditch Intel for ARM (more precisely, Apple Silicon – licenced ARM). Just like it did PowerPC for Intel back in 2005.</p><p>Now this is where I got excited.</p><p> I’m not an Apple fanboy (they produce very nice hardware and software, and it’s UNIX under the hood, what’s not to like?), but I like a more open source world (ChromeOS and Linux at home). But when a company the size of Apple decides to drop Intel for ARM, you know they’ve done the math, and it makes sense.</p><p>Intel’s x86 architecture is old (well, they both are: 1968 vs 1978) but because x86 never got subject to the low power, high efficiency life that ARM did (plus <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-i-hope-intels-avx-512-dies-a-painful-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">other bloat</a>), x86 got ‘fat’ and ARM got lean. 💪</p><p>So why am I so excited?</p><p>I think Apple moving towards entirely ARM compatible Macs and Macbooks will drive the ARM SBC market forward for developers (it’s difficult to develop on architecture X for architecture Y).</p><p>Hopefully that will be in a way that will lead to there being releases/hybrids/OS projects of Apple’s collections of OSes finding themselves running on boards like the RockPro64 (inside the Pinebook Pro).</p><p>Demand for these boards will go up, prices will come down (even more), components will become cheaper, and the whole ARM ecosystem benefits from having a giant player suddenly on board.</p><p>And if you’re a Linux guy (like most people here at 20i), we’re very, very well catered-for when it comes to ARM64 Desktop OSes: Debian and Fedora both have lovely graphical desktops.</p><p>Also, don’t forget the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300097/fugaku-supercomputer-worlds-fastest-top500-riken-fujitsu-arm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">world’s fastest computer</a> – is ARM.</p><figure><img src="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer.jpg" alt="Fugaku Supercomputer from Riken" srcset="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer.jpg 1366w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-300x101.jpg 300w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-768x259.jpg 768w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-370x125.jpg 370w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-270x91.jpg 270w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-740x249.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"><figcaption>The Fugaku Supercomputer (copyright: Riken)</figcaption></figure><h2>Servers next?</h2><p>And that brings us on to servers.

<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>

<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>

<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>

<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>

<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales. Sales is usually not the problem of the manufacturing team, but the novel highlights how defining a customer facing “global” goal transforms the poorly performing plant.</p>

October, 1953, I coined the word 'software.'</span>
<p><span size="+1">The notion of software as a separate thing from hardware
took years to assert itself. Sure, the computer (popularly referred to
as a "giant brain" in the early fifties) was unable to do anything but
consume electrical power until a "programmer" came along to "program" it,
and the consequent "routines" resided in the computer's "memory" thereafter.
One did not, in the beginning, take a program written for one computer
and put it into another.&nbsp; A half-century later, most people will find
that hard to imagine.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">As originally conceived, the word 'software' was merely
an obvious way to distinguish a program from the computer itself. A program
comprised sequences of written -- changeable -- instructions each endowed
with the power to command the behavior of the permanently crafted machinery
-- the "hardware."</span>
</p><p><a name="retdict"></a><span size="+1">For the origin of the word 'software,'
most <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppA.htm#typdict">dictionaries</a> give an unknown source
and 1960 as the date, but [expletive deleted] I was there! That's the only
exclamation point I intend to use in this introduction.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Fifty years ago, I was writing programs for the SWAC at
UCLA, one of only 16 digital computers in the whole U.S. When I was first
struck by the word 'software' (it was an epiphany), I shook my head and
chuckled.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">When I first said 'software' out loud, people around me
said, "Huh?" From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write
and often embarrassing to say. Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation
I did occasionally feature the word 'software' in speeches and lectures
and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span>
</p><p><a name="retneol"></a><span size="+1">It was just a throw-away thing.
The word 'software' was hardly my most notable invention, even back then.
Nothing to write home about (I was only 19 years old and still living at
home).&nbsp; The word 'software' did not belong in a technical paper (besides,
an undergraduate is but a ghostwriter for principal researchers).&nbsp;
Then too, I had a reputation at UCLA as a practical joker. Colleagues and
friends simply shrugged, no doubt regarding each utterance as a tiresome
prank or worse, another offbeat neologism, for which I was also becoming
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#sniglets">noted</a>.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Nobody in 1953 would have guessed that the silly word
would take hold, that within a few decades 'software' would enter the general
vocabulary for products and for professions -- that a worldwide industry
would wear it as a solemn name. You can be sure that if my ego and I had
harbored any such glorious visions, then... then, what?</span>
</p><p><a name="re38k"></a><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/a.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="33"><span color="#000000"><span size="+1">t
the time of this writing, there are about 4.2 million issued patents (I
once met Bob Hudson, inventor of an asphalt recycling machine for which
he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,000,000 -- but I digress). There must
be at least that many more worldwide -- a total, say, of 10 million. Every
patent has some number of "claims" (my largest -- ahem -- for the first
digital cassette recorder has 106 claims). Each patent-claim is, in effect,
a separate invention, an average of perhaps ten per patent. So there must
be at least a hundred million officially recognized inventions in the world.
Punch Line: There are only <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#38k">38,000 words</a> in the
English Language.</span></span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><i>Nota bene</i>, the hundred million issued patent-claims
officially recognize only a small fraction of the world's inventions, but
the rest are inventions just the same. An inventor does <i>not</i> apply
for patent protection for each and every idea before reducing it to practice.&nbsp;
Likewise, a person inventing a word does <i>not </i>submit it for publication
in a dictionary before speaking it or writing it.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">By comparison to other inventions, words are rare indeed.
One reason is that there is no commercial value to them, which is why patents
do not apply to words: You want to say "<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/101words/holomrph.htm">holomorph</a>"?
-- get out your checkbook. Copyrights don't make sense either, since a
word uncopied has no linguistic value at all. Trademarks, truth be known,
protect the interests of buyers not sellers; accordingly, a "wordmark"
would benefit listeners and readers not speakers and writers. Words are
<i>coined</i>
and thus spent -- circulated, borrowed, defaced, worn out, and lost.</span>
</p><p><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/d.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="30"><span size="+1">ictionaries
are not gate keepers like the Patent Office but merely infrequent periodicals,
passively reporting on linguistic usage, relying necessarily on snippets
in published documents -- in non-dictionaries. Once usage for an invented
word becomes established, however, the etymological trail gets cold quickly,
and if the original utterance is undocumented, even a linguistic bloodhound
may not pick up the scent of the true inventor. Pity the verbal coiner,
unrewarded, unacclaimed, unattested.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><span color="#000000">Inventors themselves, it seems plain,
do a whole lot better job of inventing <i>things</i> than inventing words
to call things. The bicycle got its 'pedal' from the piano, the engine
appropriated 'piston' from the trombone, the airplane named its 'fuselage'
from the sewing spindle and its 'empennage' from the tail feathers of an
arrow.&nbsp; </span>Millions of inventions apply to computers, both hardware
and software. Readers are invited to check <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/compsci.htm">What's
Not in a Name?</a> and <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/mukashi.htm">Mukashi </a>for
lamentations about the dearth of inventive language in 'The Software Age'.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">'The Software Age' -- now, there's an ambitious coinage.
The previous sentence deserves an exclamation point and so does the next
one. Without software, there would be neither "The Computer Age" nor "The
Information Age."&nbsp; Same for "The Space Age."&nbsp; Meanwhile, is "The
Atomic Age" officially over? How much longer will "The Petroleum Age" last?
Accordingly, does 'The Software Age<b>'</b> have any real competition?</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">All right, so one can get a patent on an invention, a
copyright on a book, a trademark on a name, but what does one get to assert
primacy as the originator of a word? As noted above, t<span color="#000000">here
is no proprietary instrument that protects a word. Nor, of course, would
one want one ("I'll sue you if you use that term, I have the 'wordright'
on it"). On the contrary, t</span>he idea is to put each coinage into currency,
not horde it away.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">And then the grandkids grow up and there comes a time
to write one's memoirs.&nbsp; This one is dedicated to my first great-grandchild,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.15.3"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>I’ve recently co-founded a startup, and after working so long in more mature enterprises with diverse toolchains, it was actually massively educational to return to first steps and figure out what our critical needs were, balanced with essentially zero budget. As we’ve grown and raised money, we’ve graduated in some areas to other tools, but I wanted to share what we felt were the absolute can’t-live-without-tools for a team building SaaS software. I don’t have any vested interest in any of these apps, they’re just the ones we settled on as we spun up, they worked perfectly, integrated where we needed, and were either free or very cheap.</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-33kep"><p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Google Apps</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> We knew going in we’d want to centralize authentication around Google SSO, and didn’t want to have to go back later and move everything over after setting up simple sign-in. A bonus for us has been how strong Google now plays with Microsoft docs - when we receive Keypoint presos, Excel sheets, Word docs like MSAs etc., we’re able to do everything in Google and send it back, and not a one of us have a MS license. And an added unexpected bonus has been that Google Meet (or whatever its called this week) has worked surprisingly well for our internal meetings and standups etc. And at $6 per user pm, it fit our budget.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-fdt4q"><p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Slack</strong></u></span></a><span>. No-brainer. Used free for months, and only started paying once we wanted to bring in external users etc., and even then it’s insanely cheap for the value we derive.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-7irdv"><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>AWS</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re building on AWS, and never really considered using anything else. There are a number of ways to get your hands on AWS credits too, some banks (eg </span><a href="https://www.svb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>SVB</u></span></a><span>) offer startup credits, as well as some credit cards etc. - we found that by leveraging our networks and partners we were able to get most of our AWS usage free for the first year, which is massive when there’s no revenue.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4mdtf"><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Jira</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re all Atlassian old-timers, so didn’t really consider anything else, and it being free to start again matches our budget. We have looked at a few other issue trackers eg Clubhouse since starting up to figure out integrations, and tbh just aren’t seeing that anything yet comes close to the power of Jira’s workflows, issue states, etc. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-48g4s"><p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Github</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>/</span></strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Bitbucket</strong></u></span></a><span>. Not much to say here, you gotta put your code somewhere and we’re using both for various projects. And they’re only getting more free by the day. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-576uc"><p><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Quickbooks</strong></u></span></a><span>. I tried out a few different tools for managing accounting and HR etc., but found that Quickbooks has everything you need to start out, and I’m amazed that every time I want to go do something new the functionality is there. We started out only paying $28 for QBO which is nuts given we were able to tie together all our bank/card accounts, do budgeting, pay bills, run payroll (once we started paying people), etc. and are only up to $70 now with the additional modules we’ve added. Such a great value.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-3drp4"><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Stripe</strong></u></span></a><span>. We need to be able to bill customers, and can’t even begin to think about PCI compliance right now. Stripe integration with our app was brain-dead simple, and the cost is peanuts compared to the value we get, especially given they only get paid when we do.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4fpta"><p><a href="https://reclaim.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Reclaim</strong></u></span></a><span>. We didn’t know we needed Reclaim until we did. Startup life began as a welcome return to meeting-free days with time to work and GSD… for like two weeks. Reclaim works perfectly and noise-lessly to manage our calendars, and is free.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-34v18"><p><a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Miro</strong></u></span></a><span>. From day one, our team was remote, with team members ranging from San Francisco to Boulder to Slovenia. I was initially suspicious of a whiteboarding app that might whistle me back to the kind of horrid multi-day “planning offsite” navel-gazing exercises that I’ve come to dread, but we’ve found Miro to be awesome for working thru ideas with remote team members. And again, free. Amazing.</span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-b9h22"><span>That’s it, that’s what you need to start. Everything a SaaS startup needs to get up and running, for under $100 a month. </span></p><p id="viewer-61iv0"><span>--- </span></p><p id="viewer-8hurk"><span><strong>Epilogue</strong></span> </p><p id="viewer-dpf11"><span>As we’ve grown, there are other apps we’ve added or replaced. We needed a CI tool so we went with CircleCI. We eventually outgrew QBO for payroll once we added health insurance benefits and international payments so went to Rippling for that portion, still keeping QBO for everything else. We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month. It’s a great age to build a company with the wealth of inexpensive, amazing tools on the market.</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

July 28, 2020 | https://vriad.com/essays/a-modest-proposal-for-oss-sustainability | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vriad.com/essays/a-modest-proposal-for-oss-sustainability">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've wanted to join YC for the last 8 years. I've applied to and been rejected by YC three times.</p><p>But when we got into YC with <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a>, we turned it down. Here’s why…</p><h2 id="yc-as-an-employee">YC as an Employee</h2><p>I first learned about YC in 2012 from <a href="https://twitter.com/zebulgar">a friend</a> who was obsessed with startups. Soon, all of my smartest friends were dropping out of school to do YC. In 2014, I joined them by bailing on an internship to work for <a href="http://picnichealth.com/">Picnic Health</a> as they went through YC S14.</p><p>That summer I lived in a house in Redwood City with the rest of the team. YC forced us to focus and make progress each week. This culminated in Demo Day which allowed us to raise a seed round without much real traction.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_8nvbj2oFDnwe9iRc.jpg" alt="The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF."><figcaption>The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF.</figcaption></figure><p>At my mom's urging, I left Picnic Health to finish college, but that summer left a lasting impression. After graduating and joining <a href="http://benchling.com/">Benchling</a> (another YC startup), I watched jealously as friends started companies and got into YC.</p><h2 id="rejected-rejected-rejected-accepted">Rejected, Rejected, Rejected, Accepted</h2><p>After leaving Benchling to start my own company, I quickly learned that starting a company was much harder than expected. I applied to YC and got rejected. Rinse and repeat. I ended up starting 3 companies and getting rejected from YC three times.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_eGdhBVmpHcqwD4nj.png" alt="Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with Scooter Map."><figcaption>Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with <a href="https://scootermap.com/">Scooter Map</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>This March, as COVID spread in the US, I stayed up late talking with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/danqing_liu">Danqing</a> about what we could do to help. From these conversations, we built <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a> to help <a href="https://zmurl.com/whit2">a friend of mine</a> sell tickets to her Zoom Yoga classes.</p><p>In just a week, ZmURL went from an idea to being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">featured on TechCrunch</a>. To keep up with the growth, we focused on building product 7 days a week. For one weekend we took a break to lift our heads up, talk about the future, and to apply to YC.</p><p>To my surprise, after getting rejected three times, we got into YC for the current batch. Even more surprisingly, after weighing our options, we decided to turn down YC.</p><p>I realized that we applied to YC just because it was "the thing to do" and that YC is no longer the right fit for every startup. </p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_dTo3agVed4ANcClE.png" alt="The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever."><figcaption>The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-benefits-of-yc">The Benefits of YC</h2><p>Before explaining why we turned down YC, it's helpful to know what makes YC so awesome. From going thru YC with Picnic Health, YC helped us with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — Learn how to startup. Attend inspirational dinners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — You're forced to deliver results every week. Compete with your batchmates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network</strong> — Bond with other smart founders. Reach out to YC alums</p></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — YC is cool, it's cool to be part of YC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you are selling to startups, YC is full of them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — Demo Day builds buzz and FOMO.</p></li></ul><h2 id="yc-without-yc">YC Without YC</h2><p>Today, many of these benefits can be gained without joining YC while other aspects of YC have gotten worse due to the increased the batch size.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — YC has open sourced <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> and <a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/">Startup Class</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — Write a <a href="https://victor.pont.is/article/weekly-update">weekly update</a> to friends or post your progress to Twitter.</p></li><li><div><p><strong>Network</strong> — Join an early stage startup. Meet interesting people online.</p><p>I was able to build an invaluable network of mentors over the past 5 years working at startups and starting companies in San Francisco. I've made interesting friends from posting on Twitter and reaching out just to chat with interesting people. (See Tweet below.)</p></div></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — You can build a personal brand by writing online, but the YC brand is very good.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you aren't selling to startups, you don't benefit as much from YC’s network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — From the founders I've talked to, the first remote Demo Day failed. This could have been due to COVID, so it'll be interesting to see how the next Demo Day goes...</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_3qWItqVzC2aoeI6N.png" alt="I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter. In March, this Tweet led to Techcrunch covering the launch of ZmURL."><figcaption>I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter. In March, this Tweet led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">Techcrunch covering the launch of ZmURL</a>.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="who-should-do-yc">Who Should do YC</h2><p>YC is still the best tech accelerator and they are doing amazing work to make starting companies more accessible. YC is a great fit for you if are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A Tech Outsider</strong> — YC helps you meet other founders and can introduce you to any VC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selling to Startups</strong> — Stripe, Segment, Gusto, and Brex grew quickly by selling to other YC companies. As a YC founder, it's easy to reach out to alums and pitch them, although this is getting worse as the large batch sizes dilute the network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hungry for Prestige</strong> — YC used to be for outsiders. "Why would you start a company instead of work for Google?" But now joining YC is cool, so it's a valuable stop on the Harvard → McKinsey → MBA trajectory. (This has also contributed to YC's dilution.)</p></li></ul><p>While increasing the batch size is the right thing for YC (and for the world), it's made the experience worse for founders who get less facetime with partners and end up directly competing with batchmates. While YC told us there wouldn't be competitors in our batch, we've already seen at least 3 very similar companies in the current YC batch...</p><p>After weighing our options, we decided to skip YC and to try to raise a seed round. I'll talk about how that went in my next post...</p></div></div>]]>

But, until now, there has been little independent research published on their performance (both relative to each other and against state of the art open source models). We ran a standard dataset through all three tools to see how they stack up against each other.</p><p>If you are considering using computer vision services from Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure in your product (or you have trained an object detection model of your own and are wondering where you stand in comparison to AutoML) this is the post for you.</p><p>In this post, we review <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/">Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Azure Custom Vision</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl">Google Cloud AutoML Vision</a>. We'll weigh the pros/cons between them and we'll also compare them against results from <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5">YOLOv5x</a>, a current-generation open source model.</p><p>We evaluate each product on the following factors:</p><ul><li>Training Time (how long to train the model)</li><li>Training Cost (how much to train the model)</li><li>Model Performance (how accurate is the model)</li><li>Inference Time (how long to predict on a test image)</li><li>Inference Costs (how much to predict once on a test image)</li></ul><p>We also provide insight into the major limitations of each platform and ease of use.</p><h3 id="summary-">Summary:</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg" alt="google cloud automl vs aws rekognition vs azure custom-vision" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>Our overall conclusion:</strong> AutoML tools are a great way to assess the feasibility of a computer vision project, even if you plan to eventually train a custom model architecture. Evaluating tradeoffs among the big three cloud providers depends on your project specifications (how important is inference speed; what accuracy threshold is required; what inference volume do you expect; what is the size of your dataset). Open source model architectures, while expensive to build and maintain, perform on par with big cloud provider options.</p><p>Unfortunately, each platform uses its own proprietary API and data format so it is very cumbersome to get started and compare solutions. Moreover, once you're up and running, you're locked in. (Luckily, <a href="https://roboflow.ai/">Roboflow</a> solves this by seamlessly integrating with all three.)</p><h2 id="overview-of-the-automl-process">Overview of the AutoML Process</h2><p>No matter which platform you choose, you will be entering a similar workflow to create and deploy your computer vision model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-54.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The AutoML Process in a diagram</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data Preparation</strong> - In order to train a computer vision model, you first need to acquire images that appear in your domain of interest. The narrower you keep your domain the better your model will perform. Then, your images will need to be labeled providing supervision to train your model to learn the vision concepts in question.</p><p><strong>Model Training and Evaluation</strong> - you will kick of training, a process where the computer formulates an algorithm based on training images to apply to images that it has never seen. Your model will then be evaluated based on how well it performs during predictions. This may be an iterative process as you add data and adjust training length. </p><p><strong>Model Deployment and Inference - </strong>Once you have a suitable model, you will deploy this model to a compute instance and stand up an API endpoint that you can hit to receive predictions based on what your model is seeing in your production images. </p><p>The cloud providers separate data labeling from AutoML, and we will be focusing on reviewing the AutoML service in this post, <strong>assuming you have already collected a labeled dataset.</strong></p><h2 id="the-big-cloud-automl-challenge-ms-coco">The Big Cloud AutoML Challenge - MS COCO</h2><p>The original plan was to benchmark these services on the modern standard, the <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">Microsoft Common Objects in Context Object Detection</a> (COCO) dataset.</p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>all three tools failed this challenge</strong> and we were unable to complete training on COCO.</p><p><strong>Rekognition Custom Labels</strong><em> -</em> has a hard-cap on the maximum training time of 72 node-hours per job. If your dataset takes longer than that to converge, the job will time out. Rekognition did not complete the MS COCO job before its time limit was exceeded and, thus, failed our test. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/limits.html">Limits Page</a></p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML</strong> - there was a limit of 100MB for annotation upload. We were able to work around this by splitting the file into several chunks but the estimated budget for training MS COCO on Google Cloud AutoML was $6000. Sorry, but there's no way we're spending that on a blog post... <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/object-detection/quotas">Quotas and Limits Page</a></p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision</strong> - maxes out at 100,000 training images (COCO has over 200,000). <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/limits-and-quotas">Limits and Quotas Page</a></p><h2 id="the-big-cloud-automl-challenge-pascal-voc">The Big Cloud AutoML Challenge - Pascal VOC</h2><p>In order to compare the accuracy of AutoML vision solutions, we fell back to an older benchmark object detection task, the<a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/"> Pascal VOC 2012 Object Detection dataset</a>.</p><p><strong>The object detection task - </strong>Object detection challenges the computer to learn to draw bounding boxes around objects belonging to collection of object classes of interest.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-55.png" alt=""><figcaption>Azure Custom Vision displays an image in Pascal VOC</figcaption></figure><p>The Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has 13,690 training images and 3,428 validation images across 20 object classes.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-56.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-56.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-56.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-56.png 1324w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The class distribution for the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset (via <a href="https://docs.roboflow.ai/dataset-health-check">Roboflow Dataset Health Check</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>Pascal VOC withholds the dataset's test set so we evaluate the cloud platforms with their performance on the validation set.</p><h2 id="training-costs">Training Costs</h2><p>Once you have loaded your dataset into Amazon Rekognition, Google Cloud AutoML Vision, or Azure Custom Vision, you are ready to train your model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-57.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-57.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-57.png 1449w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Kicking off training on Pascal VOC in Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</figcaption></figure><p>Training a model is a computationally intensive task, as the computer iterates through your dataset it will be optimizing millions of neural network parameters. To do this efficiently, the AutoML services will boot up GPU nodes.</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Cost - </strong>Training is started and runs until the model has reached maximum performance. You are unable to control how long training occurs for. Training costs $1/hr/instance and Amazon may provision multiple compute instances to train your model. So your training job may complete in two hours but you will be billed for more if more instances were started. Training can run for a maximum of 72 node hours. If it times out, your training cost is refunded. Be careful, you cannot stop training jobs that have started! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/pricing/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Cost - </strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision trains their model with 8 nodes with Tesla V100 GPUs. Each node hour is $3.15/hr, so ~$25 per wall clock hour. AutoML Vision allows you the ability to start, stop, and resume model training, which can be nice to anticipate the costs before the training job has started. There is no limit to the amount of training time you can provision in Google Cloud AutoML Vision. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/pricing">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Cost - </strong>Azure Custom Vision is less verbose in explaining their training costs - it costs $20/compute hour, but the underlying hardware is undisclosed so it is unclear how this stacks up against the Google and Amazon price/performance. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><h2 id="training-time">Training Time</h2><p>It is hard to benchmark training costs without factoring in training time. Each service may be running a larger or smaller model architecture, and may have varying levels of training time software optimization.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/ezgif.com-video-to-gif--10-.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Waiting for training to complete in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>When starting your training job, you have the ability to choose between large or compact models based on your downstream inference time needs in Azure and Google Cloud. Amazon Rekognition just provides one size fits all. </p><p>Smaller models train faster, infer faster, but perform less well.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-59.png" alt=""><figcaption>Choosing model size in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>In this face off, we optimized all models for accuracy (and tried to train with a similar budget).</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Time- </strong>Rekognition completed the training job on the Pascal VOC 2012 training set in 26 node hours, costing $26. To make a fair comparison, we sought to use this as our training budget across platforms.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Time - </strong>To stick with with the Rekognition training cost baseline, we would need to use 9 node hours in Google Cloud AutoML Vision, but the minimum time allowed was 20 hours for our PascalVOC 2012 dataset, costing $60. The <strong>recommended</strong> training time was 1,080 node hours - which would have cost a whopping $3402. We chose to train for the minimum time allowed (which still cost &gt;2x Rekognition).</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Time - </strong>Sticking with the Rekognition baseline, we provisioned 1 hour of training time for Azure Custom Vision, costing $20.</p><p>It is worth noting that Google Cloud AutoML Vision and Azure Custom Vision could have likely earned better evaluation performance with a larger training budget. Rekognition does not let you configure this tradeoff at all.</p><h2 id="reported-evaluation-metrics">Reported Evaluation Metrics</h2><p>Object detection systems are rated by <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">the mean average precision metric</a>, a measure of how well the model is detecting objects in test images that it has never seen.</p><p>Google Cloud AutoML Vision is the only platform that reports unbiased evaluation metrics. <strong>Azure Custom Vision and Rekognition are slanting their results in their favor.

Several teams that&nbsp;ranked behind the Iroquois Nationals have been invited to compete in Alabama.</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee —&nbsp;a confederacy of six First Nations: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora Nations — invented lacrosse and call it the&nbsp;Creator's Game.</p>  <p>The Iroquois Nationals are member in good standing of World Lacrosse. But it's the International World Games Association (IWGA) that determines eligibility for the Alabama tournament.</p>  <p>The IWGA has not responded to requests for comment. The organizing committee for the World Games in Birmingham&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/petition-calls-for-boycott-of-world-lacrosse-games-after-iroquois-nationals-excluded/">told APTN</a>&nbsp;that IWGA follows the&nbsp;criteria established by the International Olympics Committee, which states that "the expression country means an independent State recognized by the international community."</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy more than meets that definition, says Iroquois Nationals executive director Leo Nolan, a Mohawk from the Onondaga Nation. Here is part of his conversation with&nbsp;<em>As It Happens </em>guest host Susan Bonner.</p>  <p><strong>Take us through the moment you found out the Nationals were not invited to the World Games. What was your reaction?</strong></p>  <p>We found out through a third party in late September, early October.</p>  <p>We immediately sent a letter to World Lacrosse asking about our lack of inclusion. And the response back was that we didn't meet what they believed were — and this is their belief — that we wouldn't meet that criteria as a nation state to be included in the Olympics.</p>  <p>All of this is a precursor of the Olympics, which, you know, we're right now on provisional status, lacrosse as a sport. And once the provisional status is lifted, then hopefully lacrosse will be reintroduced to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The Iroquois Nationals travel with Haudenosaunee passports — a fact that has led to travel delays in previous competitions. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Candace Maracle)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How does the team rank worldwide?</strong></p>  <p>In the men's ... we are third in the world. And we've won the bronze medal the last two competitions, in 2014 in Denver and then in 2018 in Israel.</p>  <p>In the indoor game, we've won a silver every year it's been competed since 2003.</p>  <p><strong>So what do you think this is about then, Mr. Nolan?</strong></p>  <p>I'm not one to point fingers or to speak ill of anyone. I mean, I don't think that's the way we should operate in this time and age.</p>  <p>I think part of it could be a lack of appreciation, understanding and just basic knowledge about who&nbsp;we are as a nation state, so to speak.&nbsp;</p>  <p>There's always speculation about, you know, racism, and I think that it's wrong for us to even push that kind of thing. I don't have strong evidence of that aspect of it, and I don't think that that's the way we want to go forward with this. So I think it's more a lack of ...&nbsp;understanding our status.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>We are the originators of the game.

DNS-over-HTTPS isn’t used by Firefox and Google because it’s </span><i><span>superior</span></i><span> to DoT. It’s used because browsers operate at the HTTPS layer by default, so DNS-over-TLS doesn’t make sense (as things stand now) for a browser to implement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Google can’t use DNS-over-TLS in their browser because they can’t modify the code on Windows or MacOS operating systems (which only support DoT at the moment)&nbsp; in order to encrypt DNS requests done outside of the browser. And that works for Google and Firefox, because they only need to encrypt DNS requests </span><i><span>inside</span></i><span> of their browsers.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile at DNSFilter, we need to operate DNS encryption not just in the browser, but at the operating system level. That’s why we use DNS-over-TLS: Because it can be enabled at a </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> layer and protect DNS requests outside of the browser (e.g. Slack messages, links embedded in Excel, or miscellaneous desktop applications). And right now, DoT is the primary way to enable standardized DNS encryption at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Note that DoH is being enabled at the OS level for new versions of iOS, MacOS, and Windows. Because Android is a Google product, and Google Chrome uses DoH, Android devices are already using DoH at the operating system level.</span></p><h2><span>Which is better?</span></h2><p><span>DoH is on everyone’s minds because it’s what Google uses, but it’s not necessarily </span><i><span>better</span></i><span> than DoT. It’s just </span><i><span>different</span></i><span>, and in some ways it’s actually inferior to DoT.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a lot of ways, DoT is more efficient because of which layer within the TCP/IP model it is enabled in. Remember, DoH is </span><b>two</b><span> layers removed from the internet layer while DoT is only </span><b>one</b><span> layer removed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because there is another layer of encapsulation in DoH, it results in:</span></p><ul><li><span>More coding required</span></li><li><span>More libraries required</span></li><li><span>Packet sizes are larger than DoT</span></li><li><span>Ever-so-slightly higher latency</span></li></ul><p><span>These are a few of the reasons why DNSFilter chose DoT over DoH. Basically, we would have needed to send more data across another layer. Though it should be noted that both DoT </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> DoH increase latency, DoT has lower latency because of where it’s enabled.</span></p><p><span>But the most important reason for us, and our users, in choosing DoT was the ability to enable DNS encryption at the </span><i><span>lowest possible layer</span></i><span> since our users do not just send DNS requests over their browsers. That’s why we use DoT.</span></p><p><span>But that doesn’t mean we think DoT is the </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> answer. We </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> planning on having a DoH implementation for clients who need it.</span></p><p><span>As an example, Android devices, such as Chromebooks, use DoH. This is because Android devices were created by Google. While Windows and MacOS do not currently support DoH, Google was able to modify their Android devices so that DoH would be possible.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-is-adding-dns-over-https-doh-to-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Microsoft has even announced adding support for DoH</span></a><span>, while also keeping their DoT support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though, just because Microsoft supports DoH for their operating system doesn’t mean the higher latency or additional coding requirements go away. No matter what, DoH is still implemented at a higher layer than DoT. The only change would be that now DoH can be implemented at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This addition of DoH support is likely less about Microsoft giving their users more options and more about them following Google’s lead.</span></p><h2><span>Other DNS protocol variations</span></h2><p><span>DoH and DoT are not the only encryption protocols available, though at this point they are more robust and the most widely used. But before encryption standards were available, there was also DNSSEC.</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC was an early DNS standard that provided </span><i><span>no</span></i><span> encryption or privacy for your DNS requests. It </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. And if it is not applied properly, it will </span><i><span>break</span></i><span> your website. </span><a href="https://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>You can check out a feed of websites broken by improper DNSSEC implementations here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC is prone to frequent outages and it was never widely adopted. Due to that, and because it only does a portion of what DoH and DoT do, are just a few reasons that at DNSFilter we don’t recommend using DNSSEC, though we do support it.</span></p><p><span>DNSCrypt is another DNS encryption option, though far less popular than the two protocols we’re comparing right now. Like DNS-over-TLS, it is applied at the transport layer. DNSCrypt prevents localized man-in-the-middle attacks and encrypts DNS traffic between the user and recursive DNS servers, though it does not provide end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the biggest difference between DNSCrypt and other standards (like DoT) is that there is no </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RFC</span></a><span> (Request for Comments) like there is for DoH or DoT. This means it hasn’t been peer-reviewed and battle-tested. Implementations can vary greatly, and all of the definitions and specifications for DNSCrypt come from a single source.</span></p><p><span>You can access the RFCs for </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoH</span></a><span> here.</span></p><h2><span>DNS encryption is </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> evolving</span></h2><p><span>There is no right answer when it comes to DoT or DoH, because these standards support varying use cases. But if DoH continues to be adopted like it has been, we might see DoT go by the wayside.</span></p><p><span>With that being said, it’s not just a matter of choosing DoT or DoH. There is still work that needs to be done in both DNS encryption </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> SNI (Server Name Indication) encryption.</span></p><p><span>SNI is the layer above TLS and an extension of the TLS layer. Once you make a DNS request and TLS makes a secure connection with that IP address, SNI tells the server in clear text (not encrypted) what the name of that domain is. While this does not impact things like man-in-the-middle attacks, it </span><i><span>does</span></i><span> impact privacy. Currently, SNI is </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> encrypted, though it is something that is being worked on.</span></p><p><span>While DoT and DoH are the most secure and standardized methods for encrypting DNS, they </span><i><span>do not</span></i><span> encrypt the request that goes to the authoritative DNS. That request is received in clear text. This is a point of vulnerability in both DoT and DoH, as well as DNSCrypt. Right now there is no standard for encrypting this information.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png" data-src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png" alt="authoritative dns" width="600" height="145" data-srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png 1920w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-300x73.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1024x248.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-768x186.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1536x372.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-500x121.png 500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png 1920w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-300x73.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1024x248.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-768x186.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1536x372.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-500x121.png 500w"></p><p>As a DNS resolver, we support and welcome a standard for encrypting messages to authoritative DNS, and we’d love to work with providers to help put this in place.</p><p><span>But the point I’m trying to make here is that neither DoT nor DoH are perfect DNS encryption solutions at this moment.

With DoH becoming the de facto standard, it makes performing DoH bypasses on system-level DNS settings nearly impossible. There’s no standard method at this time for alternative workarounds. We’ll go into this subject in more detail in a later blog post, as there is a lot to consider when discussing the impact on MSPs.</span></p><p><span>For more reading on DNS-over-TLS and how it’s implemented by DNSFilter, </span><a href="https://docs.dnsfilter.com/docs/dns-over-tls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>visit our support documentation</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>When we first</strong> <strong>conceived of Density six years ago</strong>, we just wanted to know if there was a line at our favorite coffee shop. We thought it was odd there was an API for inclement weather but there wasn't an API for how many people were in a space. We reasoned, if a solution didn't already exist â€” which surely it must â€” it shouldn't be more than a weekend project. How hard could it be to count people?</p>



<p>We were optimistic and wrong by about three years. As we tried to solve our own problem, we learned two important lessons. First, people are weird. They do things you wouldn't expect â€” they bump into each other, take phone calls, and they bring a lot of stuff with them: bags and boxes, bicycles and baskets, tv's and trash cans, chairs, carts, iPads, lunch, even other people sometimes. This makes counting them unfathomably complex. You can't fault commodity products for being bad at the analysis. People are just really weird.</p>



<p>Second, we learned we weren't alone. We met hundreds and now thousands of others trying to answer the same question â€” how many people used my office, bank, lounge, desk, space, floor, building, campusâ€¦ city. If only we knew, we could reduce waste and energy use, improve access and productivity, clean the spaces that need it and skip the ones that don't. If only we knew, we could A/B test physical space or even use less concrete! If only we knew how the world was used, we could measure how it works, identify its inefficiencies, and remake it.</p>



<p>Until recently, we had been helping hundreds of companies do just this â€” quantify how buildings were used so they could design them more effectively. Today, things have changed. We've been asked to help those same companies and hundreds more reopen their buildings and businesses safely. We're helping them avoid leases they don't need in order to prioritize payroll. We're working to keep meat processing plants, distribution centers, manufacturers, offices, universities, even an entire village in Ohio open and safe.</p>



<p>The built world was modernizing before the pandemic. It will continue to modernize well after it's over. In the meantime, we're proud to say we're not going anywhere and we're eager to help.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Farah, Density CEO</em></p>

<p><em>*Density will be using this investment to support its rapidly scaling customer base â€” customer success, sales, infrastructure, ops, manufacturing, engineering, and core product.

Despite looking quite comprehensive, I was surprised to see that quite a few of Thiel’s online writings were absent from the references section. Maybe the creators of the document left those out on purpose, but I suspect they might just not have been aware of them. A lot of Thiel’s online writings appear in relatively obscure places, and I haven’t been able to find a good list that includes all of them.

<p><code><pre>gcc main.c

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, you'll find an interactive visualization that you can use to simulate regular expressions. &nbsp;You can type any regular expression and the tool will automatically create two diagrams that correspond to your regular expression. &nbsp;Both of these diagrams are interactive, zoomable and include support for a fullscreen mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first diagram is a parse tree. &nbsp;Constructing a parse tree is the first step that a regular expression engine will perform in order to decide what meaning each character will have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can click on individual nodes in the parse tree to highlight the corresponding character in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can also go the other way and click on individual characters in the regular expression to quickly find the corresponding characters in the parse tree. &nbsp;By reviewing how the characters are grouped together in the parse tree, you can gain insights about the meanings of individual characters and how they relate to each other in the regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second diagram shows a control flow graph corresponding to your regular expression. &nbsp;This control flow graph illustrates the step by step process that is undertaken whenever your regex is matched against a piece of text. &nbsp; When attempting to match your regular expression, the process starts at the 'BEGIN' node and ends at either the 'MATCH' or 'FAILURE' node. &nbsp;Any path from the 'BEGIN' node to the 'MATCH' node corresponds to a piece of text that matches your regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the nodes in the control flow graph correspond directly to one or more characters in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see the corresponding nodes highlighted in your original regular expression and the parse tree. &nbsp;Also note that clicking on characters in your regex will also highlight any associated nodes in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's difficult to truly understand how your regular expression works without seeing the decisions it makes when attempting to match a given piece of text. &nbsp;For this reason, every time you make changes to your regular expression, this visualization tool will automatically generate a piece of text that contains at least one match to your regular expression. &nbsp;If you want to review how the matching process work with your own customized piece of text, simply change the input value for the search string and the animation will update automatically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of matching the regular expression starts at the 'BEGIN' node and continues by following the arrows to arrive at the nodes that actually do the work of the regular expression itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of writing this sentence, all regular expressions that this visualizer tool supports are ultimately transformed into an control flow graph that consists of the following 5 types of nodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) &nbsp;<strong>CHAR</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a specific character at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;If the character matches, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>2) &nbsp;<strong>CLASS</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a class of characters at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;This node type effectively does the same thing as the first node type, except it allows for more than one possible character at the current position in the search text. &nbsp;If the current character in the text is among the list of acceptable characters specified by this node, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>3) &nbsp;<strong>SPLIT</strong>&nbsp;This node type performs a 'split' operation. &nbsp;This is a situation where the regular expression matcher has a more than one possible path to continue through the control flow graph. &nbsp;In programming terms, this node effectively does the same thing as forking a process or splitting off work into two separate threads. &nbsp;This can also be implemented in a single thread by trying both paths one at time and pushing saved information onto a stack. &nbsp;In computer science theory, this node type should remind you of the difference between DFAs and NFAs.</li>
<li>4) &nbsp;<strong>ANCHOR</strong>&nbsp;This node type represents the commonly used 'beginning of string' or 'end of string' regular expression characters. &nbsp;This node is type is quite simple, as it simply checks whether the current position in the string is, respectively, at the first position, or the last position. &nbsp;If the check succeeds, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>5) &nbsp;<strong>PROGRESS</strong>&nbsp;This node type is necessary to avoid infinite loops in certain regular expressions that can include repetitions of possibly zero length strings. &nbsp;Without this node, there are cases where the control flow graph could potentially contain cycles that cause us to move around forever without making any progress. &nbsp;Each time a progress node is visited, it makes sure that we've made some progress in matching the regex since the last visit. &nbsp;If we have made progress, we move to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If not, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may find it surprising, but most commonly used regular expressions can be described in terms of the above 5 simple node types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of this visualization tool is help you understand the precise meaning of the characters in a regular expression. &nbsp;Therefore, this the tool will also cross-compile your regular expression into a hard-coded C program that implements a search for the regex pattern that you specified. &nbsp;Each of the nodes in the control flow graph has a direct correspondence to several lines of C source code that are expressed below the two diagrams. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see which lines of code correspond to the node that you've selected.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_this_character(current_character, CHARACTER_TO_MATCH)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the implementation of a 'CHAR' node, we first use the 'safely_get_character' function to pick out the next character from the string being searched. &nbsp;The implementation of the 'safely_get_character' function is listed above in the 'Common C Code' section. &nbsp;This function is very simple since it just checks to make sure we're still within the bounds of the string that's being search, and if so, it returns character at the current position. &nbsp;If we're past the end of the string, we just directly exit the process. &nbsp;This corresponds to moving to the 'failure' node in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we've obtained the current character, we check to make sure that it matches the literal character that was specified in the regular expression using the 'matches_this_character' function. &nbsp;Here is the implementation of the matches_this_character function. &nbsp;As you can see, this function is very simple since it just checks to make sure that the current character in the string being searched is the same as the literal character that was supplied in the regex.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_one_of_these_characters(current_character, NUM_CHARACTERS, CHARACTER_1, CHARACTER_2, CHARACTER_3, ..., CHARACTER_N)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the 'CLASS' node …</p></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>After starting to use <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2019/12/30/cracking-the-human-memory/">spaced repetition more actively</a> and being <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/05/24/bullet-journaling/">more consistent with my journaling</a>, now I've tackled improving my note taking skills.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, I've read about various note-taking methods, different approaches and diverse goals for them and they helped me change my perspective on collecting ideas.</p><h2 id="my-previous-approaches-to-taking-notes">My previous approaches to taking notes</h2><p>While I was still in school, I didn't take too good notes. I guess the Romanian educational system is not set up to encourage that kind of critical thinking which leads to taking good notes. In most classes, the teacher would dictate a lesson, I would write that down and then memorize it, without needing to create my own summarized version of the lesson.</p><p>Then I took notes in Google Keep. When it came out, I was impressed by how simple and snappy it was, compared to Evernote for example. I've used it for around 6 years, so I have a lot of notes jotted down there. But Keep doesn't offer good ways to organize notes, having only tags and search. But to search, you have to remember something to look for, so it's almost impossible to find notes which you have forgotten.</p><p>As I've started moving my notes from Keep to Obsidian, I found a lot of old notes which I had totally forgotten about. Some of those notes were ideas I had, but I never followed up on them. Looking back they were good ideas: I know because in the meantime other people have implemented them.</p><h2 id="goals-of-a-note-taking-system">Goals of a note taking system</h2><p>A goal of a note taking system should be to store information, so that your brain can do more fun/useful stuff.</p><p>But another goal is to help you connect ideas, even from different domains. As you read things in books, blogs, or come up with ideas on your own, eventually some of them will be related and can be combined to make something even better. The note taking system should facilitate creating these connections.</p><p>It should also help you process your notes. A note is not a static thing. It's not something you just write down and then never touch again. Almost all ideas will eventually need refining. When you read a book and find something noteworthy, you write some notes, but in time you find that you can reword it better, as you understand things better. For your own ideas, in time you add something; you cut some things, hopefully making them better and then you create something with them.</p><p>Lastly, the note organizing system should help you organize and browse your notes. It should encourage serendipitous rediscovery of forgotten notes. It should help visualize them. It should make it easy to see all notes that are related to a certain note or to a certain topic.</p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-5.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-5.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-5.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Meta: Writing this post in Obsidian. Left: folder pane; middle: raw markdown; right: Rendered note</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a new desktop app for creating a "A second brain, for you, forever.". It's quite new, it was released publicly two months ago and it's not even at version 1.0, but development is progressing quite quickly, with a new version coming out almost weekly.</p><p>Obsidian is built around Markdown files, which means that the notes are portable and won't get stuck in an old program, should the company go out of business. It enhances the Markdown syntax with the some shortcuts for creating connections between pages using <code>[[name of other page]]</code> syntax. You can see for each page what other pages link back to it. There's also a way to embed one file (or part of a file) into another one. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-6.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-6.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-6.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The graph view</figcaption></figure><p>One cool looking feature in Obsidian is the graph view, where you can visualize how your notes are connected. This leads to some interesting looking "constellations". </p><p>There are also plugins available. For now, the API is internal, so all the plugins are made by the same company, but they say that once they reach 1.0, they will make the API public. </p><p>Because Obsidian is based on Markdown files, you can store them wherever you want and you can sync them across devices with your favorite syncing tool. So far, I've used GitHub. </p><p>One disadvantage is that it doesn't have a mobile app so far (or a remote interface in general). On one hand, it's not a big issue for me, because my goals for notes require a big screen and a nice keyboard. In practice, I still like to have access to my notes even on the go, so I just use an Android Git client with a Markdown editor. Maybe one day I'll change this to expose my notes as a static website. </p><h2 id="my-note-taking-workflow">My note taking workflow</h2><p>My workflow is inspired by (but only inspired, not fully copied from) the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125?gi=635ef2e210e3">Zettelkasten</a> method of Niklas Luhman, which is the trending note taking framework du jour, sprinkled with ideas from <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb">Tiago Forte</a> and others. When my note-taking workflow grows up, it wants to be like <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be">Andy Matuschak's notes</a>. </p><p>I have a loose categorization of my notes into folders. I'm not very strict about them and I don't want to spend much time organizing a hierarchy. Some notes also have tags (simply words prefixed with # and Obsidian is smart enough to start a search for them if you click on one). </p><p>Many of my notes don't start their life in Obsidian, but in my bullet journal. When I hear something new, or I read something interesting, often my bullet journal is closer to me, so I jot down the main ideas there. Then, when I get to my computer and I have time I copy it into Obsidian and I flesh out the ideas fully. Then I try to find any other notes that are relevant and add connections to them. </p><p>One thing that I try to do is to make my notes my own. This means that if I read an interesting article, I don't just copy paste the interesting parts, but I actually reword them and write them down as I understood them. This helps both comprehension and retention. </p><p>For certain topics, I create index maps, where I list all the notes that I have related to that topic. So notes belong to multiple index maps, because they are relevant in different areas. </p><p>As I add new notes and create connections between them, I end up revisiting old notes and updating them. Sometimes it's with a negative update (it didn't pan out, it was a wrong idea), but sometimes it's a positive one (a further development or something similar someone else has done). </p><p>The most interesting part is when notes from very different areas start to "touch" each other. Because of the graph view, it's easy to see how close notes are to each other. I also use the graph view to see what notes are isolated and then I try to find them a place. As you can see in the above screenshot, I still have a lot of work to do. </p><p>So far I have added 160 notes in Obsidian, so it's a small knowledge base. I still have many notes in Google Keep to move over. But I feel like Obsidian has already helped me (I feel on top of my notes) and I hope something nice (and useful) will come out of it. </p><p>Top photo by <a href="https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#/media/Bild:Obszidi%C3%A1n(Vezuv)005.jpg">Pogány Péter - Egen Wark</a>.</p><p><em>I’m publishing this as part of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> - Day 31.</em></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>

compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</span>
<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>twice</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.c         <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> my-code.o
<span># build the unsafe library to C with emcc</span>
<span>$ </span>emcc unsafe-lib.c          <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> unsafe-lib.wasm <span>-s</span> WASM2C <span>--no-entry</span>
<span># build the unsafe …</span></code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

And by both measures, the numbers are dramatically lower.</p>  <p>Births considered very premature —&nbsp;born at fewer than 29 to 32 weeks&nbsp;— have&nbsp;dropped by&nbsp;34&nbsp;to 40 per cent, he said.</p>  <p>"If we use their gestational age and if we are talking about the very earliest preemies,"&nbsp;Alshaikh&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>"That's kind of dramatic, actually, and surprising for us."</p>  <p>The numbers are even more dramatic for babies under one kilogram.</p>  <p>"If we used birth weight, those babies born less than one kilo, the number was actually very low and half of what we used to see in the last few years, during the same period of time of the year."</p>    <p>Alshaikh said the trend is very unusual.</p>  <p>"Soon after the lockdown in mid-March, we started to see fewer babies coming to our unit and to intensive care units, and these numbers of preemies were also low in April and mid-May," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So by that time, by late May, we felt like we needed to look at the numbers, and see where we are. And also at that time we started hearing that other hospitals, in Ireland and Denmark, have also noticed the drop down in the number of preemies."</p>  <p>When Calgary doctors took a good look at the numbers and compared them to the same time last year, it was an eyeopener.</p>  <p>"We were surprised," Alshaikh said. "We saw that our number is way lower than what we used to see during this period of time."</p>  <p>There are three main causes that doctors are looking at.</p>  <p>One is social distancing, which may have cut down on the amount of general infection from contact with others.</p>  <p>Another is less air pollution, from fewer cars being on the roads.</p>  <p>"This might actually help because studies in the past showed that air pollution actually increases the risk for preterm birth," Alshaikh said.</p>  <p>And simply not going out to work — resting — may be a final key.</p>  <p>"By staying home, a pregnant woman may have less stress from commuting and from work,&nbsp; and that might have helped them," Alshaikh said, adding it's too soon to know for sure which of these lockdown-related factors have contributed the most.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/premature-babies.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/premature-babies.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/premature-babies.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/premature-babies.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Calgary doctors who noticed a reduced number of premature births during the pandemic lockdown, are seeing those numbers rise again as restrictions have eased.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Jim Lynch, Flickr cc)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>&nbsp;"We see sometimes variation during the year, but it's not to the degree that we see fewer babies," Alshaikh said. "And the fact that we see the same trend in Ireland, in Denmark in Australia, it's kind of surprising for everyone working in this field."</p>  <p>Preterm birth comes with a host of challenges for the babies and their parents.</p>  <p>"The risk is high on children and their families, and also medical care resources," Alshaikh said. "For children, the risk increases for vision and hearing problems, and also for learning disability. It's higher even as the gestational age goes down. For example,&nbsp; 24 weeks is at very high risk compared to babies born at 28 weeks gestation or at 32 weeks gestation."</p>  <h2>Doctors teaming up to study</h2>  <p>The Calgary doctors will continue to study the phenomenon, which could hold clues to reducing preterm births in general.</p>  <p>For now, Alshaikh said it's too early to provide any specific advice to pregnant woman — other than to avoid stress, try to rest at home, get a lot of sleep&nbsp;and focus on good nutrition.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We've teamed up, actually, with the teams across the world, in Ireland and also in Denmark, and there is also a group in Manitoba working on this project, and we are hoping to understand more the ways to prevent the preterm birth, and also like to see if we can understand more on risk factors that are affecting preterm birth," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the Calgary doctor said there is one alarming development already —&nbsp;as the lockdown restriction ease, those preterm birth numbers are already on the rise again.</p>  <p>"We are actually noticing, even in Calgary, that when the restrictions started to be eased, the number of preterm babies coming to our unit and intensive care is going up again, which is quite actually interesting for us," Alshaikh said.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a><a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>This document is a gentle introduction to the double-entry counting method, as written from the perspective of a computer scientist. It is an attempt to explain basic bookkeeping using as simple an approach as possible, doing away with some of the idiosyncrasies normally involved in accounting. It is also representative of how <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/"><span>Beancount</span></a> works, and it should be useful to all users of <a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/"><span>plain-text accounting</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that I am not an accountant, and in the process of writing this document I may have used terminology that is slightly different or unusual to that which is taught in perhaps more traditional training in accounting. I granted myself license to create something new and perhaps even unusual in order to explain those ideas as simply and clearly as possible to someone unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>I believe that the method of double-entry counting should be taught to everyone at the high school level everywhere as it is a tremendously useful organizational skill, and I hope that this text can help spread its knowledge beyond professional circles.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping">Basics of Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The double-entry system is just a simple <em>method of counting</em>, with some simple rules.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by defining the notion of an <strong>account</strong>. An account is something that can contain things, like a bag. It is used to count things, to accumulate things. Let’s draw a horizontal arrow to visually represent the evolving contents of an account over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5b1da6643866c557b2a5ce687e70ee1db16b14de.png"></p>
<p>On the left, we have the past, and to the right, increasing time: the present, the future, etc.</p>
<p>For now, let’s assume that accounts can contain only one kind of thing, for example, <em>dollars</em>. All accounts begin with an empty content of zero dollars. We will call the number of units in the account the <strong>balance</strong> of an account. Note that it represents its contents at a particular point in time. I will draw the balance using a number above the account’s timeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/842dcb36da9e0e70c35d1023d65d8a571062baf0.png"></p>
<p>The contents of accounts can change over time. In order to change the content of an account, we have to add something to it. We will call this addition a <strong>posting</strong> to an account, and I will draw this change as a circled number on the account’s timeline, for example, adding $100 to the account:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5e5e7897a346355eccd4d21ec9485c3464a2d996.png"></p>
<p>Now, we can draw the updated balance of the account after the posting with another little number right after it:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/0c8a78dac61ae7fddde25761f036e7f379cad247.png"></p>
<p>The account’s balance, after adding $100, is now $100.</p>
<p>We can also remove from the contents of an account. For example, we could remove $25, and the resulting account balance is now $75:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/98e314125325ecc72262a73a21b74db3200414fd.png"></p>
<p>Account balances can also become <em>negative</em>, if we remove more dollars than there are in the account. For example, if we remove $200 from this account, the balance now becomes $-125:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/bdc8a23347040de123e3359a7c8f0cc253c6d7d2.png"></p>
<p>It’s perfectly fine for accounts to contain a negative balance number. Remember that all we’re doing is counting things. As we will see shortly, some accounts will remain with a negative balance for most of their timeline.</p>

<p>Something worthy of notice is how the timeline notation I’ve written in the previous section is analogous to paper account statements institutions maintain for each client and which you typically receive through the mail:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Amount</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>-25.00</td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>-200.00</td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Sometimes the amount column is split into two, one showing the positive amounts and the other the negative ones:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Debit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Credit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td></td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>25.00</td><td></td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>200.00</td><td></td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Here, “debit” means “removed from your account” and “credit” means “deposited in your account.” Sometimes the words “withdrawals” and “deposits” will be used. It all depends on context: for checking and savings accounts it is usual to have both types of postings, but for a credit card account typically it shows only positive numbers and then the occasional monthly payment so the single column format is used.</p>
<p>In any case, the “balance” column always shows the resulting balance <em>after</em> the amount has been posted to the account. And sometimes the statements are rendered in decreasing order of time.</p>
<h3 id="single-entry-bookkeeping">Single-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="single-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#single-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In this story, this account belongs to someone. We’ll call this person the <strong>owner</strong> of the account. The account can be used to represent a real world account, for example, imagine that we use it to represent the content of the owner’s checking account at a bank. So we’re going to label the account by giving it a name, in this case “Checking”:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/380ec8fea9ee9069411a61ccabcc838de44042ef.png"></p>
<p>Imagine that at some point, this account has a balance of $1000, like I’ve drawn on the picture. Now, if the owner spends $79 of this account, we would represent it like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b24d8c1e40edf6fd7e9d768ba8f0df279cd41f0e.png"></p>
<p>Furthermore, if the expense was for a meal at a restaurant, we could flag the posting with a <strong>category</strong> to indicate what the change was used for. Let’s say, “Restaurant”, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/7ee843cd9b997a9447bb022d7d35121a820e296d.png"></p>
<p>Now, if we have a lot of these, we could write a computer program to accumulate all the changes for each category and calculate the sums for each of them. That would tell us how much we spent in restaurants in total, for example. This is called the <strong>single-entry method</strong> of accounting.</p>
<p>But we’re not going to do it this way; we have a better way. Bear with me for a few more sections.</p>
<h3 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>An owner may have multiple accounts. I will represent this by drawing many similar account timelines on the same graphic. As before, these are labeled with unique names. Let’s assume that the owner has the same “Checking” account as previously, but now also a <strong>“</strong>Restaurant<strong>”</strong> account as well, which can be used to accumulate all food expenses at restaurants. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/3c380375442a643877c59660832bd7df6192e9cb.png"></p>
<p>Now, instead of <em>categorizing</em> the posting to a “restaurant category” as we did previously, we could create a matching posting on the “Restaurant” account to record how much we spent for food, with the amount spent ($79):</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b86a7242b92effc613f88bc0cc70381d72e774f0.png"></p>
<p>The “Restaurant” account, like all other accounts, also has an accumulated balance, so we can find out how much we spent in “Restaurant” in total. This is entirely symmetrical to counting changes in a checking account.</p>
<p>Now, we can associate the two postings together, by creating a kind of “parent” box that refers to both of them. We will call this object a <strong>transaction</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b77efafcf2d6a6f1afbfb13da70be2f892b339b4.png"></p>
<p>Notice here that we’ve also associated a description to this transaction: “Dinner at Uncle Boons”. A transaction also has a <strong>date</strong>, and all of its postings are recorded to occur on that date. We call this the transaction date.</p>
<p>We can now introduce the fundamental rule of double-entry bookkeeping system:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of all the postings of a transaction must equal zero.
</code></pre>
<p>Remember this, as this is the foundation of the double-entry method, and its most important characteristic. It has important consequences which I will discuss later in this document.</p>
<p>In our example, we remove $79 from the “Checking” account and “give it” to the “Restaurant” account. ($79) + ($-79) = $0. To emphasize this, I could draw a little summation line under the postings of the transaction, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b4182b9f64113868123cbcec20d468ab18b2786f.png"></p>
<h3 id="many-accounts">Many Accounts<a id="many-accounts"></a><a href="#many-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There may be many such transactions, over many different accounts. For example, if the owner of the accounts had a lunch the next day which she paid using a credit card, it could be represented by creating a “Credit Card” account dedicated to tracking the real world credit card balance, and with a corresponding transaction:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/f85a66510ce2e3bb614edca76463a9c4752a7d26.png"></p>
<p>In this example, the owner spent $35 at a restaurant called “Eataly.” The previous balance of the owner’s credit card was $-450; after the expense, the new balance is $-485.</p>
<p>For each real world account, the owner can create a bookkeeping account like we did. Also, for each category of expenditure, the owner also creates a bookkeeping account. In this system, there are no limits to how many accounts can be created.</p>
<p>Note that the balance in the example is a negative number; this is not an error. Balances for credit card accounts are normally negative: they represent an amount <em>you owe</em>, that the bank is lending you <em>on credit</em>. When your credit card company keeps track of your expenses, they write out your statement from their perspective, as positive numbers. For you, those are amounts you need to eventually pay. But here, in our accounting system, we’re representing numbers from the owner’s point-of-view, and from her perspective, this is money she owes, not something she has. What we have is a meal sitting in our stomach (a positive number of $ of “Restaurant”).</p>
<h3 id="multiple-postings">Multiple Postings<a id="multiple-postings"></a><a href="#multiple-postings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, transactions may have more than two postings; in fact, they may have any number of postings. The only thing that matters is that the sum of their amounts is zero (from the rule of double-entry bookkeeping above).</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at what would happen if the owner gets her salary paid for December:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/18980f41275676c5c7cf3b39dd256512bb45b78b.png"></p>
<p>Her gross salary received in this example is recorded as $-2,905 (I’ll explain the sign in a moment). $905 is set aside for taxes. Her “net” salary of $2,000, the remainder, is deposited in her “Checking” account and the resulting balance of that account is $2,921 (the previous balance of $921 + $2,000 = $2,921). This transaction has three postings: (+2,000) + (-2,905) + (+905) = 0. The double-entry rule is respected.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask: Why is her salary recorded as a negative number? The reasoning here is similar to that of the credit card above, though perhaps a bit more subtle. These accounts exist to track all the amounts from the owner’s point-of-view. The owner gives out work, and receives money and taxes in exchange for it …</p></div></div></div>

    <h2 id="internally">Internally</h2>
<p>I’ve managed a few small teams, and the worst situations always happen when I avoid conflict early.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if Sam does 3 problematic things, I might only address 2 of them. Maybe I don’t want Sam to think I’m mean, or maybe I need Sam to stay encouraged. Regardless of my intent, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to address that 3rd behavior, and increasingly burdensome to spin my wheels serving as an unnecessary intermediary in Sam’s interactions, trying to create a buffer between that 3rd behavior and the rest of the office. This is obviously stupid and unsustainable, and becomes more awkward to correct over time.</p>
<p>This often creeps up in more subtle ways. A developer might provide a lot of critical feedback on every new round of designs. I want the designer to feel empowered and trusted, but I also want the developer to care about the overall product. It’s perfectly possible to strike a good balance &amp; accurately communicate with everybody… However, it’s human-instinct to optimize each message for the receiver, and to sliiiightly oversell the degree to which I agree with the developer’s criticisms, or to soften those same criticisms when speaking with the designer. These little tweaks, which feel like hard work &amp; good management in the short-term, can really snowball over time.</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/expectations.jpg" alt="A graph with time on the X axis and reckoning on the Y axis. It demonstrates that for any initial degree of misunderstanding, the expectations deviate further from reality until it is corrected."></p><p>To minimize the magnitude of reckoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good manager will force the reckoning sooner</li>
<li>A great manager will avoid the misalignment in the first place</li>
<li>An excellent manager will avoid this misalignment without making anyone feel bad</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="externally">Externally</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many people believe that the role of a great recruiter (or salesperson, marketer, director, or anybody) is to actually increase the degree of misalignment in the above graph… In other words, that they should oversell. In a large enough company, someone else downstream will have to deal with the reckoning:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/before.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters tell the truth, but 1 evil recruiter lies and is rewarded for it."></p><p>If this incentive system goes unchecked, it quickly devolves into a situation where everybody knows that everybody oversells, and so the common wisdom is to mentally discount any promise made by a salesperson, recruiter, marketer, engineer, or really anybody:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/after.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters lie, but the candidates all adjust their expectations accordingly. This causes the truthful recruiters to suffer, because their truth is also discounted."></p><p>I’ve noticed that a lot of mentorship involves helping newcomers recognize the overselling for themselves &amp; learn to navigate these worlds of semi-truths &amp; complex incentives. I’ve also noticed that this flavor of BS is always bad for the overall system / company / marketplace / world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Externally, this pattern is unavoidable. Free markets will always be susceptible to some assumed misalignment, although regulations can help.</p>
<p>Within a company, however, this behavior is toxic. Whenever I see a team sugar-coating metrics, I know that it won’t be fun to work in implementation at that company. When the rubber meets the road, the fingers will start pointing.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<p>Here are some other things that I did to make myself miserable as a new manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the confidence to make hard decisions, and offloading them to someone more confident but less informed</li>
<li>Waiting waaaay too long to fire people</li>
<li>Reading a lot of books on management, and expecting <em>my</em> manager to immediately live the ideals of those specific books</li>
<li>Trying to manage former peers without intentionally, drastically resetting the relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>I can avoid most of these by constantly asking myself what issues I’m avoiding today, and pursuing the ones that might turn into big issues later.</p>

<p>The humble Casio F91W has been an iconic watch since it was first made in Japan back in 1989. Upon its release, it was sold for around $20 making it one of the world’s first affordable digital watches. Today, Casio still produces over 3 million of the F91W every year. The prevalence of this iconic timepiece through the years means it’s likely you’ve worn one at some point. If you have, then it’s probably the only thing you have in common with Osama bin Laden, Chechen militants, and Napoleon Dynamite. Congratulations!</p>



<p>As a kid in school, I personally remember being told off for talking in the back of the class. I had been caught excitedly telling my friends that I had just figured out what kind of watch the most wanted man on earth, Osama bin Laden, wears. As punishment, I was called up to answer the maths question on the board, at which I failed miserably. <em>”You need to focus on what matters! You can’t solve maths problems but you can tell everyone about the watches worn by terrorists?”</em> screamed my teacher. <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/about-reaper-feed/">Looking back</a>, I feel I prioritized the right kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>The Casio F91W was designed by Ryusuke Moriai which he described as “small, flat and simple”. The watch features a seven-segment numerical display on a grey LCD screen. Water-resistant, extremely durable and accurate to within 30 seconds a month, it’s a tried and tested piece of kit.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that’s to be said for international terrorists, they know a thing or two about choosing reliable products for waging war. The F-91W joined the ranks of other terrorist accessories like the Kalashnikov and the Toyota technical because it’s cheap, solid, and reliable. Oh, and it also doubles as a bombmaking accessory which we’ll look into later.</p>



<h3><strong><em>A Terrorist Fashion Icon</em></strong></h3>



<p>Whilst Casio has advanced further into combat watches through its iconic Casio G-Shock range, the F91W has remained the true battlefield accessory throughout modern warfare. Aside from iconic weapons, the Casio F-91W is the only branded accessory that Osama bin Laden was ever seen wearing in the open. Al-Qaeda was reported to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/prisoner/720.html">hand the watches out to recruits</a> at their terror training camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thus, it was al-Qaeda and bin Laden who arguably started the terrorist trend surrounding the watch.</p>

<p>During the height of the War on Terror, it didn’t take long for the US government to spot the prevalence of the Casio F91W amongst terrorists. In 2011, Wikileaks released a document labeled the “Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants” which was intended to assist staff at Guantanamo decide which detainees are more likely to carry out suicide attacks. According to the document, owning an F-91W was the biggest giveaway of a serious terror suspect alongside ownership of a satellite phone, a radio transceiver, or large quantities of cash.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t just paranoia. Statistics in other similar documents released by Wikileaks revealed that around a third of inmates being held at Guantanamo that were captured whilst wearing an F-91W had a known correlation with explosives. The F-91W watch came up almost 150 times in the piles of leaked <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/ym/us9ym-000840dp.pdf">Guantanamo prisoner assessments</a>. Ironically, four of the chaplains who worked at Guantanimo Bay also wore the watch.</p>

<p>One of the detainees at Guantanamo was grilled over the prevalence of the watch amongst suspected terrorists. He claimed that the water-resistant feature of the F91W watch was handy due to the Islamic requirement for followers to wash up to their elbows before prayers. Innocent enough explanation, right? Well not really. Interrogators smelled a rat when another prisoner claimed the prevalence of the watch amongst Jihadi inmates was simply due to the built-in compass that helped them pray towards Mecca. However, there is no compass in the F91W.</p>



<p>Despite the fairly frosty relationship between the two, ISIS didn’t let it get in between their choice of a good wristwatch. The F-91W was a feature of various ISIS militants including Tunisian born Tariq al-Harzi who was a high ranking Emir of the Islamic State. It was also worn by Kevin Chassin who was a French-born Jihadist who went to Syria to join ISIS. He was subsequently utilized for his high propaganda value in ISIS videos. </p>

<p>However, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi wasn’t so fond of the cheap Casio F91W. Instead, al-Baghdadi opted for a flashy watch that sparked debate over the exact model. The watch was spotted during his infamous speech in Mosul that declared the formation of the so-called Caliphate. It was believed to be either a Rolex or an Omega Seamaster, both of which run north of $3,000 and contradict the contents of his speech as well as his ideals.</p>



<p>It’s not just Jihadist terrorist groups that wear the watch. Introducing Subcomandante Marcos who, until recently, led the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Mexico. The photogenic insurgent leader was pictured in an iconic photo on horseback while smoking a pipe and wearing, you guessed it! </p>

<p>Of course, the watch is not only appreciated by the terrorists of the world but likewise by the people who combat them. Various fighting forces across the Middle East have been seen using the watch. Such as the Syrian Democratic Forces which is a coalition waging an anti-ISIS campaign across war-torn Syria.</p>



<h3><em><strong> How the Casio F91W Became a Bomb Makers Accessory</strong></em></h3>



<p>The Casio F91W is not only the terrorist’s timepiece of choice due to its ruggedness and reliability. Due to its long-lead timer, it also doubles as a bomb-making accessory for various terror groups around the world from Afghanistan to Chechnya. Deadly usage of the watch has been well documented through various case studies.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=696%2C500&amp;ssl=1" alt="Casio FW91" width="696" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=585%2C420&amp;ssl=1 585w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>According to US intelligence officials, the watch doubles as a bomb timer as its alarm can be set beyond a 24-hour period. During the War on Terror, Pakistani ISI officials found more than 600 of the watches in a terrorist safe house in Karachi which led to a period of anybody being found wearing an F91W watch to be liable for arrest and questioning. However, with the watch being available for $4 dollars on Pakistani markets, simply possessing a Casio watch doesn’t prove anything and this tactic of arrest was soon dropped.</p>



<p>In September 1999, a series of bombs were detonated inside four Russian apartment buildings in the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buinaksk. The blasts killed 367 people and injured over 1,000 others. Russian investigators concluded that the attackers had been trained in terror camps being run by Ibn al-Khattab inside Chechnya which had recently gained unstable independence following the First Chechen War.</p>

<p>Investigations carried out inside Chechnya discovered that the bombs used in the attacks were comprised of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder, with plastic serving as an intermediate explosive. The detonator? A combination of a Krona battery and a Casio F-91W. </p>



<blockquote><p>“about a third of inmates at JTF-GTMO [the unit in charge of Guantanamo] who were captured wearing one of these watches had a known correlation with explosives”.</p><cite>– Prisoner evaluation sheet from Guantanamo.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 1994, an al-Qaeda militant named Ramzi Yousef used the Casio F-91W as a 4-hour timer on the bomb he constructed in an airplane toilet of Philippine Airlines Flight 434. He proceeded to leave his deadly work under the seat before leaving the plane. It detonated on the next flight, killing a Japanese businessman named Haruki Ikegami who sat in Yousef’s seat. Thankfully, the bomb’s orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami. Thus other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.</p>



<p>So, to round off this article I feel it’s fitting to make a comparison between Ryusuke Moriai and Mikhail Kalashnikov. Just like when Kalashnikov designed the AK47 intended solely for the defense of his motherland, the innovative inventor Ryusuke Moriai could never have predicted that his creation would go on an unstoppable path of its own and be used for far more sinister purposes than ever intended. Mr. Moriai had unwittingly created a watch ideal for modern warfare.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a profound statement from Casio on the watch being used for deadly means by some pretty evil people. I was looking for something similar to what Kalashnikov said about the violent impact of his life’s work. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/28/casio-f-91w-watch-design-hipsters-al-qaida">The Guardian</a> approached the PR department for Casio hoping for a similar statement on the widespread use of the F-91W amongst global terrorists. But they just received a blunt email stating: “Casio is not making any further comment on the F-91W watch at this point in time.” Damn.</p>
