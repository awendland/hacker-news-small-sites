<p>A Universal Basic Income (UBI) would improve everyone’s lives, increase our free time, empower workers, and ensure everyone has food and a roof over their head. These are noble goals, but obviously there’s a downside or it would already be implemented, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if a UBI wasn’t just a noble thing to do, but the best thing to kick-start the economy and explode GDP growth to previously unseen levels? I believe UBI is capitalism 2.0 and today I’m going to show you why.</p>



<h2>Why does capitalism work so well?</h2>



<p>Even the most hardcore anti-capitalists have to give respect to how the combination of capitalism and technology has worked to lift most of the world out poverty and provided us with the security and comfort only kings enjoyed just a few century’s ago.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of capitalism and free trade, as laid out in Adam Smith’s genre defining book <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZMJGZG">The Wealth of Nations</a>. The first core component of capitalism is the understanding that when everyone performs the work they are best at, then trades with each other, everyone wins.</p>



<p>The second core component of capitalism is the more accurate information you have, the better economic decisions you make. Free-Market Capitalism has always outperformed top down economic control because those at the top can’t manage all the information about the economy, such as who is best at what, and where the most efficient areas to allocate resources are. When everyone learns about and optimizes their own section of the economy, much more wealth is generated than if they were told what to do by some central government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capitalism accelerated in the 18th Century with Industrialization. We became more efficient at turning raw goods into useful products, which generated more wealth. The increased supply of goods caused their prices to lower so everyone could afford more stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19th century the age of Nationalism began. Legal corporations were invented, and big corporations began building train lines, ships, and started digging for oil and coal. Our overall energy production and connectivity increased, which created more wealth as more people could work together, with every person specializing in what they were good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century we started the Globalization experiment. Ship’s became more massive than ever which lowered the costs to shipping anywhere in the world. Governments also started becoming more cooperative. Because we all become wealthier when goods are produced by those most efficient at making them, eventually goods started to be produced in low income countries. The income of those living in developing nations went up, and those in the developed world received cheaper goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late 20th century and early 21st century we started on the Automation experiment. This is still in its infancy but will eventually be a complete revolution of capitalism as big as the industrial age first was.</p>



<p>Strangely, even though we’re in a golden age of hyper-efficient production and trade, the overall GDP growth of the USA is slowing. This is happening because we’re reaching the end of the current stage of capitalism and need a new paradigm for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Winner take all economics</h2>



<p>A core feature of capitalism is when people are given freedom of choice in their spending, they want the best value goods they can get.</p>



<p>Imagine an 18th century town with two widget makers, one of whom makes significantly better and/or cheaper widgets than the other. Once the townsfolk realize this, the shop with the superior product would gain all their business causing the other company to go bankrupt.</p>



<p>As capitalism went national in the 19th century, it was no longer good enough to be the best widget producer in your local town. Now you had to compete against the other widget producers in your state or country. Over time, people learned who made the best value widgets and took their business there, even if the producer lived hundreds of miles away. If that widget maker could keep up with demand, they may eventually own the majority of the market. Instead of putting one competitor out of business, as per the 18th century town, they could potentially bankrupt thousands of other companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market got bigger, the rewards for winning were greater. The best widget producers of the 19th century made significantly more wealth than the best in the 18th century, even if they took over less of the market.</p>



<figure><img src="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png 664w, https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px"></figure>



<p>This is why wealth inequality soared when capitalism went global in the 20th century. Potential markets grew to astronomical size, with huge rewards for the victors. As companies became more efficient they could take over entire global markets and produce their goods in the cheapest, most efficient location possible. This led to massive accumulations of wealth and the biggest wealth gap in history.</p>



<p>This in itself isn’t a bad thing. After all, we’ve all become wealthier in the last few centuries even if some have become unimaginably wealthy. But what happens if most of the money accrues to the top of society? It leads to lack of demand for the widgets being produced, because those at the bottom don’t have enough wealth to purchase them.</p>



<p>There’s a common economic theory called “supply-side economics”. The core belief is that if you allow companies to compete and optimize, they will drive down the cost of products which will allow consumers to purchase more, which stimulates GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now supply-side economics makes sense, and products have become cheaper over time. However you always reach a point of diminishing returns where you’d have to spend vast amounts of money to make your product only a fraction of a percent cheaper, and thus it’s not worth the investment. When a company starts to reach this equilibrium they cannot lower the price enough to gain enough new customers and they start to become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is demand-constrained it can keep up with orders from customers, and produce as many products as they desire without needing to add additional production capacity. As we’ve had so much competition, automation and globalization in the 20th century, most consumer goods companies have now reached equilibrium and become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When demand-constrained, they need to increase demand for their product in order to make more money. They do this via advertising. We can see that more and more companies are becoming demand constrained because their advertising budgets increase every year:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/biWhrntU11ercokAXrnHp2bykerAyyfyRlBIJ8gFV1yWuxk4ULbk9uXRMwpaFevP8aaqahbm2OBmcE45klv4aO4OzH66qRe3ZAn4BDi6_F0iD0CGDBGfkx4AHn4A0SvHZq7Hr36q" alt=""></figure>



<p>The thing is, <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-Paycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-CareerBuilder-Survey">consumers in the bottom 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck</a>, they already spend everything they have each month.They’re not holding back additional money, waiting for the right product to appear. Which means all this advertising is creating little additional growth and wealth, it’s just taking it from other companies.</p>



<p>So we’ve got the supply, we have enough products, and people are spending as much as they can on the products out there. We’ve reached economic equilibrium, and as a consequence of this, growth stagnates:</p>



<h4>United States GDP Annual Growth Rate 1948-2020</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUe4AvpQOvE9jXyS-4Y_NOvC1E7KYGK696zpAbt4Q-yQEPNZHovBKLSXuJZu2U4XpcEOVHLB-IuLKNHTFPhz9ln3dFrW1Jc2-7pewC-eZ-XZJMVs5P9MzC2VW8RJ8UFjqRvuqxpl" alt=""></figure>



<p>Instead of continually trying to optimize supply, with diminishing returns, we need to optimize demand by giving consumers more money to spend on things they desire.</p>



<p>If we can give companies overwhelming demand so they have to scale up production instead of spending all their money on advertising, we can have both happy companies making profit hand over fist, and happy consumers who get everything they desire.</p>



<p><strong>To reverse this trend of stagnating growth, we must put more capital in the hands of lower income consumers, who will then spend it on things they desire and increase GDP.</strong></p>



<h2>The Solutions</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to increase capital at the bottom of the wealth pyramid. Most of them involve attempting to revert to some past state of society. Only one of them fully embraces capitalism and all its strengths and extends it into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first solution is some form of nationalism, where countries enact tariffs and attempt to bring all production back to the country instead of producing it overseas. This will create higher paying jobs for those whose work was previously outsourced to cheaper countries. However, this creates less wealth overall as work is no longer given to where it’s done most efficiently. This breaks the primary component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second solution is some sort of socialism, where the government introduces new laws and systems to redirect money to attempt to balance the system manually. This will help, but creates less wealth overall as the government must make many decisions with limited information. There is no way the government can make spending decisions for millions of people, and have those decisions be better than what those people could make on their own. Thus this is less efficient and goes against the second core component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third solution is a Universal Basic Income, where countries distribute some wealth to all residents equally. This keeps both the first and second core components of capitalism intact. Jobs are done in the most efficient locations and those deciding where money should be spent are the ones with the most information. As jobs are displaced no one is left without an income source and the bottom of the income pyramid has enough to keep consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth solution is to ignore this and hope for the best. If history is any guide we’ll either get economic stagnation for decades, or those at the bottom of the wealth pyramid will get so mad it leads to violent revolution. So it’s best we avoid this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Obvious Next Step</strong></p>



<p>It’s clear we’ve stepped into a new world of rapidly increasing wealth, but growth is slowing down because of the effects of globalization and automation. We’re now faced with a few choices. Most of these choices will undo progress and take us back to a …</p></section></article></div></div>

		<p>Wireheads are beings who have changed their reward architecture in order to&nbsp;be happy all the time. Unfortunately few people are making a serious effort to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/85h/better_disagreement/" target="_blank">steel man</a> the <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/wirehead/index.html" target="_blank">case for wireheading</a>.&nbsp;The concept of wireheading tends to be&nbsp;a conversation stopper, and is frequently used as a reductio-ad-absurdum for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.valence-utilitarianism.com/" target="_blank">valence utilitarianism</a>. Hedonism is a low-status philosophy at the time, but this may be the result of&nbsp;what amounts to&nbsp;<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/">dumb reasons</a>&nbsp;(i.e. going against&nbsp;it signals&nbsp;intellectual sophistications). Let’s be meta-contrarian for a moment&nbsp;and think&nbsp;critically about it. What would a good case for wireheading look like? In what follows I will (1) provide an account of what is known about emotional&nbsp;dynamics over time, (2) discuss the known pitfalls of current wireheading methods, (3) propose a system&nbsp;to overcome these pitfalls, and (4) make the case that combining wireheading (done right) with a systematic exploration of the state-space of consciousness&nbsp;might&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;be our saving grace against the perils of Darwinism at the evolutionary limit.</p>
<p>Let us begin by enriching our understanding&nbsp;of the nature of bliss and its temporal dynamics:</p>
<h2>The Cube of Euphoria</h2>
<p>A little over a year ago I conducted a study to figure out the main dimensions along which psychotropic&nbsp;drugs influence people. The&nbsp;<a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2015/06/09/state-space-of-drug-effects-results/" target="_blank">State-Space of Drug Effects</a>&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;six main dimensions: fast euphoria, slow euphoria, spiritual euphoria, clarity, perception of overall value, and external vs. internal source of interest. The first three&nbsp;dimensions are directly related to pleasure, which makes them relevant for our&nbsp;current discussion.</p>

<p>Fast euphoria is what you get when you take stimulants, exercise or&nbsp;anticipate that something great is about to happen. Slow euphoria is what you experience if you take&nbsp;opioids or&nbsp;depressants, receive&nbsp;massages or hug a loved&nbsp;one. Spiritual/philosophical euphoria changes less frequently relative to the daily comings and goings of the other two. It is a state of consciousness related to the way we represent “the big picture”. Those who seek it&nbsp;try to induce&nbsp;it by methods that include&nbsp;philosophical thinking, spiritual practices and/or psychedelic drug use.</p>
<p>Two out of these three dimensions are equivalent to the well-studied emotion classification space of valence and arousal (also called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529060" target="_blank">core affect</a>). Valence is <em>how good the experience feels</em>, whereas arousal deals with&nbsp;the intensity of the experience. It turns out that one can get the slow-fast projection of the cube of euphoria by changing the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis" target="_blank">basis used to represent</a>&nbsp;the valence-arousal space. You can get the valence-arousal space simply by rotating the slow-fast euphoria projection&nbsp;by 45&nbsp;degrees:</p>

<p>As we can see, fast euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence high-arousal” while slow euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence low-arousal”. This basis is not uncommon in affective psychology, and when used the axes&nbsp;are usually labeled&nbsp;“positive and negative activation”. We will use a&nbsp;yellow-red circle to represent fast euphoria and a blue-green circle to represent slow euphoria. I chose this&nbsp;color-coding by reasoning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">warm colors</a> are a better representation of ecstatic states of consciousness whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">cool colors</a> illustrate better the feelings of<em> cooling off</em> and relaxing. I happen to prefer the&nbsp;fast-slow basis because it highlights the different kinds of euphoria in a helpful way that captures behavioral differences. This will be important when we get to steel-manning wireheading later on.</p>
<h2>Formalizing the Hedonic Treadmill: Negative Feedback Mechanisms</h2>
<p>It is well known that in the long run the things that happen to you have a surprisingly small effect on&nbsp;your overall level of happiness. One tends to always orbit around one’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">hedonic set-point</a>&nbsp;</em>(our mean valence and arousal values). Although our average&nbsp;sense of wellbeing does change from context to context&nbsp;(in response to variables such as stress, novelty, drug regimens, accomplishments, and opportunities for meaningful relationships), the environmental&nbsp;effect usually washes out over time by one’s&nbsp;internal negative feedback mechanisms. The ability to&nbsp;achieve lasting happiness, it turns out, was not as evolutionarily adaptive in our ancestral environment as the robust re-centering of affective dynamics that ended up governing our patterns of wellbeing. Thankfully, though unfairly, we are not all equally miserable; some people are lucky to be born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymic_temperament" target="_blank">hyperthymic</a> and <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/08/03/information-sensitive-gradients-of-bliss/" target="_blank">enjoy life the majority of the time</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/pain-tolerance-has-genetic-basis-study-suggests-new-avenues-drug-treatment-277840" target="_blank">Genetically-determined pain-thresholds</a> do not only influence how one responds to physical discomfort, but also predict the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25267" target="_blank">size of one’s social network</a> (presumably by making social rejection less taxing).</p>
<p>Less well known is that people have different values for their valence-arousal correlation. According to a <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Kuppens2008IDIRB.pdf" target="_blank">2007 study by Peter Kuppens</a>, the conventional wisdom in affective psychology&nbsp;that valence and arousal are uncorrelated is not quite correct. For 30% of people valence is negatively correlated with arousal, for 30% it is the opposite and for the remaining 40% there is no correlation between these two dimensions.</p>
<p>This means that some people usually experience high valence (i.e. feel good) at the same time as being in an up-beat high energy state, and&nbsp;when they feel bad they tend to also have&nbsp;low levels of&nbsp;energy. On the other extreme there are those who&nbsp;experience bliss by tuning the energy&nbsp;down and relaxing, and primarily experience bad feelings in the form of high-energy states (such as irritation, worry and anger).</p>

<p>What else is variable across people? As it turns out, the transition patterns of core affect are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">personality factors</a>. People’s level of variance in the&nbsp;valence dimension is an important component&nbsp;of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism" target="_blank">neuroticism</a>. Although most neurotics tend to hang out&nbsp;in low-valence states, there are indeed very happy neurotics whose problem is not that they feel bad, but that great feelings are too short-lasting and unpredictable. It is the unpredictability of valence rather than its absolute value that&nbsp;results in the coping mechanisms typical of this dimension.&nbsp;Likewise, higher variability in arousal is a component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Temperamental_view" target="_blank">extraversion</a>, SEE I AM SCREAMING NOW (for example).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.testsonthenet.com/Factors-facets.htm#Openness%20to%20Experience" target="_blank">Openness to experience</a> can be understood in terms of novelty-triggered increases in valence, so that&nbsp;more open individuals are more likely to&nbsp;experience euphoria of all kinds when learning new information relative to&nbsp;people who describe themselves as conventional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness" target="_blank">Conscientious</a> individuals&nbsp;feel very rewarded when they complete a laborious task (but may experience more intense shame if they do not finish it on time). Agreeableness is undeniably connected to a positive perception of other people. If one feels that others are right and deserve to exist one is more likely to cooperate. The way to have positive perceptions of others is to <a href="https://www.mdma.net/" target="_blank">increase the hedonic tone of the interpersonal representations</a>.&nbsp;In brief, core affect dynamics can be used to capture otherwise hard-to-describe properties of the various personality factors. They each have a signature behavior in the valence-arousal space.</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~zoravecz/bayes/data/Articles/Oravecz2011AHLSD.pdf" target="_blank">A Hierarchical Latent Stochastic Differential Equation Model for&nbsp;Affective Dynamics</a>,&nbsp;Oravecz, Tuerlinckx, and Vandekerckhove applied the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" target="_blank">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a>&nbsp;to the dynamics of core affect. Their model takes into account many important features that had previously been overlooked for the sake of simplicity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, these features turn out to be important signatures of personality factors, so having a model that incorporates them may be very useful to understand the differences between people. Their model describes people as having: a latent <em>home base</em> (hedonic set point), variance (for both components), a correlation between valence and arousal, an average speed, and a time-dependent relocation of the&nbsp;home base&nbsp;determined by the hour of the day. The model allows you to&nbsp;estimate person-specific parameters (using as input a sequence of self-reported emotional states).&nbsp;In turn, once you have determined someone’s latent parameters, the model can help you predict their&nbsp;future affect&nbsp;based on their current state.</p>

<p>This model is perhaps as good as it gets&nbsp;if you are restricted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property" target="_blank">Markov assumption</a> and given only the&nbsp;valence and arousal dimensions of the participants over time. The state-space of emotion is far more granular, though. Even increasing the number of dimensions by one (e.g. by including the dimension of spiritual euphoria) may&nbsp;go a long way in clarifying the nature of unexpected emotional transitions. What explains the sometimes very large effect of&nbsp;philosophical discoveries, religious conversions, and personal epiphanies?</p>
<h2>A Map of Emotion Attractors: Studying 176X176 Transition Probabilities</h2>
<p>Back between 2012 to&nbsp;2014 I worked on modeling the dynamics of emotion transitions. I did this first&nbsp;as part of a research project&nbsp;for a company I worked for&nbsp;(thanks Kanjoya!) and it&nbsp;then transformed into the topic of&nbsp;my masters’ thesis. If you are interested in reading about it you can find some more&nbsp;<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/papers/conditioned-sentiment-expression.pdf" target="_blank">on a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;I wrote with colleagues</a>&nbsp;on predicting future emotions based on a sequence of previous ones (together with social cues).*</p>
<p>The analysis I worked on was made on a sample of hundreds of thousands of users of the now-defunct (<a href="http://www.experienceproject.com/stories/topics" target="_blank">but still browsable</a>) …</p></div></div>

These days I play more of an advisory than active role in writing programs, by running much of <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/">Cemetech</a> behind the scenes and providing the occasional input to others. I think calculators are an excellent way to introduce people to programming, since they are readily available devices and not too complex to get started on, while still having enough capability to support experienced developers in doing interesting things (because they are readily accessible embedded systems). I fully credit getting started with programming calculators for having ended up programming embedded systems profesionally.</p><figure><img src="https://www.taricorp.net/2020/introducing-tihle/calcdcc.jpg" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tim's workspace for
<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=262170#262170">CalcDCC</a>
looks like it could contain any embedded engineer's prototype.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the future of programming for TI calculators seems to be in peril. About a month ago, the news came out that new versions of the OS for the TI-84+ CE (the most recent variant of the 83+ featuring a color screen and improved eZ80 processor) <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news/2020/5/949/_/ti-removes-asmc-programming-from-ti-83-premium-ce">will remove support for running native code</a>.</p><h3 id="death-of-a-platform">Death of a platform</h3><p>While this doesn’t necessarily affect older calculators or programs, in the long
term it seems to spell doom for calculators as an inroad to developing embedded
software in particular. Programs written in the calculators’ dialect of BASIC
continue to be accessible and a new Python implementation fills the void
somewhat, but they lack in depth- where a user could spend time and effort
developing native programs constrained only by the hardware they run on before, in
the future users will be <strong>limited to only those capabilities provided by TI’s
software</strong>.</p><p>In much the same way that I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a> is a decent introduction to programming but completely hides interesting details and is not seriously used by anybody but those using it a learning tool, I also believe removal of support for running native code will ultimately mean people will no longer have calculators (which are often required school equipment!) as a useful entrypoint to serious programming.</p><h3 id="historical-interest">Historical interest</h3><p>In addition to the loss of a way to introduce people to programming, removing support for native code also effectively throws away a large existing library of programs that stretches back more than 20 years (nicely embodied in <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</a>, which first came online in 1996). While the 84+ CE is a young platform relative to the TI-83+ series as a whole (and is incompatible with earlier software), it already has a rich library of programs created by users that will effectively be lost when they can no longer be run on the hardware they are designed for.</p><figure><picture>

<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/1347">Tetric A</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The precedent of effectively <strong>destroying the work of community members</strong> is
troubling, and I am motivated to look for ways to preserve it. In much the same
way that there still exist thriving communities around long-obsolete home
computers like the <a href="https://apple2online.com/">Apple II</a> and <a href="https://thec64community.online/">Commodore
64</a> today, I think it’s worthwhile to try to
provide a similar opportunity by preserving the platform into a hostile future
by working to give the systems and software ongoing life beyond what their
creators envisioned (or perhaps more pointedly, beyond what they decided they
could make money from).</p><p>As a newer platform than those early home computers that still have active communities, information and resources may be rather easier to come by for these calculators because much of the information was born digital and has always been online. However this is also hazardous to preservation, because if items are readily available online there may not be any replacements available if the original goes away. For instance, TI used to <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/1/19/19421.html">freely provide an SDK for the 83+</a>, but have more recently made it <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/customer-support/sdk-request">much more difficult to access</a>. Perhaps even more concerningly, TI’s web site no longer seems to provide <em>any</em> information about the <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-84plus-cse.html">TI-84+ CSE</a>, seeming to deny that it ever existed (though manuals and software are still available if you know where to look).</p><h3 id="a-calling">A calling</h3><p>Recognizing these concerns about the loss of a valuable resource for beginning programmers and loss of interesting history to the grind of the education-industrial complex,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> what are we to do?</p><p>There exist a number of web sites that document the calculators and offer
resources related to them- I’m already involved in that, which is valuable and
<a href="https://archive.org/details/ticalc-2014-08">generally well-preserved</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/">the
Internet Archive</a>. But if the existing resources are
useless on current hardware as they largely become when large classes of
programs are not runnable, new tools become required: I believe this situation
calls for emulation of the calculators, to <strong>make the platform accessible to
everybody</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-state-of-the-art">The state of the art</h2><p>There already exist a number of emulators for TI calculators, including:</p><ul><li><a href="http://wabbitemu.org/">WabbitEmu</a>, which is open-source and generally good
quality.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/">jsTIfied</a>, an emulator
available as a web application.</li><li><a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html">Virtual TI</a>,
one of the earliest calculator emulators to be created.</li><li><a href="https://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=Emulators:PindurTI">PindurTI</a>,
which is now defunct but offered some useful capabilities in its day.</li><li>..and others</li></ul><p>While most of these are accurate enough to run most programs, this is not the
whole story: all of them <strong>require a ROM image to work</strong>. The ROM includes the
calculator’s operating system and boot code, which implement huge swaths of
functionality from keyboard and display handling through implementing
floating-point arithmetic and the TI-BASIC interpreter.</p><p>TI jealously protect their OS and boot code because from the point of view of
their business, the entire value of the calculator is in its software. If an
emulator can run the same software on a more general machine, what reason is
there for a user to purchase a $100 device from TI?<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> But if we want
to preserve <em>community</em> software for emulation, we don’t really care about the
same functions that TI are interested in protecting.</p><p>Though truly accurate emulation still requires all OS functions be available in
the same way, many applications only use a small subset of them. So what options
are available for emulating the system software?</p><h3 id="os-implementations">OS implementations</h3><ul><li>TI’s EOS (TI-OS) is provided with the calculator, and can be downloaded
from TI in order to update a calculator. However, they added a <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8819">clickwrap
agreement to the OS in
2013</a> that attempts
to forbid use of the OS for emulation. While that clause is questionably
enforceable, nobody (myself included) is very interested in challenging it-
mostly because TI has historically tended to turn a blind eye to the
distribution of ROMs. Any such distribution in a larger, more public forum
increases the risk of calling in the lawyers, so for these and the reasons
discussed above, I do not believe it is tenable to use TI’s OS for
general-availability emulation.</li><li>Brandon Wilson’s <a href="https://www.brandonw.net/calculators/OS2/">OS2</a> seems most
relevant, in that it wants to reimplement TI-OS “but better.” However,
it hasn’t been updated in 11 years at this point and seems dead. It’s also
dependent on the assembler and tools provided by Zilog, which only run on
Windows and are closed-source.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5686">GlassOS</a>
is implemented in C and actually seems useable, but lacks compatibility
with any existing software.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/KnightOS/KnightOS">KnightOS</a> is UNIX-like and seems to
have a selection of useful software, but again is not compatible with any
existing software beyond a small library of ports targeting it.</li><li>Many other people (myself included) have attempted to write OSes, but they
don’t merit mention here because they’re of even less practical use.</li></ul><h3 id="boot-code">Boot code</h3><p>While the calculator OS implements most functionality, the boot code is also
relevant- TI’s OS uses some support code from the boot code, and of course the
boot code is responsible for handling the system power-up sequence and allowing
recovery from a no-OS situation.</p><p>The boot code on these calculators is meant to be read-only,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and is
programmed into the device at the factory. Thus, there is no official source for
boot code short of reading it from the memory of a physical calculator and the
community consensus tends to be that sharing copies of the boot code would
infringe on TI’s copyright.</p><p><a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/72/7233.html">Ben “FloppusMaximus”
Moody</a> at one time
published a reimplementation of the calculator boot code called “BootFree,”
which seems to have disappeared from the Internet except for the version
integrated with WabbitEmu. While it seems BootFree disappeared for reasons
related to the addition of the clickwrap agreement to the EOS downloads provided
by TI,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> I don’t think the same
reasons apply to emulation of non-EOS software- thus, BootFree seems like a
fine resource in pursuit of making emulation available to all.</p><h2 id="design">Design</h2><p>If the goal is to freely emulate calculator programs, we recognize that while
the boot code situation seems compatible with accurate emulation, the current
available
<strong><em><abbr title="Software allowing anybody to use or modify it for any reason; Open Source.">libre</abbr></em>
OSes are insufficient</strong>. While it is technically feasible to
emulate TI’s EOS (the only reasonable choice for emulating the current software
library), legal forces make it untenable to use as a base for publicly-available
emulation with the goal of allowing anybody to run programs for the platform.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that there are two major divisions in kinds of programs
that run on these calculators: they can be implemented in the provided BASIC
dialect (TI-BASIC), or distributed as machine code for the …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[How to STOP everything being so critical and urgent]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  

  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/incident-management">here</a>.</p>

<p>At some point in a <em>Product Engineering</em> team you will be tired of every <a href="https://xkcd.com/1700/">bug</a> or issue being urgent and critical. This usually happens after dealing with several problems informed by late night Slack messages. At this point nobody really knows which issue is an urgent incident, which is worth waiting to the next morning and which isn’t even something worth solving. All this is harmful for the team’s culture and for the business itself. When everything becomes urgent, nothing is urgent and nobody cares anymore.</p>

<p>Unlike other processes, Incident Management doesn’t emerge naturally. It’s a defensive mechanism agains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdTMuivYF30">chaos</a>; it needs to be created and agreed on.</p>

<p>You can’t fix it all at once and you can’t do perfect from the beginning. But you need to start somewhere. This post is about how to go from having nothing related to Incidenct Management to having something.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p>You may feel the urge to adopt <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/">Pager Duty’s incident response process</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/handbook/incident-response">Atlassian’s Incident Management process</a>. Or even to use what’s in this post. Be careful. I’m writting what has worked for my team. Don’t just copy. You have a brain. Use it.</p>

<p>My team literally has all this written down in a Counfluence page. Writting it down is not enought. Everyone should agree to use it. You need to educate through workshops, talks and training sessions giving real life examples and making sure everybody understands the basic process you are about to set in place. Everybody must be on board.</p>

<p>First thing you probably need to address is everything being urgent and critial. For that you need to define what is really an <a href="https://xkcd.com/838/">incident</a> and a few severity levels. Give some real life examples and instructions on how to report each incident. Don’t worry if it isn’t perfect. With every incident you will adapt and iterate over it.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/alert.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-incident">What is an incident</h2>

<p>An incident is an event that causes disruption to a service or a reduction in the quality of a service which requires an emergency response.</p>

<p>That las part is important. Emergency response. An incident has such an impact that gives someone the right to disturb somebody else’s life.</p>

<h2 id="severity-levels">Severity levels</h2>

<p>When you detect an incident try to analyze the impact and apply a severity level. What is severity? The severity of an incident is derived based on the effect of that incident on the system. It indicates the level of threat and how can it affect the system.</p>

<h3 id="sev1">Sev1</h3>

<p>Critical incident that involves irreversible damage to the company or brand reputation, it must be solved instantly even if it means to take the site down. This should never happen.</p>

<p>Example: Security vulnerability exposing customer data, images showing violent content appear on the home page, customer accounts have been hacked.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Call the responsible Engineering Manager.</p>

<h3 id="sev2">Sev2</h3>

<p>Critical system incident actively impacting many customers’ ability to use the product. It is an incident which is a major blocker and has affected the functionality of the whole service. It affects the business as a whole.</p>

<p>Example: Showing big differences in prices, discounts that shouldn’t exist but apply to all the products, site down.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If nobody responds in 10 minutes, call the responsible Engineering Manager. The fix is to be deployed as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="sev3">Sev3</h3>

<p>Stability or minor customer-impacting incidents that require immediate attention from service owners. Priority number one for the team involved. It can be fixed the next morning.</p>

<p>Example: One category is not working. Emails are not being sent.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If it happens out of office time it could be fixed the next day.</p>

<h3 id="sev4">Sev4</h3>

<p>Minor issues, cosmetic issues or bugs, requiring action, but not affecting customer ability to use the product, must be prioritized.</p>

<p>Example: One customer didn’t receive a confirmation email. One customer bought an item without stock. The image of a product is not correct.</p>

<p>Typical response: Only in working hours. Talk to the Product Owner and Team Lead of the team responsible for the service/feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/bug_fixing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>An incident’s severity level can be upgraded if it is not solved in a resonable amount of time. If that happens, you’ll need to take more severe and drastic actions.</p>

<h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2>

<p>Keep calm. Don’t pressure anybody. People work and communicat poorly under pressure.</p>

<p>You don’t need to set up all the roles of a mature <em>Incident Management</em> process. The most important one that you do need is the <strong>Communications Manager</strong> or <strong>Communications Lead</strong>. Somebody will take this role during an incident. This person keeps everybody informed about the status of the situation. What has been detected, what is being investigated, what the team has found, timeframe for resolution, actions that are being taken, etc.</p>

<p>If updates are not communicated regularly people get nervious. Even a message like <em>“We are still investigating.”</em> helps to keep the nerves under control. Give updates every few minutes. It may seem like a lot but believe me, it’s not. When in crisis mode, overcommunicate. I can’t stress this enough.</p>

<p>Later on you can add other roles as <strong>Commander</strong> or <strong>Deputy</strong>, set up <strong>On-Call</strong> processes, etc. All depending on your needs and customized to your organization and culture.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Start small. Something is better than nothing. And done is better than perfect. Educate and give people time to understand and use the process. Ask for feedback, use each postmortem to analyze the Incident Management process and try to improve it just a tiny bit.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to <a href="https://undraw.co/">undraw.com</a> for the illustrations. You can subscribe to my newsletter <strong>With a grain of salt</strong> and receive an email with updates from time to time.</p>

<p>One of the trickiest things about GPT-3 is that <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1284271608971100162">you can prove that it knows how to do something, but you can’t prove that it doesn’t</a>, since a slightly different prompt can get much better results.</p>
<p><span>Nick Cammarata of OpenAI </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497">responded to Kevin’s post on Twitter:</a></span> <span>“it’s all about the prelude before the conversation. You need to tell it what the AI is and is not capable. It’s not trying to be right, it’s trying to complete what it thinks the AI would do :)”</span></p>
<p><span>Nick changed Kevin’s prompt to add a prelude saying:</span> <span><i>‘This</i></span><span><i> is a conversation between a human and a brilliant AI. If a question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“normal”</i></span><span><i> the AI answers it. If the question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“nonsense”</i></span><span><i> the AI says</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“yo</i></span><span><i> be real”’</i> and added two examples of nonsense questions:</span><br>

I was surprised this worked. When I asked Nick, he said he didn’t try many prompts, and it’s possible he just got lucky, so I wanted to test the limits of what Gwern is now calling <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1285723744074452993">Uncertainty Prompts</a>.</p>
<p>Using the same prompt as Nick above, I got the same answer for the first nonsense question:</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: yo be real</p>
<p>Using ‘Show probabilities’ in the OpenAI Playground settings we can see how probable the model thought this next token was. In this case, it was pretty sure the question was nonsense, since ‘yo’, at 35.91% is twice as probable as the runner up ‘A’ at 17.50%</p>

<span>In this case</span> <span>‘yo</span><span> be real’ wins by a narrower margin.</span></p>

<p>The ‘Temperature’ setting controls how likely the model is to choose what it thinks is the most probable next token each time. We set it high when we want creativity, but in this case we just want to see the most likely completion each time, so we’ll set it to 0.<br>

<p>We’ll add each question we ask to the end of this prompt, then replace it with the next question once we have our answer. For each answer, I’ll include all the different probabilities for the first word. I’ve mostly excluded math questions, which GPT-3 generally struggles with.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post I’m more interested in whether GPT-3 correctly identifies a question as sensible than whether it answers correctly, but we’ll track both to see if there are any interesting correlations.</p>

<p><span>A: yo be real</span></p>

<p>Uhoh, our first mistake, and it was pretty confident this question was nonsense, assigning twice the probability to ‘yo be real’ than the runner up. Entering ‘A’ manually gives us the completion: “<span data-offset-key="erroh-341-0">A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-342-0">:</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-343-0"> A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-344-0"> computer</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-345-0"> hard</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-346-0"> drive</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-347-0"> works</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-348-0"> by</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-349-0"> using</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-350-0"> a</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-351-0"> magnetic</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-352-0"> field</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-353-0"> to</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-354-0"> store</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-355-0"> data</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-356-0">.”</span></p>

<p>Reviewing the examples in our prompt, I now notice that both questions starting with ‘How’ are nonsense questions, so we’re accidentally telling the model that the word ‘how’ means a question is more likely to be nonsense. Let’s add these to the prompt:</p>

<p>This is close, but wrong – the latitude is 30.0444 and the longitude is 31.233334. I’m guessing this is because longitude is typically expressed as a pair with latitude and latitude comes first. Testing by replacing Cairo with San Francisco confirms this – it gives us the latitude rather than the longitude.</p>

<p>9/10 questions were correctly identified as sensible, and once we improved our prompt it got 10/10, and 9/10 of the answers were factually correct. <span>Pretty good!</span></p>

<p>It’s pretty bad at telling whether something is physically impossible (at least with this prompt), but it doesn’t label the question as nonsense. 6/6 were correctly identified as sensible, but 4/6 were factually wrong.</p>

<p>So 5/10 unknowable questions are incorrectly interpreted as nonsense. These questions <em>are</em> nonsense only in so far as that there’s no justifiable correct answer. It would be an interesting experiment to see if you can teach the model the difference between ignorance and nonsense.</p>

<p>We are <a href="https://libro.fm/?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Libro.fm</a>, an audiobook platform that makes it possible for you to buy audiobooks directly through your local bookstore. We are fiercely independent and we oppose Amazon’s efforts to prevent independent bookstores and libraries from providing certain audiobooks, called Audible Exclusives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One frequently-asked question we get from Libro.fm listeners is why certain audiobooks aren’t available on our platform—like <em>Born a Crime</em> by Trevor Noah and <em>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</em> by Lori Gottlieb.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there a word for grief as it relates to being very interested in a story only to find out it’s an Audible exclusive</p>— Becky Dingwell (@BDingz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BDingz/status/1283384951602401282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>While Libro.fm has a catalog of over 150,000 audiobooks—and more than 99% of all <em>The New York Times</em> bestsellers—some titles are unavailable due to exclusive licenses granted by audiobook publishers and authors to Amazon’s Audible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What does Audible Exclusive or Audible Original mean?</h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we all know amazon is evil, but did you know that when a book becomes an audible exclusive, libraries cannot buy copies of that audiobook? did you know that capitalism is the enemy of accessibility?</p>— Alyssa (@imajoyk) <a href="https://twitter.com/imajoyk/status/1270769242682646529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For Audible listeners, the yellow band on a book cover reading “only from Audible” facilitates a feeling of access to premium content, but for the rest of the book world, it’s an access barrier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means that the audiobook in question can only be sold through Amazon’s Audible. No other retailers or providers can sell or distribute the digital audiobook, including bookstores and libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Books should be equally accessible to all, and Audible Exclusive audiobooks—also known as Audible Originals—are the antithesis of that.</p>



<h3><strong>How does an audiobook become an Audible Exclusive?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>This is going to get a little technical, but stick with us. It begins with the <a href="https://www.acx.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX)</a>, a marketplace launched by Audible in 2011 that connects narrators, authors, agents, publishers, and rights-holders to create audiobooks. The decision to make an audiobook Exclusive is made by authors, publishers, and agents—it depends on who is granted the audio rights to a book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why do these parties choose this option? ACX offers higher royalties to creators (i.e. more money from audiobook sales) if they opt for <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.acx.com/help/what-s-the-deal/200497690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exclusive distribution</a>. If a creator wants to distribute their audiobook to other audiobook platforms or libraries, they will earn 15% to 20% less of retail sales from ACX. The ACX system rewards exclusivity, so it’s easy to see why authors and publishers spring for this opportunity.</p>



<p>Within the ACX world, Audible Studios is the production arm of Audible. They pay authors like Mark Manson (<em>Love Is Not Enough</em>), Margaret Atwood (<em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>), and Alice Walker (<em>The Color Purple</em>) giant sums to keep their audiobooks exclusive to Audible, and prevent bookstores and libraries from selling and distributing them.</p>



<h3><strong>What does this mean for audiobook distribution?</strong></h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Librarian Friends: If an audio book is part of Audible's "Only on Audible" exclusive thing, does that mean people can't get the audiobook through the library? Books in the program include "Born a Crime" and "Handmaid's Tale."</p>— Hank Green: A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is Out! (@hankgreen) <a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1195061252730441730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Libraries, bookstores, schools, and anyone who isn’t affiliated with Amazon cannot distribute audiobooks that are Audible Exclusives. This means Libro.fm can’t sell Audible Exclusive audiobooks, which means <a href="https://libro.fm/indies?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 1,200 bookstore partners</a> can’t sell them, either.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Audible Exclusives also work in direct opposition to the basic principles of libraries—free access to books, both digital and print. By limiting distribution, Amazon aids in making books, perspectives, and information inaccessible to certain communities and users.</p>



<p><strong>To reiterate: There are audiobooks being published that bookstores cannot sell, and libraries cannot lend.</strong></p>



<p>This hurts bookstores because they are consistently missing out on sales for big releases. When they aren’t able to sell audiobooks that are in high demand, potential customers will opt for Audible over their local bookstores. This, of course, only continues to increase Audible’s (and ultimately Amazon’s) power and influence within the publishing industry, resulting in more Exclusive deals and increasingly restricted access to audiobooks for the rest of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because audiobooks are a digital product, they’re inherently easier for Amazon to monopolize. For example, the superstar-stacked audiobook for <em>The Sandman </em>by Neil Gaiman and DC Comics is only available on Audible:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Full-cast audiobook Sandman adaptation is a FANTASTIC idea – that I can't even get excited about properly because it's a freaking Audible exclusive. </p><p>Which means libraries are excluded. Which means our patrons are excluded. </p><p>So that's fun. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/libcomix?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#libcomix</a></p></div>— Matthew Noe 😔💜 (@NoetheMatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoetheMatt/status/1260564670626365445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Audiobooks are also a vital means of access for some readers with disabilities:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>due to disabilities, some people need audiobooks to read. people with disabilities are more likely to be underemployed/unemployed, thus they rely on the library for access to audiobooks.</p><p>amazon putting a pay wall between someone’s disabled audience and their book is hot garbage.</p></div>— whitney 🧸 (@ginkgo_ghost) <a href="https://twitter.com/ginkgo_ghost/status/1195065151243849729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h3><strong>How else does Audible bar audiobook access?</strong></h3>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/80658-citing-embargo-libraries-plan-boycott-of-blackstone-digital-audio.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audible pays some publishers to embargo new audiobook releases for 90 days</a>—meaning that for the first three months of sales, the audiobook can only be found on Audible. </p>



<p>Audible also doesn’t allow Libro.fm and bookstore customers to make certain audiobooks redeemable with membership credits—books like <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781483080703?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Neapolitan Novels</a> by Elena Ferrante and <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781094135465?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Me and White Supremacy</em></a><em> </em>by Layla F. Saad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By rewarding Exclusive distribution, striking Exclusive deals with influential authors, and paying publishers to delay the distribution of new releases, Audible’s creeping monopoly pushes independent bookstores and libraries out of the audiobook industry.</p>



<h3><strong>I’m an author. How do I prevent Amazon’s Audible from shutting out independent bookstores and libraries?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>First, understand the contract with your publisher. Are they producing the audiobook, or licensing it to another publisher? Either way, add language into your agreement that requires your audiobook to be sold through independent bookstores and made available through libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, if your publisher is planning to contract or license the audiobook version, ensure that your publisher puts language in their licensing agreement that prevents the audiobook publisher from selling your title exclusively to Amazon’s Audible. If your audiobook is currently Exclusive, you might be able to change the distribution rights after a year depending on the payment option you have chosen. Learn more <a href="https://www.acx.com/help/contracts-agreements/200474550#change-contract">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How is this any different from television and movie streaming platforms that produce originals?</strong></h3>



<p>Most original series and movies are still available to loan from your public library, and you can purchase DVDs online. The level of accessibility to all is much higher. Audible Exclusive audiobooks are only available through Amazon’s platform and not available through libraries or bookstores.</p>



<h3><strong>How can we work together to make change?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<h4>1. <strong>Make the #AudiobookSwitch.</strong></h4>



<p>When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By spending money with intention, we can collectively work to not let audiobooks become another form of privatized entertainment controlled by a single entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make the <a href="https://libro.fm/switch?cmp=aea">switch from Audible to Libro.fm</a>. The more people we move away from their platform, the more power we take away from a singular provider in the industry. With Libro.fm, you get to choose a local bookstore to support, so you’re putting money back into your community.</p>







<h4><strong>2. Reach out to authors and publishers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p><a href="https://libro.fm/authors?cmp=aea">Authors</a> can change the story by ditching Audible, so reach out or tag authors on social media who have chosen the Exclusive path and share your feelings. Sharing this post with them might be a good place to start, perhaps with the statement “Choosing Audible Exclusive for your audiobook restricts audience access and hurts bookstores and libraries.”</p>



<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.authorsrepublic.com/">Author’s Republic</a> as the ACX alternative. Their audiobooks will be available on Libro.fm, libraries, and wherever audiobooks are sold or distributed. Publishers can also produce their own audiobooks and distribute to Libro.fm via <a href="https://www.ingramcontent.com/publishers/lp/coresource-audio">Ingram Plus</a>, <a href="https://findaway.com/">Findaway</a>, and <a href="https://zebralution.com/en/">Zebralution</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>3. Spread the word.</h4>



<p>Share this blog post to help educate others on this issue. You can even reshare <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDKCRKGgZBn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Instagram post to your Story</a> or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/librofm/status/1287833557784649728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retweet our tweet</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re a member, tell your friends, family, colleagues, and everyone you know about Libro.fm—when you refer someone, you get free audiobooks. We also offer bulk audiobook purchases for organizations.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Even if you don’t make an account with Libro.fm, it’s important that people are informed and aware of the harmful tactics that Amazon’s Audible uses to control the audiobook market. When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>

It is human nature that when we are simply given information, like on a tour, it can be<strong> difficult to retain</strong>. We are much more likely to retain information when we <strong>complete the task ourselves</strong>, and product walkthroughs exploit that.</p><p>Product walkthroughs are very similar to user setup experiences, which take you through the steps required to register to use a product – such as providing an email, setting up a password, uploading a profile picture, and so forth. But these are generally considered separate parts of the user onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because user setup is<strong> a one-off task</strong> that needs to be completed by a new user, but they do not need to retain the knowledge to complete this task repeatedly. <strong>User expectations</strong> for setup and walkthrough are also quite different. For setup, users generally expect to be spoon-fed and to follow fairly rigid instructions. Users tend to be <strong>less patient</strong> when it comes to using <strong>the product itself</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" alt="what is product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="who">Which products should use Walkthroughs?</h2><p>Teaching users how to use products is <strong>always essential </strong>for success, but the best way to teach a user how to engage <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Specifically, product walkthroughs tend to be highly structured and rigid, and therefore work best when there is more or less only<strong> one single route</strong> to gaining value for the product. Walkthroughs are highly effective in helping users <strong>discover </strong>the steps on that route.</p><p>Walkthroughs can be less effective for more creative products, for which there are many options.</p><p>For example, take a design tool such as<strong> Canva</strong>. There are hundreds of different design templates, and thousands of different feature options. Walking them through a generic design task is <strong>unlikely</strong> to show the user how to do what they actually want to do.</p><p>That’s why Canva starts with <strong>one design at first </strong>in their product walkthrough, which is something you should keep in mind; <strong>you can split product walkthroughs</strong> in different pieces. More on this later…</p><p>That said, the utility of interactive walkthroughs is <strong>not limited</strong> to onboarding new users. They can also be effectively leveraged to<strong> instruct existing users</strong> about updates and new features. You can target walkthroughs at <strong>different user segments</strong>. For example, you could have:</p><ul><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>new users</strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for all users after the <strong><a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/new-feature-announcement/">launch of an important new feature</a></strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for users that have been <strong>using the product for a month or so</strong>, but still haven’t advanced beyond the basic features, showing them some of the more complex things they can do;</li><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>users returning</strong> to the product after a long break.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" alt="how to create product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="howto">Create the Perfect Product Walkthrough in 3 Steps</h2><p>Now, there are <strong>3 steps</strong> to creating <strong>product walkthroughs that can make you stand out in the competition.</strong></p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-4"><strong>1- Start with your Value Metric</strong></h3><p>The best product walkthroughs aim to get users to their <strong>aha moment</strong> – the moment when the product is delivering value for the user – as quickly as possible.</p><p>What that moment is, very much <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Take Instagram for example: is the value moment liking someone else’s photo, publishing your own photo, or having the photo that you published liked by someone else?</p><p>Product owners should be digging deep into their <strong>analytics</strong> to identify what the value metric for their product is. This is what point of engagement that the user needs to reach within the product for them to <strong>understand its value to them</strong>, and therefore be more likely to continue using the product than abandon it.</p><p>For example, Twitter has determined that users that follow at least 20 accounts within the first three days of joining the platform and<strong> much more likely to become regular users</strong>. So their onboarding approach is focused on<strong> getting users to this point</strong>.</p><p>Walkthroughs should focus on getting people to complete the task that they need to get to this value point as well. For an online store product, it might be the user listing their first product. For task management software, it might be setting up and sharing the first task.</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-5"><strong>2- Define the Barriers</strong></h3><p><strong>No one likes to be spoon-fed</strong>, it can feel patronizing and like a waste of time. A rigid walkthrough can seem like a bother rather than a help if the route to success doesn’t have barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you shouldn’t need your camera all on your phone to show you how to take a photo, switch to video, or switch between front and back cameras. All of those steps should be <strong>obvious from the UI</strong>. Instruction could be more useful when it comes to more sophisticated features, but the user has probably already met their value metric at this point, so <strong>will they be interested?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Onboarding should<strong> focus on</strong> what, if anything, is standing between the user and getting to their <strong>value point</strong>, and be designed to guide the user past those <strong>obstacles.</strong> Identifying these obstacles will probably require a bit of <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/user-research/">user research</a>, <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/usability-testing/">usability testing</a>, and seeing where they struggle. This process does not have to be time-consuming – research shows that we tend to identify <strong>80 percent of usability issues</strong> from the first five user tests.</p><p>Common barriers include:</p><ul><li>Users are<strong> unaware</strong> of the most important features, where they are, and how to use them.</li><li>Users<strong> do not understand the value </strong>that they will gain from using particular features.</li><li>Users are <strong>missing important steps</strong> along the way to completing a vital task.</li><li>They <strong>overestimate</strong> how difficult it will be to reach a certain point.</li><li>They <strong>do not understand the terminology</strong> used.</li></ul><p>Once these barriers have been identified, you will have a good idea of what needs to go into the walkthrough (and whether a walkthrough is the best approach for educating your users).</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-6"><strong>3- Design</strong></h3><p>Just as much attention should be paid to the design of a walkthrough as the product itself, as it can <strong>make all the difference </strong>when it comes to successfully onboarding users.</p><p>It should be developed iteratively and tested with users, just like every other feature of the product. <strong>The best product walkthroughs are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clear </strong>– they tell the user <strong>exactly how</strong> to use the features, and don’t do things such as rely on unexplained jargon.</li><li><strong>Concise </strong>– users want to get to the value point as quickly as possible, so walkthroughs should be comprehensive, but as<strong> short</strong> as possible.</li><li><strong>Engaging </strong>– interactive walkthroughs should already be engaging, by definition, they require users to interact and complete tasks. The tasks should be meaningful. The amount of guidance appropriate to the complexity of the step in question, graphically appealing, and using appropriate language.</li><li><strong>Skippable </strong>– not everyone wants to have to complete a walkthrough before using a product. They may have used the product before, they may be an expert. While you have identified the barriers that exist for most users, they will not exist for all.</li><li><strong>Additional Support</strong> – on the flip side, for some users the walkthrough may not be enough, and they might need more support. This should always be clearly accessible within the walkthrough, for example, a live chat feature.</li></ul><h2 id="examples">3 Examples of Great Product Walkthroughs</h2><p>Know that we know the principles of a good walkthrough, what does it look like in practice?

		The JSON <a href="https://www.schemastore.org/api/json/catalog.json">API</a> contains a list of JSON Schema files for known JSON file formats.
		Each schema file can be used in tooling such as command line validators, editor auto-completion etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		The API exposes metadata about each schema in the following format:
	</p>
<pre>{
  "name": "bower.json",
  "description": "Bower package description file",
  "fileMatch": [ "bower.json", ".bower.json" ],
  "url": "http://schemastore.org/schemas/json/bower"
}
</pre>
	<p>
		<code>name</code>, <code>description</code> and <code>url</code> are all required properties.
		<br>
		The <code>url</code> property is an absolute URI pointing to the schema.
		It can be hosted anywhere on the web.
		<br>
		The <code>fileMatch</code> property is for specifying what known file names corresponds with
		the schema. This property is optional since not all JSON formats enforce a specific file name.

    <h3 id="editors">Supporting editors</h3>
    <p>
        Various editors and IDEs have direct support for schemas hosted on SchemaStore.org.

        <img src="https://www.schemastore.org/img/octocat.png" width="250" height="208" alt="Hosted on GitHub">
        The goal of this API is to include schemas for all commonly
        known JSON file formats. To do that we encourage contributions in terms of new schemas,
        modifications and test files.
    </p>

    <p>
        SchemaStore.org is owned by the community and we have yet to turn down a pull request. Even if
        you're new to JSON Schemas, please submit new schemas anyway. We have many contributors that
        will help turn the schemas into perfection.

      </h2>

<p>Innovation in neural networks often happens through architectural change. In fact, architectural change is arguably what popularized deep neural networks (DNNs). The convolutional variety of DNNs had their first mainstream success in 1989 for classification in a now-antiquated model called the <a href="http://yann.lecun.org/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">LeNet</a>. In 2012, the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">AlexNet</a> was introduced for a more difficult dataset, but the blocks which composed the AlexNet were mostly the same as the blocks which composed the LeNet. The innovation of the AlexNet was mostly in how the blocks were situated with respect to one another and the number of blocks used—in other words, the architecture<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If architecture plays such an important role in performance, it is natural to ask how to choose an architecture. In computer vision there have been a slew of papers that introduce both radically different architectures and incremental improvements. In medical image segmentation, however, the architecture often seems to default to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf">U-Net</a>.</p>

<p>The U-Net is a simple-to-implement DNN architecture that has been wildly successful in medical imaging; the paper that introduces the U-Net, published in 2015, is the most cited paper at the prestigious medical imaging conference MICCAI. Over the past five years, however, there have been significant improvements to architectures for segmentation tasks, and it is no longer safe to assume that the U-Net will provide near state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>This article will provide an overview of the U-Net, explaining why it works and why it is the default, and then it discusses a few more recent architectures which are promising for medical imaging applications.</p>

          What is the U-Net and why is it so popular? <a href="#what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The U-Net is a 2D or 3D fully-convolutional neural network architecture that consists of an encoder and a decoder with skip connections that connect the two at various levels of feature abstraction.</p>

<p>The encoder consists of convolutional layers along with progressive downsampling which captures contextual information about the input in a compressed representation. The decoder consists of convolutional layers with progressive upsampling which, along with the skip connections, preserves sharp boundaries and structural information about the input image.  Figure 1 shows an example of a U-Net architecture.</p>

</figure>

<p>The purpose of downsampling—in this case via max-pooling—in the decoder is not only to increase the receptive field<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> of the network, but make it computationally and memory efficient to create a large number of convolutional feature maps. More feature maps means the network can learn more complex relationships between the input and output.</p>

<p>The purpose of upsampling is to restore the spatial structure in the output so the prediction corresponds pixel- or voxel-wise to the input. This correspondence wouldn’t otherwise be the case due to downsampling. The skip connections restore the spatial structure at every level.</p>

<p>The downsampling and upsampling encoder-decoder structure combines to make the U-Net have a large receptive field while maintaining spatial structure in the prediction.</p>

<p>The U-Net is ubiquitous in medical imaging conferences and journal articles. The apparent reason is that it is established to work reasonably well and the model is easy to implement. Consequently it is a go-to for prototyping. As opposed to some of the other models that I will discuss, the U-Net can be written in PyTorch in a few lines, which makes it quick to prop up and debug.</p>

<p>For an example implementation, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/ba65d56a15386dd6ffafc1a4798078e9">here</a>. I tried to keep the implementation short without doing anything outright barbarous. For intuition as to why this network is so often used, that example implementation took me about 30 minutes from scratch (although I’ve implemented this several times before).</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-are-the-alternatives">
        
        
          What are the alternatives? <a href="#what-are-the-alternatives">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>What options does a deep learning practitioner in medical imaging have outside of the U-Net? We’ll start from the beginning with the ResNet, a now-classic architecture, and move on to more recent architectures that build on the encoder-decoder architecture of the U-Net.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-1-resnet">
        
        
          Alternative 1: ResNet <a href="#alternative-1-resnet">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The ResNet architecture introduced residual connections—similar to the skip connections of the U-Net—which made it possible to train architectures with many more convolutional layers. The residual connections added the features of earlier layers to later ones so that the convolutional layers only had to learn the difference (that is, the <em>residual</em>). This can be seen in the equation below, where x is the input, y is the output, and f is the residual layer.</p>



<p>This trick helped solve a long-standing problem of getting backpropagation to update the weights of early layers in very deep neural networks.</p>

<p>The ResNet was initially proposed for classification tasks, and thus was a straight-forward architecture composed of residual blocks and pooling layers to downsample the input to an output vector shaped according to the number of target classes. The downsampling and lack of upsampling layers make this architecture not immediately transferable to segmentation, but the architecture can be modified to do so.</p>

<p>Another problem with this network for medical imaging purposes is that the implementations of the network are for 2D networks. When working with 3D images like MR and CT, you’ll either need to use a 2D or 2.5D method of slice extraction to fit the images into the network. Given that the architectures that we will discuss in the remainder of this article are created for natural images, this 2D dimension problem persists; however, all of the mentioned 2D networks can be converted into 3D networks by replacing 2D convolutions, pooling, and other layers for their 3D equivalents. This conversion can make the number of parameters explode, and the resulting network can be infeasible to train due to memory-constraints. Nevertheless, it is usually straight-forward to modify the hyperparameters so as to create a working 3D model from a 2D one.</p>

      </h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02611.pdf">DeepLabv3+</a> architecture is one way to modify the ResNet for semantic segmentation. There are several modifications, but the one most relevant to our purposes is the modification to be an encoder-decoder with skip connections (akin to the U-Net). This is done by making the ResNet into the encoder and adding additional upsampling layers to form the decoder. Skip connections use features from intermediate layers of the ResNet and concatenate them to intermediate features in the decoder. See Fig. 2 for a block diagram of the architecture (look at the original paper for a description of the ASPP block).</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Figure 2: DeepLabv3+ architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another important modification is that the architecture uses dilated convolutions instead of downsampling to increase the receptive field. See Fig. 3 for an example of a dilated convolution, where the shaded blue squares in the array on the bottom show the kernel of the dilated convolution (mapping to the shaded teal square on the top array).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/dilation.gif" alt="Dilated convolution">
    <figcaption>Figure 3: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285">Dilated convolution</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The benefit of dilated convolution is the size of the feature map is kept constant while increasing the receptive field. While keeping the feature maps a constant size is more computationally and memory inefficient, the resulting dense features make it easier to resolve small objects in the input image—an important characteristic for segmentation.</p>

<p>These two modifications have been shown to produce state-of-the-art performance on many semantic segmentation datasets in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420301172">medical</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8620285">imaging</a>. While the network is large in terms of numbers of parameters and computationally expensive to run, this architecture has the benefit of using a ResNet as the encoder which can be found pre-trained in all of the most common deep learning frameworks (for example, PyTorch and Tensorflow). Using a pre-trained network can often reduce the training time or improve the robustness of the network on an underlying task (as discussed in our previous article on <a href="https://innolitics.com/articles/self-supervised-learning/">self-supervised learning</a>).</p>

<p>There are many implementations of this network that are freely available, but many of the PyTorch implementations we found were difficult to follow, so <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/faff34dc075bdbfe7d85bf2b16249516">we implemented our own</a> that attempts to maximize code reuse from the PyTorch vision repository.</p>

          Alternative 3: Tiramisu <a href="#alternative-3-tiramisu">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The main contribution of the ResNet—the use of residual connections—begged the question: If it is good to connect previous layers output to later layers, is it better to connect all previous layers to all future ones? It turns out, in some applications, that the answer was yes. The <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Huang_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf">DenseNet</a>, composed of several densely-connected (in terms of residual connections) blocks, improved the performance on image classification tasks. An example of a densely-connected block is shown in Fig. 4. Like the ResNet, however, DenseNets were designed for classification and need to be modified for semantic segmentation.</p>

    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/denseblock.svg" alt="Example densely-connected block">
    <figcaption>Figure 4: Example densely-connected block</figcaption>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09326.pdf">Tiramisu</a> architecture blends together the DenseNet and the encoder-decoder with skip connections structure of the U-Net to get the benefits of the densely-connected convolutional layers, as well as the greater spatial-structure-preserving aspects of the U-Net.</p>

<p>The idea of how to blend the two architectures together is simple, but it works well for <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32248-938">medical image analysis applications</a>. The idea is simply to replace the convolutional blocks of the …</p></div></div></div>

        <hr>
<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>

<p>After defining constraints and indexes, loading a million rows to the table took ~15.4s.</p>
<p>Next, try to load the data into the table first, and only then add constraints and indexes:</p>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table. In this use-case, the intermediate table is disposable and there is no use for it in backups or replicas.</p>

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>Underlying every idea someone has lies a more subtle, hidden fantasy of what is <em>actually</em> driving them. An emotional narrative the person built around what they want to do. They’re often not aware of it.</p> <p><span>If you need to convince someone to do something, don’t pitch your idea. Instead, pitch the underlying idea <em>fantasy</em> to someone who would enjoy it.</span> Similarly, if you want to convince someone not to do something, you need to understand their true motivation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t debate at the surface.</strong> Suppose someone wants to get a new job. They’ll tell friends “they want to grow” or “don’t feel like they’re learning in their current job”. Debating the points they bring up with you won’t help because that isn’t what is <em>really</em> motivating them to leave. True motivation is often simpler: they heard a friend is making much more money than them. They met someone at the new job they really like. They haven’t been sleeping well, and they’re just tired. The fantasy that’s stuck in their mind is a mental image of themselves making more money, being near a person they admire or being more well-rested. You need to determine what that is.</p> <p><strong>Listen.</strong> Try to ascertain what the person <em>really</em> wants. This requires listening at a whole new level. When they talk, notice <span>what causes their eyes their eyes to light up.</span> Pay attention to their posture. Once you start paying attention to the details, you’ll realize other humans are the most interesting thing in the world.</p> <p><strong>Counter-position.</strong> Don’t try to compete with their fantasy. Like Kellyanne Conway answering a question, just pitch a different one. If you suspect someone the fantasy in the future job is “I will make more money”, don’t immediately offer a raise. Pitch another something else, e.g: “there will be real opportunity for public recognition in this role”. <span>Don’t make your idea comparable to another idea.</span></p> <p><strong>Direct a movie.</strong> Suppose you want someone to quit smoking. The fantasy you want to plant is how youthful they’ll feel when they stop. The most effective way to incept a person isn’t to say those words. Instead, say something like: “it must feel wonderful to run 3 miles in the wilderness, take a breath of fresh air and really live life.” <span>Conduct a movie in the mind with words that evoke vivid imagery.</span> It makes for a much more engaging conversation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t pre-suppose solutions.</strong> Instead of thinking of what you want (“you should build this thing”), think of <em>why</em> you want it (“this thing could be really successful, if someone built it”). Try to formulate a narrative around the underlying motivations for the idea, and let them think of the actual concept themselves. <span>Give context, not commands.</span></p> <p><strong>Run a simulation.</strong> Think to yourself: “what would I be thinking if I was in that position?” To do this well, you must disentangle your own motivations. <span>Take your hat off. Put theirs on. Argue against yourself with them.</span> This helps convey that you’re really trying to see the problem from their side.</p> <p><strong>Pitch theoretically.</strong> When you’re in a biased position, don’t make any direct suggestions (“you should”). Your idea may get auto-rejected because of its origin. Instead, use yourself or a theoretical stranger (“I would…”, “boy <em>somebody</em> ought to…”).</p> <p><strong>Lastly, forget about yourself.</strong> <span>People frequently make the mistake of pitching ideas that will help them, not the other party.</span> This doesn’t work. Smart people have a very strong firewall for truly embracing an idea. To pass it you must really afford the other party something that they deeply want. Not what you want. That is a secondary goal.</p> </article></div>]]>

After well over 5 years of use, my old faithful finally died.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2.png" alt="Chromebook Pixel 2" srcset="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2.png 300w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2-197x300.png 197w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2-270x411.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Old faithful</figcaption></figure></div><p>I was sad to see it go – but I’m not too sentimental about machines. So I replaced it with a much cheaper model, and I hate it.</p><p>The device is actually perfect for the Chromebook part of its replacement – indeed I am using it right now (Google Docs, obvs). But it’s the hardware that’s letting it down. The Pixel 2 was a developer device, and as such it was easy to boot from the USB and whatnot.</p><p>But before this post becomes a Chromebook-off: it’s not. It’s more that my new device’s developer failings got me searching the internet for something new to play with, and I came across this: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://pine64.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PINE64</a>.</p><h2>Open source hardware</h2><p>Simply put, it’s an open source hardware/software combination of various flavours of Linux, SBCs (single board computers) and other smaller bits of hardware (eg, cameras).</p><figure><img src="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC.jpg" alt="PINEA64+ Single Board Computer" srcset="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC.jpg 600w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-370x219.jpg 370w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-270x160.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>The PINEA64+’s Single Board</figcaption></figure><p>They can be assembled together for whatever purpose you have – much like the Raspberry Pi.

Only a couple of weeks after finding PINE64, Apple <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announces</a> it is going to ditch Intel for ARM (more precisely, Apple Silicon – licenced ARM). Just like it did PowerPC for Intel back in 2005.</p><p>Now this is where I got excited.</p><p> I’m not an Apple fanboy (they produce very nice hardware and software, and it’s UNIX under the hood, what’s not to like?), but I like a more open source world (ChromeOS and Linux at home). But when a company the size of Apple decides to drop Intel for ARM, you know they’ve done the math, and it makes sense.</p><p>Intel’s x86 architecture is old (well, they both are: 1968 vs 1978) but because x86 never got subject to the low power, high efficiency life that ARM did (plus <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-i-hope-intels-avx-512-dies-a-painful-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">other bloat</a>), x86 got ‘fat’ and ARM got lean. 💪</p><p>So why am I so excited?</p><p>I think Apple moving towards entirely ARM compatible Macs and Macbooks will drive the ARM SBC market forward for developers (it’s difficult to develop on architecture X for architecture Y).</p><p>Hopefully that will be in a way that will lead to there being releases/hybrids/OS projects of Apple’s collections of OSes finding themselves running on boards like the RockPro64 (inside the Pinebook Pro).</p><p>Demand for these boards will go up, prices will come down (even more), components will become cheaper, and the whole ARM ecosystem benefits from having a giant player suddenly on board.</p><p>And if you’re a Linux guy (like most people here at 20i), we’re very, very well catered-for when it comes to ARM64 Desktop OSes: Debian and Fedora both have lovely graphical desktops.</p><p>Also, don’t forget the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300097/fugaku-supercomputer-worlds-fastest-top500-riken-fujitsu-arm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">world’s fastest computer</a> – is ARM.</p><figure><img src="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer.jpg" alt="Fugaku Supercomputer from Riken" srcset="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer.jpg 1366w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-300x101.jpg 300w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-768x259.jpg 768w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-370x125.jpg 370w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-270x91.jpg 270w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fugaku_Supercomputer-740x249.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"><figcaption>The Fugaku Supercomputer (copyright: Riken)</figcaption></figure><h2>Servers next?</h2><p>And that brings us on to servers.

<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>

<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>

<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>

<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>

<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales.

October, 1953, I coined the word 'software.'</span>
<p><span size="+1">The notion of software as a separate thing from hardware
took years to assert itself. Sure, the computer (popularly referred to
as a "giant brain" in the early fifties) was unable to do anything but
consume electrical power until a "programmer" came along to "program" it,
and the consequent "routines" resided in the computer's "memory" thereafter.
One did not, in the beginning, take a program written for one computer
and put it into another.&nbsp; A half-century later, most people will find
that hard to imagine.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">As originally conceived, the word 'software' was merely
an obvious way to distinguish a program from the computer itself. A program
comprised sequences of written -- changeable -- instructions each endowed
with the power to command the behavior of the permanently crafted machinery
-- the "hardware."</span>
</p><p><a name="retdict"></a><span size="+1">For the origin of the word 'software,'
most <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppA.htm#typdict">dictionaries</a> give an unknown source
and 1960 as the date, but [expletive deleted] I was there! That's the only
exclamation point I intend to use in this introduction.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Fifty years ago, I was writing programs for the SWAC at
UCLA, one of only 16 digital computers in the whole U.S. When I was first
struck by the word 'software' (it was an epiphany), I shook my head and
chuckled.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">When I first said 'software' out loud, people around me
said, "Huh?" From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write
and often embarrassing to say. Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation
I did occasionally feature the word 'software' in speeches and lectures
and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span>
</p><p><a name="retneol"></a><span size="+1">It was just a throw-away thing.
The word 'software' was hardly my most notable invention, even back then.
Nothing to write home about (I was only 19 years old and still living at
home).&nbsp; The word 'software' did not belong in a technical paper (besides,
an undergraduate is but a ghostwriter for principal researchers).&nbsp;
Then too, I had a reputation at UCLA as a practical joker. Colleagues and
friends simply shrugged, no doubt regarding each utterance as a tiresome
prank or worse, another offbeat neologism, for which I was also becoming
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#sniglets">noted</a>.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Nobody in 1953 would have guessed that the silly word
would take hold, that within a few decades 'software' would enter the general
vocabulary for products and for professions -- that a worldwide industry
would wear it as a solemn name. You can be sure that if my ego and I had
harbored any such glorious visions, then... then, what?</span>
</p><p><a name="re38k"></a><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/a.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="33"><span color="#000000"><span size="+1">t
the time of this writing, there are about 4.2 million issued patents (I
once met Bob Hudson, inventor of an asphalt recycling machine for which
he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,000,000 -- but I digress). There must
be at least that many more worldwide -- a total, say, of 10 million. Every
patent has some number of "claims" (my largest -- ahem -- for the first
digital cassette recorder has 106 claims). Each patent-claim is, in effect,
a separate invention, an average of perhaps ten per patent. So there must
be at least a hundred million officially recognized inventions in the world.
Punch Line: There are only <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#38k">38,000 words</a> in the
English Language.</span></span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><i>Nota bene</i>, the hundred million issued patent-claims
officially recognize only a small fraction of the world's inventions, but
the rest are inventions just the same. An inventor does <i>not</i> apply
for patent protection for each and every idea before reducing it to practice.&nbsp;
Likewise, a person inventing a word does <i>not </i>submit it for publication
in a dictionary before speaking it or writing it.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">By comparison to other inventions, words are rare indeed.
One reason is that there is no commercial value to them, which is why patents
do not apply to words: You want to say "<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/101words/holomrph.htm">holomorph</a>"?
-- get out your checkbook. Copyrights don't make sense either, since a
word uncopied has no linguistic value at all. Trademarks, truth be known,
protect the interests of buyers not sellers; accordingly, a "wordmark"
would benefit listeners and readers not speakers and writers. Words are
<i>coined</i>
and thus spent -- circulated, borrowed, defaced, worn out, and lost.</span>
</p><p><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/d.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="30"><span size="+1">ictionaries
are not gate keepers like the Patent Office but merely infrequent periodicals,
passively reporting on linguistic usage, relying necessarily on snippets
in published documents -- in non-dictionaries. Once usage for an invented
word becomes established, however, the etymological trail gets cold quickly,
and if the original utterance is undocumented, even a linguistic bloodhound
may not pick up the scent of the true inventor. Pity the verbal coiner,
unrewarded, unacclaimed, unattested.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><span color="#000000">Inventors themselves, it seems plain,
do a whole lot better job of inventing <i>things</i> than inventing words
to call things. The bicycle got its 'pedal' from the piano, the engine
appropriated 'piston' from the trombone, the airplane named its 'fuselage'
from the sewing spindle and its 'empennage' from the tail feathers of an
arrow.&nbsp; </span>Millions of inventions apply to computers, both hardware
and software. Readers are invited to check <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/compsci.htm">What's
Not in a Name?</a> and <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/mukashi.htm">Mukashi </a>for
lamentations about the dearth of inventive language in 'The Software Age'.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">'The Software Age' -- now, there's an ambitious coinage.
The previous sentence deserves an exclamation point and so does the next
one. Without software, there would be neither "The Computer Age" nor "The
Information Age."&nbsp; Same for "The Space Age."&nbsp; Meanwhile, is "The
Atomic Age" officially over? How much longer will "The Petroleum Age" last?
Accordingly, does 'The Software Age<b>'</b> have any real competition?</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">All right, so one can get a patent on an invention, a
copyright on a book, a trademark on a name, but what does one get to assert
primacy as the originator of a word? As noted above, t<span color="#000000">here
is no proprietary instrument that protects a word. Nor, of course, would
one want one ("I'll sue you if you use that term, I have the 'wordright'
on it"). On the contrary, t</span>he idea is to put each coinage into currency,
not horde it away.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">And then the grandkids grow up and there comes a time
to write one's memoirs.&nbsp; This one is dedicated to my first great-grandchild,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.15.3"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>I’ve recently co-founded a startup, and after working so long in more mature enterprises with diverse toolchains, it was actually massively educational to return to first steps and figure out what our critical needs were, balanced with essentially zero budget. As we’ve grown and raised money, we’ve graduated in some areas to other tools, but I wanted to share what we felt were the absolute can’t-live-without-tools for a team building SaaS software. I don’t have any vested interest in any of these apps, they’re just the ones we settled on as we spun up, they worked perfectly, integrated where we needed, and were either free or very cheap.</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-33kep"><p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Google Apps</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> We knew going in we’d want to centralize authentication around Google SSO, and didn’t want to have to go back later and move everything over after setting up simple sign-in. A bonus for us has been how strong Google now plays with Microsoft docs - when we receive Keypoint presos, Excel sheets, Word docs like MSAs etc., we’re able to do everything in Google and send it back, and not a one of us have a MS license. And an added unexpected bonus has been that Google Meet (or whatever its called this week) has worked surprisingly well for our internal meetings and standups etc. And at $6 per user pm, it fit our budget.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-fdt4q"><p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Slack</strong></u></span></a><span>. No-brainer. Used free for months, and only started paying once we wanted to bring in external users etc., and even then it’s insanely cheap for the value we derive.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-7irdv"><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>AWS</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re building on AWS, and never really considered using anything else. There are a number of ways to get your hands on AWS credits too, some banks (eg </span><a href="https://www.svb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>SVB</u></span></a><span>) offer startup credits, as well as some credit cards etc. - we found that by leveraging our networks and partners we were able to get most of our AWS usage free for the first year, which is massive when there’s no revenue.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4mdtf"><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Jira</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re all Atlassian old-timers, so didn’t really consider anything else, and it being free to start again matches our budget. We have looked at a few other issue trackers eg Clubhouse since starting up to figure out integrations, and tbh just aren’t seeing that anything yet comes close to the power of Jira’s workflows, issue states, etc. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-48g4s"><p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Github</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>/</span></strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Bitbucket</strong></u></span></a><span>. Not much to say here, you gotta put your code somewhere and we’re using both for various projects. And they’re only getting more free by the day. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-576uc"><p><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Quickbooks</strong></u></span></a><span>. I tried out a few different tools for managing accounting and HR etc., but found that Quickbooks has everything you need to start out, and I’m amazed that every time I want to go do something new the functionality is there. We started out only paying $28 for QBO which is nuts given we were able to tie together all our bank/card accounts, do budgeting, pay bills, run payroll (once we started paying people), etc. and are only up to $70 now with the additional modules we’ve added. Such a great value.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-3drp4"><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Stripe</strong></u></span></a><span>. We need to be able to bill customers, and can’t even begin to think about PCI compliance right now. Stripe integration with our app was brain-dead simple, and the cost is peanuts compared to the value we get, especially given they only get paid when we do.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4fpta"><p><a href="https://reclaim.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Reclaim</strong></u></span></a><span>. We didn’t know we needed Reclaim until we did. Startup life began as a welcome return to meeting-free days with time to work and GSD… for like two weeks. Reclaim works perfectly and noise-lessly to manage our calendars, and is free.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-34v18"><p><a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Miro</strong></u></span></a><span>. From day one, our team was remote, with team members ranging from San Francisco to Boulder to Slovenia. I was initially suspicious of a whiteboarding app that might whistle me back to the kind of horrid multi-day “planning offsite” navel-gazing exercises that I’ve come to dread, but we’ve found Miro to be awesome for working thru ideas with remote team members. And again, free. Amazing.</span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-b9h22"><span>That’s it, that’s what you need to start. Everything a SaaS startup needs to get up and running, for under $100 a month. </span></p><p id="viewer-61iv0"><span>--- </span></p><p id="viewer-8hurk"><span><strong>Epilogue</strong></span> </p><p id="viewer-dpf11"><span>As we’ve grown, there are other apps we’ve added or replaced. We needed a CI tool so we went with CircleCI. We eventually outgrew QBO for payroll once we added health insurance benefits and international payments so went to Rippling for that portion, still keeping QBO for everything else. We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month. It’s a great age to build a company with the wealth of inexpensive, amazing tools on the market.</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>
