		<p>
I am often asked what I mean when I say that developers spend most of their time figuring the system out. Let’s unpack the statement.
</p>
<p>
The oldest reference on the topic I know of dates back to 1979 in a book by Zelkowitz, Shaw, and Gannon entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-software-engineering-design-Prentice-Hall/dp/013710202X">Principles of software engineering and design</a>. It said that most of the development time was spent on maintenance (67%).
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Software development costs (1979)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Granted, the book does not specify how the figure was obtained. Still, it was deemed an important enough problem to attract significant research attention since then.
</p>
<p>
So, how far are we now, more than 4 decades later?
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at a recent paper by Xia, Bao, Lo, Xing, Hassan, &amp; Li entitled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318811113_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_A_Large-Scale_Field_Study_with_Professionals">Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals</a> and published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 44, 951-976, 2018. This paper is quite interesting in that it describes in great details how the figures are obtained. And it says that Comprehension took on average ~58%.
</p>
<p>
Now, take a closer look at the results table.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/2018-costs.png" alt="Software development costs (2018)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (2018)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In particular, take a look at the third column in the table: it says Navigation accounts for 24% of the effort, and that is considered separately from the Comprehension effort!
</p>
<p>
So, after 4 decades, we can observe that not much has changed beside learning how to measure the “figuring out” time.
</p>
<p>
So what?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out" time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
</p>
<p>
If we do talk about how the “figuring out the system” time is spent, we notice that people spend it reading. In fact, as the above paper also shows, comprehension is essentially measured as reading! The two are considered as mostly synonymous.
</p>
<p>
So, how should we talk about how we figure the system out?
</p>
<p>
Given that not much happened for 4 decades, we should entertain the idea that maybe we should frame the problem differently. 
</p>
<p>
Please, bear with me. This is where it gets interesting. So, why do developers read code? Because they want to figure the situation enough to know what to do next. The intent is important. This is decision making.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/decision-making.png" alt="The figuring out time is a decision making time">
	<figcaption>The figuring out time is a decision making time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
From this perspective, reading is just the means through which information is gathered from data. It also happens to be the most manual possible way to do that, so this lends itself to an important opportunity for optimization.
</p>
<p>
Before you can do something significant about anything, you have to name it. Otherwise it's like with Voldemort. <a href="http://humane-assessment.com/">Many winters ago</a>, I called the effort of “figuring the system out to know what to do next" assessment. And I claimed we should optimize development around it.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/assessment.png" alt="Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision">
	<figcaption>Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
For a whole decade my colleagues and I explored this idea. And it led us to what we now call moldable development.
</p>
<p>
What’s that?
</p>
<p>
Reading is the most manual way to extract information out of data. It does not scale and leads to incomplete information &amp; uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Software is hard enough. Not knowing what the current system is like should not be an acceptable variable in the equation. A hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering.
</p>
<p>
Once we accept that systems are data, it becomes obvious we should approach it like data, too. Data science tells us that you first start from the problem and then reason through a tool that matches the context.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/molding.png" alt="Tools should match the context">
	<figcaption>Tools should match the context</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
 As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems. To handle this, the key idea of moldable development is that the tool should be moldable after knowing the problem. In this way it can deal with what's important in context, and because of it, it can take care of the boring part of reading. Of course, for this to be practical, the cost of creating custom tools must be small.
</p>
<p>
I see the flow of constructing custom tools during development, and, ideally, for every single development problem, as the next major leap in software development.
</p>
<p>
In a decade from now, we should not be measuring the "figuring the system out” in terms of reading. We should occupy our energy with solving actual problems. To get there we should start by talking about how not to read code. We cannot afford not to.
</p>
<p>
We created <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to provide a concrete start for the "how not to read code" conversation. Glamorous Toolkit is a moldable development environment that makes it possible to create custom tools about software systems inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
So, go to <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">gtoolkit.com</a>. Play with it. Feel #MoldableDevelopment.
</p>
<p>
And do engage with us: <a href="https://discord.gg/FTJr9gP">discord.gg/FTJr9gP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s make that conversation happen.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Earlier this week, Twitter announced an initiative to combat misinformation on their platform that they call <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html">Birdwatch</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126122026/https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/overview/">How Birdwatch works</a>: Volunteers sign up (assuming they meet all the requirements) and can add notes to fill in context on misleading tweets. Other users can rate these contextual tweets as helpful or not helpful. All of these “notes” and ratings of notes are completely transparent.</p>











<p>At its face, Birdwatch is an attempt to scale up the existing fact-checking capability used during the 2020 U.S. Elections while also crowdsourcing this decision-making.</p>



<p>I will give Twitter credit for two things, and only two things, before I get into the problems with their design.</p>



<ol><li>They’re distributing the power to fact-check bad tweets to their users rather than hoarding it for themselves.</li><li>They correctly emphasized transparency as a goal for this tool.</li></ol>



<p>But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>



<h2>The Fatal Flaw of Birdwatch’s Design</h2>



<p>There’s an old essay titled <em><a href="https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/">The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security</a></em>, that immediately identifies two problems with Birdwatch’s design. They also happen to be the first two items on the essay’s list!</p>



<ol><li><strong>Default Permit</strong></li><li><strong>Enumerating Badness</strong></li></ol>



<p>This is best illustrated by way of example.</p>



<p>Let’s assume there are two pathological liars hellbent on spreading misinformation on Twitter. They each tweet unsubstantiated claims about some facet of government or civil service. Birdwatch users catch only one of them, and correctly fact-check their tweet.</p>



<p>What happens to the other liar?</p>



<p>What happens if Birdwatch users can only identify one out of ten liars? One out of a hundred? One out of a thousand?! Et cetera.</p>







<p>To be clear: The biggest flaw in their product design is simply that their “notes” and “fact-checks” are negative indicators on known-bad tweets.</p>



<p>This will create a dark pattern: If a tweet slips past the Birdwatch users’ radars, it won’t be fact-checked. In turn, users won’t realize it’s misinformation. A popular term for the resulting conduct is <strong>coordinated inauthentic behavior</strong>.</p>



<p>This already happens to YouTube.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PGm8LslEb4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Hell, this is already happening <em>to Twitter</em>:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-1RhQ1uuQ4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<h2>How To Fix Birdwatch</h2>



<p>I wrote an entire essay on <a href="https://medium.com/@soatok/defeating-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-at-scale-a872badf721">Defeating Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior at Scale</a> in 2019. I <em>highly</em> recommend anyone at Twitter interested in actually solving the misinformation problem to give that a careful consideration.</p>







<p>But in a nutshell, the most important fix is to change the state machine underlying Birdwatch from:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; trustworthy</li><li>Notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul>



<p>…to something <em>subtly</em> different:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; unvetted / be cautious</li><li>Notes -&gt;<ul><li>Negative notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul><ul><li>Positive notes -&gt; verified by experts</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>This effectively creates a traffic light signal for users: Tweets start as yellow (exercise caution, which is the default) and may become green (affirmed by notes) or red (experts disagree).</p>



<h3>What Would This Change Accomplish?</h3>



<p>Malicious actors that accomplish Birdwatch evasion will only manage to encompass their message in caution tape. (Metaphorically speaking, anyway.)</p>



<p>If their goal is to spread misinformation while convincing the recipients of their message that they’re speaking the truth, they’ll have to get a green light–which is ideally more expensive to accomplish.</p>



<h3>Bonus Round</h3>



<p>I would also recommend some kind of “this smells fishy” button to signal Birdwatch contributors that this tweet needs fact-checking. Users might self-select into filter bubbles that Birdwatch users are totally absent from, and in turn come across things that are completely unvetted and possibly ambiguous.</p>



<p>While I have your attention, here’s a quality of life suggestion, on the house:</p>



<p>Being able to link claims together (e.g. reposted images with a false claim, n.b. like how the minions memes on Facebook) to deduplicate their claims about reality would save a lot of unnecessary headache.</p>



<p>(Anyone who has used Stack Overflow will appreciate the utility of being able to say “this is a duplicate of $otherThing”.)</p>



<h2>What If These Fundamental Flaws Remain Unfixed?</h2>



<p>Although Birdwatch will probably meet the immediate goal of scaling up the fact-checking efforts beyond what Twitter can provide (and satisfy the public relations requirements of tangibly doing <em>something</em> to combat this problem), propagandists and conspiracy theorists will simply become incentivized to evade Birdwatch contributors’ detection while spreading their lies.</p>



<p>As I said above, coordinated inauthentic behavior is already happening. This isn’t some abstract threat that only academics care about.</p>



<p>To the aid of the malicious, most users will confuse tweets that evaded detection with tweets that didn’t warrant correction. This might even lead to users trusting misinformation <em>more</em> than they would before Birdwatch. This would be a total self-own for the entire Birdwatch project.</p>

<![CDATA[Fix Terminals]]>

January 27, 2021 | http://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pagebody">



<p>
Keyboard input on Terminals has many deficiencies to it. I want them all fixed. I have a plan on how to do it but it Needs Your Help
</p>

<p>
I want terminal keypresses to Just Work. What do I mean Just Work? I mean programs in a simple orthogonal way, can determine the key that was pressed, and this model should easily map to the user's expectation.
</p>

<p>
Why doesn't it currently? Currently, there are a number of classes of physically-distinct key presses that terminals encode using the same bytes.

</p><ul>
<li>Special names for some ASCII characters collide with <tt>Ctrl</tt>-modified letters. For example, <tt>Tab</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-I</tt>.</li>
<li>The <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier encodes lower or upper-case letters identically; <tt>Ctrl-I</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-Shift-I</tt>.</li>
<li>UTF-8 collides with 8bit-high characters; e.g. <tt>Alt-C</tt> might be encoded as <tt>0xc3</tt>, which is the first UTF-8 byte of many Unicode characters, such as Ã©.</li>
<li>Sometimes programs rely on timing information to distinguish, for example, <tt>Alt-C</tt> from the two separate keypresses of <tt>Escape</tt> followed by <tt>C</tt>. This results in delays to recognise a plain <tt>Escape</tt> key if the time is too long, or erroneously recognising <tt>Escape</tt> followed by a letter as an <tt>Alt</tt>-modified letter if typed too quickly, or if the time limit is too short.</li>
</ul><p>

Even when keys produce unique unambiguous byte sequences, it may be that some programs cannot recognise them.
</p><ul>
<li>The way terminals encode modified keypresses is an extension to the original methods used in the 1970s, and some older code cannot parse them correctly. Press <tt>Ctrl-Up</tt> on a modern xterm and watch a program fail and die in all sorts of interesting ways because they don't have real CSI parsers.</li>
</ul>



<h2>How can we fix this?</h2>

<p>
By having a sane and sensible model on BOTH ends of the terminal interaction, and a well-defined way of communicating.
How exactly we go about this really depends who you are:
</p>

<h3>Authors of Programs that Read Terminal Keypresses</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to go about this is to use the key input handling features of my terminal UI library, <a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtickit/">libtickit</a>.
Failing this, if you're using some existing system of keyboard input, such as GNU Readline, I suggest you apply pressure to the maintainers of that system until they adopt this method of reading extended keypresses.
</p>

<h3>Authors of Terminal Emulators</h3>

<p>
Making a terminal send the correct key encodings should be a relatively easy task, given the encoding scheme already splits modifiers and keysyms in a way likely to be similar to the underlying input system at work, such as X11 or Win32.
</p>

<h3>End-users of Programs</h3>

<p>Even if you're not the author of a program like this, you can still help fix the situation. Write to the maintainer of your program, report a bug. Explain that you wanted to use such a keybinding, or whatever the problem was. Explain that, because their program doesn't correctly handle these cases, it wasn't possible, but if they were to adopt this scheme, then it would be and your problem would be solved. With enough voices, even the most stubbon developer who believes it's 1970 and everyone lives behind a green-phosphor glass teletype on a 9,600 baud modem, can still change his ways.</p>

<h2>Encoding Specification</h2>

<p>
The primary motivation of this scheme is to encode any possible keypress uniquely; that a keypress maps to one possible sequence of bytes, and a valid sequence of bytes encodes only one keypress. For backward compability, it is also required that any keypress that can be represented without this scheme is also represented by the same bytes within it; that is, this scheme is an <em>extension</em> of existing encodings, not a replacement of.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Modifiers</dt>
<dd>
The two encoding forms used by this specification to encode modifiers both put a number as their second parameter whose value is 1 + a bitmask encoding the modifiers. We add 1 because by convention, a missing CSI parameter is equivalent to 1, so in the "unmodified" state the modifier field would be 1 - we must add 1 to it so that no-bits-set (unmodified) is encoded as 1 (though, in practice, we rarely use the 1 form explicitly).<br>

Thus, the various encoding forms using these modifiers will look like:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>unmodified</td><td>Shift+</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Alt+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+</td></tr>
<tr><td>(direct UTF-8)</td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 u</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI ... ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 ~</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;2 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;3 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;4 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;5 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;6 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;7 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;8 X</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
These various forms are explained more below.
</dd>

<dt>Unicode Characters</dt>
<dd>
When unmodified, just send UTF-8 bytes as normal. No UTF-8 sequence of a regular character starts with a <tt>C0</tt> or <tt>C1</tt> byte, so these will be unique. The <tt>Shift</tt> key should not be considered as a modifier for Unicode characters, because it is most likely used to obtain the character in the first place (e.g. the shift key is often required to obtain the <tt>!</tt> symbol).<br>

Certain key presses have special behaviours with modifiers. <tt>Alt</tt> tends to prefix <tt>Escape</tt>. <tt>Ctrl</tt> tends to mask with <tt>0x1f</tt>. When the simplest form of these keys are pressed, they should be encoded as previously.
Existing schemes lack a way to encode more general modifiers with Unicode codepoints at present, so we are at liberty to invent something new for these. The CSI <tt>u</tt> command lies in the private-use area, so has no fixed meaning at present.
<pre>CSI [codepoint];[modifier] u</pre>
We can use this to represent the problematic combinations of keys; for example variations on the letter "A" (ASCII decimal value 65) and "a":
<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><td>unmodified</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td></tr>
<tr><td>without Shift</td><td><tt>a</tt></td><td><tt>ESC a</tt></td><td><tt>0x01</tt></td><td><tt>ESC 0x01</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>with Shift</td><td><tt>A</tt></td><td><tt>ESC A</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;7 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
This same pattern is continued for the other letters, except for the awkward cases of 

We can now represent the usual problematic keys unambiguously:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-I = <tt>CSI 105;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-I = <tt>CSI  73;5 u</tt></td><td>Tab        = <tt>0x09</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-M = <tt>CSI 109;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-M = <tt>CSI  77;5 u</tt></td><td>Enter      = <tt>0x0d</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-[ = <tt>CSI  91;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-{       = <tt>CSI 123;5 u</tt></td><td>Escape     = <tt>0x1b</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Ctrl-@ = <tt>CSI  64;5u</tt></td>                                 <td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Because other <tt>C0</tt> bytes do not have usual alternative names or keypresses, these can continue to be sent using the simple single-byte encoding. This is essential to ensuring that legacy systems continue to interpret them correctly (e.g. <tt>termios</tt> still sends <tt>SIGINT</tt> on Ctrl-C).
The <tt>Space</tt> key is unique among the printing Unicode keys in that its behaviour doesn't normally change as a result of the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier. We can capture this by encoding it using CSIu - uniquely, the only printing Unicode key for which we use this:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI 32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Modified C0 controls</dt>
<dd>
The problematic keys listed above plus <tt>Backspace</tt> can be represented using the <tt>CSI u</tt> encoding when any modifiers are present. Because these symbols are almost universally found on their own physical keycap, there is no problem with encoding the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier as well, with the value 1. We encode these keys using their normal <tt>ASCII</tt> codepoint values.

<tbody><tr><td>Enter     = <tt>0x0d</tt></td><td>Shift-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;5 u</tt></td><td rowspan="4">...</td></tr>

<tr><td>Backspace = <tt>0x7f</tt></td><td>Shift-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;5 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
The <tt>Space</tt> key is trickier, because it's traditionally used with the <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier to obtain the <tt>NUL</tt> byte encoding.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Space     = <tt>0x20</tt></td><td>Shift-Space     = <tt>CSI  32;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Space     = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI  32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Since most terminals repesent <tt>Shift-Tab</tt> as <tt>CSI Z</tt>, that needs handling specially as well.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Tab = <tt>0x09</tt></td><td>Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI  Z</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Tab = <tt>CSI 9;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI 1;5 Z</tt></td><td>...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Special keys</dt>
<dd>
Existing schemes usually use <tt>CSI ~</tt> to encode special (i.e. non-Unicode) keypresses. XTerm and other terminals use the second CSI parameter to pass encoding the set of modifiers in effect.
<pre>CSI [number];[modifier] ~</pre>
If the modifier value is 1; i.e. there are no modifiers, then for backward-compatibility to send the same bytes as previously, it should be omitted, sending simply
<pre>CSI [number] ~</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Number</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Insert   </td><td> 2</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Delete   </td><td> 3</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Up  </td><td> 5</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Down</td><td> 6</td></tr>

 <tr><td>F11      </td><td>23</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F12      </td><td>24</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<b>(*)</b>: Note that some terminals prefer to encode <tt>Home</tt>, <tt>End</tt> and the <tt>F1</tt> to <tt>F4</tt> function keys using shorter <tt>CSI letter</tt> encodings. Parsers or other receiving programs should accept either encoding identically.
<b>(**)</b>: Note also the discontinuity of numbered function keys. After every group of 5 F keys there is a missing number; so every 6th number is not used by an F key (10, 16, 22, 28,...). This is purely for historic reasons; the numbered F keys on the original VTxx keyboards had physical gaps in these locations.
</dd>

<dt>Really special keypresses</dt>
<dd>
Some terminals encode certain keys outside of the <tt>CSI ~</tt> encoding, instead picking a different CSI command. This too can accomodate the modifier in its second position.
<pre>CSI 1;[modifier] {ABCDFHPQRS}</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Code</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Up</td>   <td>A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Down</td> <td>B</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Right</td><td>C</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Left</td> <td>D</td></tr>
 <tr><td>End</td>  <td>F</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Home</td> <td>H</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F1</td>   <td>P</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F2</td>   <td>Q</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F3</td>   <td>R</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F4</td>   <td>S</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
As before, if the modifier is 1 then the modifier parameter should be omitted. Since the leading number is also implied, this can be omitted too.
<pre>CSI {ABCDFHPQRS}</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Advantages: solves above problems. <b>Can be fitted into existing programs with a minimum of fuss and without breaking back-compat</b>.
</p>

<p>
Extension: We can take it one step further, and require CSI to be sent as the single 8bit code <tt>0x9b</tt> and never as 7bit multibyte <tt>0x1b 0x4b</tt> (Escape [). This reserves the single <tt>0x1b</tt> byte exclusively for the Escape key. If this is known to be in effect, then it is no longer required to use timing information to recover accurate keypress information, as every possible keypress now has a unique encoding. Even if this is not known to be in effect, programs ought to accept the single <tt>0x9b</tt> byte encoding of CSI anyway, in anticipation of a time when terminals may send it encoded this way by default.

Call to arms for idiomatic OO code <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/call-to-arms">here</a>.</em></p><p>People bash OO a lot these days, I'm increasingly coming to the opinion they're right, at least in Python. My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se, more that its introduction is simply unnecessary, AKA not useful.</p><h2>Oli's Conjecture</h2><blockquote>All OO code can be refactored into equivalent non-OO code that's as easy or more easy to understand.</blockquote><p>Let's take an example that should pan out in OO's favour, we've all seen/written code somewhat like the following:</p><pre><code>class ApiClient:
    def __init__(self, root_url: str, session_cls: sessionmaker):
        self.root_url = root_url
        self.session_cls = session_cls

    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/v1/{entity}"

    def get_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
        resp = requests.get(self.construct_url(entity))
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]

    def save_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; None:
        with scoped_session(self.session_cls) as session:
            session.add(self.get_items(entity))


class ClientA(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/{entity}"


class ClientB(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}"


client_a = ClientA("https://client-a", session_cls)
client_a.save_items("bars")</code></pre><p>We chose OO it because we wanted to bind the <code>root_url</code> to something and we didn't want to pass around the <code>sessionmaker</code>. We also wanted to utilise inheritance to hook into a method halfway through the call stack.</p><p>But what if we do just pass data around, and write 'boring' functions, what happens then?</p><pre><code>@dataclass
class Client:
    root_url: str
    url_layout: str


client_a = Client(
    root_url="https://client-a",
    url_layout="{root_url}/{entity}",
)

client_b = Client(
    root_url="https://client-b",
    url_layout="{root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}",
)


def construct_url(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; str:
    return client.url_layout.format(root_url=client.root_url, entity=entity)


def get_items(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
    resp = requests.get(construct_url(client, entity))
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]


def save_items(client: Client, session_cls: session_cls, entity: str) -&gt; None:
    with scoped_session(session_cls) as session:
        session.add(get_items(client, entity))


save_items(client_a, session_cls, "bars")</code></pre><p>We had to pass round the <code>Client</code> and the <code>session_cls</code> around.</p><p>ðŸ¤·</p><p>Who cares? We even wrote like 10% fewer characters. Also, the conjecture stands, the resulting code is at least as easy to understand and we didn't need any OO.</p><p>I've heard this style referred to as the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style. That is to say, all your code just consists of typed data and module-namespaced-bags-of-functions.</p><h2>What about long lived global-y things?</h2><p>Use <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/sane-config.html">this pattern</a> to reuse config/db session classes over the lifetime of an application.</p><h2>What about interfaces/abstract base classes?</h2><p>Just try writing without them, I promise it's going to be OK. <em>(To be fair, it's only the introduction of type hints to Python that has made the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style so pleasant).</em></p><h2>What about impure things?</h2><p>If you've taken the pure-FP/hexagonal-architecture pill, you want to write pure classes that take impure 'adapter' instances for <code>getting-the-current-datetime/API-calls/talking-to-the-db/other-impure-stuff</code>. The idea is nice in principal - should be good for testing right? - in practice, you can just use <a href="https://github.com/spulec/freezegun">freezegun</a> / use <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/responses">responses</a> / <a href="https://dhh.dk/2014/slow-database-test-fallacy.html">test with the db</a> (the <code>other-impure-stuff</code> tends to not actually exist) and save yourself a lot of hassle.</p><h2>Exceptions:</h2><p>I'd like to make exceptions for the following:</p><ul><li>You'll notice I put <code>@dataclass</code>s in the refactored code, these are fine - they're just record types. Python 5 will only have these, not 'normal' classes.</li><li>It's fine to subclass <code>Exception</code>s.  The usage of <code>try: ... except SomeClass: ...</code> fundamentally ties you to a heirarchical worldview, this is fine, just don't make it too complicated.</li><li><code>Enum</code>s - same as above, they fit in well with the rest of Python.</li><li>Very, very occasionally (at least in application development), you come up with a core type that's used so often, it's nice to have the cutesy stuff - think something like a <code>pandas.DataFrame</code>/<code>sqlalchemy.Session</code>. In general though, don't kid yourself that you're building anything that exciting, it's just vanity getting the better of you.</li></ul><h2>I lied.</h2><blockquote>My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se.</blockquote><p>OK, I lied, it's not just a case of OO being a largely futile addition to the language, it's that it often obscures the problem at hand and encourages bad behaviours:</p><ul><li>It encourages you to mutate. Bag-of-functions makes it feel icky to mutate arguments - as it should feel. (Feel free to mutate within the confines of your function BTW, let's not go mad FP).</li><li>It's somewhat just the return of global variables. Not being able to share data between functions with <code>self</code> forces you to write functions with a smaller state-space that are easier to test.</li><li>Smooshing in functions in with your data makes it harder to serialise anything - in a world of REST APIs, serialisability is super useful.</li><li>It encourages mad inheritance hierarchies - this has been talked about at length elsewhere.</li><li>Most importantly though, it adds nothing, it's just noise that distracts from the problem at hand and makes it harder to navigate/comprehend your code.</li></ul><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li><a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/poor-mans-object.html">I've written before about the poor man's object/closure thingy.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0">A classic video in the OO-bashing genre.</a></li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOCs</a>. Theyâ€™re great for trying to learn a new programming language (e.g., Python, Scala) or framework (e.g., Spark, TensorFlow) or subject (e.g., statistics, machine learning). The structured learning environment, excellent teaching, and exercises (and solutions) guide us through the best way to learn new concepts.</p>
<p><strong>But most of the time, we donâ€™t really need it.</strong> If we <em>already</em> know machine learning, taking that shiny new MOOC wonâ€™t help with applying it more effectively. Doing another Python tutorial wonâ€™t help with writing better code. Most MOOCs follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a> and teach students the 20% they need to achieve 80% results. Thus, past the first or second course, our learning tapers off. (Also see Susanâ€™s view on <a href="https://www.susanshu.com/should-i-take-more-online-courses-data-science#rule-of-thumb-diminishing-marginal-returns" target="_blank">diminishing returns</a>.)</p><p>
\[\text { Diminishing returns from similar MOOCs }=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots \approx 2\]
</p><p><strong>Sometimes, new MOOCs become a reason to procrastinate, or worse, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping" target="_blank">self-handicap</a>.</strong> You know this is happening when you hear yourself, or something else, having these thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>â€œIâ€™m not able to start building that <em>until</em> I finish this MOOC specialization.â€�</li>
<li>â€œMy resume isnâ€™t getting picked up <em>because</em> I donâ€™t have certs on Spark &amp; PyTorch.â€�</li>
<li>â€œI havenâ€™t studied enough about deep learning, <em>so</em> I wonâ€™t do well in the interview.â€�</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watching lecture videos isnâ€™t learningâ€”itâ€™s passive consumption.</strong> We sometimes equate taking an MOOC, or reading a technical book cover to cover, with learning the material. But how often do we struggle when we try to apply the technical knowledge or skills at work? Children donâ€™t learn to ride bicycles via how-to videos. Similarly, we canâ€™t learn how to program or apply technical knowledge just solely watching videos.</p>
<h2 id="go-off-the-happy-path">Go off the happy path</h2>
<p>Most good MOOCs or tutorials will provide hands-on practice. However, that hands-on practice will lie on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path" target="_blank">happy path</a>. We can copy-paste the code and itâ€™ll work. This makes sense as thereâ€™s a lot of material to cover and we donâ€™t want to spend time debugging, doing prep work, or solving problems via trial and error. Students will lose patience, causing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/60e90be2-1a77-11e9-b191-175523b59d1d" target="_blank">completion rates to drop</a>.</p>
<p>Being on the happy path makes it easier to complete MOOC after MOOC. However, when we try to apply what weâ€™ve learnedâ€”either at work or on a personal projectâ€”it becomes much harder. This is because weâ€™re <em>now</em> off the happy path. And this is a good thing!</p>
<p><strong>Going off the happy path is how we further our learning <em>beyond the classroom</em>.</strong> This is especially so for our field of data science and machine learning, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-world data is messy and dirty, but most MOOCs or YouTube classes start with clean, structured data.</li>
<li>Most of the skills we require are technical. Thus, hands-on coding (read: <a href="https://danluu.com/teach-debugging/" target="_blank">debugging</a>) is essential to master them.</li>
<li>Experimentation is fundamental in our field. We need to try different approaches, fail, and learn beyond what can be practically taught in an MOOC or online tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œI hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.â€� â€“ Confucius</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We go off the happy path by doing real-world projects</strong>, dirty data, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cuda+errors" target="_blank">CUDA errors</a>, and all. Through projects, we learn how to define problems, apply algorithms wrongly (and correctly), google error messages, and iterate until it works. We practice resourcefulness, grit, and how to learn. These are the lessons that push us towards excellence.</p>
<p>But, I donâ€™t know enough to start a personal project!</p>
<h2 id="just-in-time-learning">Just-in-time learning</h2>
<p><strong>You just need to know enough to start; the rest youâ€™ll pick up along the way.</strong> We donâ€™t need to know Python <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" target="_blank">generators</a> before developing your first Python program. We donâ€™t need to know Spark before processing 2 million rows of data. We donâ€™t need to know TensorFlow before training your first machine learning model.</p>
<p><strong>Just start, and let the challenges guide you towards your next learning needs.</strong> This way, you immediately apply what youâ€™ve learned. This reinforces learning, improves retention, and increases satisfaction. Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing" target="_blank">just-in-time</a> manufacturing, just learn whateverâ€™s needed to make progress on your project. Technical skills are perishableâ€”if we donâ€™t apply what we learn, theyâ€™ll decay.</p>
<p><strong>Apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" target="_blank">YAGNI</a> to learning.</strong> Just like we donâ€™t need to add functionality until itâ€™s required, we donâ€™t need to do every new MOOC or read every new textbook. No point overwhelming ourselves with all that information and knowledge which we wonâ€™t use or apply.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to become expert at thing:<br>1 iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning â€œon demandâ€� (ie donâ€™t learn bottom up breadth wise)<br>2 teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words<br>3 only compare yourself to younger you, never to others</p>— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1325154823856033793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2020</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>To be clear, Iâ€™m not saying that we should stop exploring and learning new things. Iâ€™m saying that we should lean towards being more focused.</p>
<p>When learning about new domains, subjects, or skills, adopt a childlike <em>exploratory</em> mindset. Donâ€™t concern ourselves with the practicality of what we learn. However, if our intent is mastery, we should adopt a <em>focused</em> mindset and learn via hands-on projects, mistakes, and feedback.</p>
<h2 id="but-but-here-are-my-reasons-for-_____">But, butâ€¦ here are my reasons for _____</h2>
<p>I often get pushback when I suggest doing a personal project instead of another MOOC, Kaggle, or further education. Hereâ€™s how some conversations go:</p>
<p><strong>â€œIâ€™m very time-constrained and donâ€™t have time for a personal project. MOOCs are self-contained and need only 2-4 hours a weekâ€�</strong></p>
<p>Yes, MOOCs are great return on time-invested for getting up to speed on a subject. But past a certain threshold of knowledge and understanding, youâ€™re going to need hands-on practice to take your learning further. AFAIK, projects are the best way to do this.</p>
<p><strong>â€�I tried doing a personal project in the past. But I got a lot of errors and had to google a lotâ€”I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ready for them until I do more MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Getting errors and googling for help is perfectly normal! Even the instructors who created those MOOCs do that too. Thatâ€™s how we learnâ€”by trying, failing, and overcoming.</p>
<p><strong>â€�Personal projects are too difficult. Taking an MOOC is easier.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Thatâ€™s exactly why you need to do a personal project. The difficulty you experience is the learning curveâ€”without it, thereâ€™s no learning.</p>
<p>MOOCs <em>feel</em> easier because their tutorials and assignments are structured to follow the happy path. But this means youâ€™re deliberately steered away from the hairy issues that youâ€™ll face in the real world, unlike in a personal project.</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/mooc-jackie.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Why I can't serve ML models?!" alt="Why I can't serve ML models?!"></p>
<p><strong>â€�Doing that MOOC/Masters gives me a certificate that helps my resume.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. Nonetheless, companies are placing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html" target="_blank">less emphasis on educational qualifications</a>, even for technical roles. Recruiters and hiring managers are also becoming more open-minded. And in the end, from a hiring managerâ€™s perspective, what <em>really</em> counts is if you can do the work, not that cert.</p>
<p><strong>â€�The recruiter said I would be tested on technical skills and knowledge. Thus, I need to do more technical MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>To an extent, MOOCs and YouTube videos are helpful, especially for questions that test your knowledge (read: memory) or require you to know the trick (e.g., leetcode type questions).</p>
<p>However, for most interviews, youâ€™ll likely get more nebulous tasks, like designing a data pipeline, whiteboarding a machine learning API, or coding up a basic k-nearest neighbors or decision tree. These assess your ability to design and develop maintainable systems, think through edge cases, and adapt based on feedback. The hands-on practice from projects will be more helpful in such interviews</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/interview-board.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Lets just focus on the easy questions" alt="Lets just focus on the easy questions"></p>
<p><strong>â€�What personal project should I do?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Start with something youâ€™re interested in. If youâ€™re not intrinsically interested in it, you might find difficulty finishing.</p>
<p>Aim for something you can complete over the weekends in 12 weeks, ideally, 6 - 8 weeks. Any longer and it wonâ€™t seem urgent enough (and youâ€™ll lose momentum).</p>
<p><strong>â€�Iâ€™m familiar with web scraping/ruby/excel, can my personal project be about that?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Just start somewhere and evolve it along the way.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if youâ€™re doing a personal project to learn, youâ€™ll probably want to deliberately pick something new and unfamiliar. Or if youâ€™re doing a personal project to build your portfolio (and get a job), youâ€™ll want to look over the job requirements to make sure you address them.</p>
<p><strong>â€�But, I canâ€™t think of any interesting personal projects!â€�</strong></p>
<p>Look back on the classes and material youâ€™ve covered. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find something interesting that youâ€™ll want to dig deeper into.</p>
<p>This is also a good test of whether youâ€™re interested in a discipline. If you canâ€™t think of a personal project that interests you, do you <em>really</em> want it for a career? (And the answer might be yes, for various reasons such as compensation, prestige, etc.)</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/project-drake.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Do a personal project? Nah..." alt="Do a personal project? Nah..."></p>
<p><strong>â€�Other than personal projects, anything else you would recommend?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Nope. My <em>sole</em> recommendation is to start a personal project and learn whatever you need to complete it.</p>
<p>â€¢ â€¢ â€¢</p>
<p>In 2021, instead of taking that MOOC or watching another YouTube machine learning playlist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing" target="_blank">learn by doing</a> instead.</p>
<p>Learning a programming language? Build an app, any app. Share it online and get feedback. Iterate and add new features. Learning a new machine learning technique? Find some novel data and apply it. Understand where it fails, where it shines, and how to adapt it for different data sets. Share your findings via writing online or at a meetup.</p>
<p>Learning comes from doing. Not watching videos, or reading textbooks. Start doing now.</p>

These questions can range from simple customer support queries ("Does user X have the right plan?") to evaluating KPI's and growth metrics ("How many users signed up in the last month and what percent of those converted to paid?") to the more open-ended ("How much revenue will we have in 12 months?").</span></span></p><div id="block-3e9cd828f5334adda85fdbfb4b4cc69a"><div id="block-71f39a4ef039454287b8caa8e53eea89"><p><span><span>To make my job easier, I try to automate as many of these questions as I can. My company, </span><span><a href="https://seekwell.io/blog-gpt3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SeekWell</a></span><span>, builds awesome tools to help with this, like a unified team SQL repository and seamless scheduling of queries, reports, and alerts. Many things, though, like actually writing SQL code, are difficult to automateâ€”or at least have been. </span></span></p></div><div id="block-05f0094e96104a55b608aecb7c35791b"><div id="block-fd67e43c00754a16b725e54946093bb4"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/74a62dc5-b3f1-45ba-a090-36e1f21cd166.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div><h3 id="block-f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"><span id="f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"></span><span><span>Enter GPT-3</span></span></h3><p><span><span><a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Openai</a></span><span>'s </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3</a></span><span> is starting to break the conventional wisdom of what tasks can and can't be automated. At the most basic level, GPT-3 is a text-completion engine, trained on huge swaths of the internet. It takes inputted text and returns the text that it thinks would appear next. Many have already used it to generate HTML and CSS </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a></span><span> from specific design instructions. Others have made </span><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1 trending blog posts</a></span><span> generated mostly by GPT-3 with some creative prompts.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In my case, since so much of my job is writing SQL, I want to be able to describe a question in plain English and have GPT-3 convert it into the SQL code that, if executed on my Postgres database, would answer the question. </span></span></p><p><span><span>To accomplish this, I found more success using </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/the-instruct-series-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3 Instruct</a></span><span> (still in beta) than the more generalized GPT-3 engines. GPT-3 Instruct (in particular,</span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground?model=davinci-instruct-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> davinci-instruct</a></span><span>) lets you give specific instructions, like "Only respond in correct SQL syntax", that guides GPT-3's responses. If you're interested in trying it out, you can sign up for the waitlist for the GPT-3 API </span><span><a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1Lfc7WtPLRk2ppXhPjcYY-A4sk30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span><span>. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Below, I'll detail my experience with the API. In each example, I'll include a gif of asking GPT-3 a question. Below the gif will be the input question (generated by me, in green) and GPT-3's response translating it into SQL (generated by GPT-3, in blue). I'll also include my instructions to GPT-3 (in yellow) and examples I fed GPT-3 (in orange). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Here's the first instruction I gave it, a question, and the response from GPT-3:</span></span></p><div id="block-48ecab24b59a4404bae7f20fb8caf501"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/d99a5fe5-1ca9-43f2-a233-818d878160ac.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how many users signed up in the past month?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response: </strong></span><span>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
WHERE signup_time &gt; now() - interval '1 month'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Woah. I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called "users" (which is accurate) and that there's a timestamp field called "signup_time" for when a user signed up. Pretty logical. It also knew the correct way to subtract a month from today's date in PostgreSQL (now() - interval '1 month') without seeing an example. Pretty cool!</span></span></p><p><span><span>To give GPT-3 a little more context, I'll add information about my database schema to the instruction. My new Instruction: </span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct. Only use tables called "users" and "charges". The "users" table has columns: id (integer), signup_dt (timestamp), email (character varying), and plan_type (character varying). The "charges" table has columns: amount (bigint), user_id (integer), and charge_dt (timestamp).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now I'll try asking another question, and see if GPT-3 can respond based on my actual database:</span></span></p><div id="block-a4da842d10ee45bdaee9837e612a0afb"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/85ecbb57-3212-4ebd-8d13-534d98573a64.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue did we have in the past 7 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; now() - interval '7 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Nice. I gave it a little more information on the tables and columns in my database, and it correctly inferred that "amount" = "revenue" and knew to SUM() that amount for the past 7 days of charges to answer the question. Clearly, it already knows some basic SQL syntax, and can make inferences about what I mean.</span></span></p><h3 id="block-77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"><span id="77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"></span><span><span>Priming GPT-3 with examples</span></span></h3><p><span><span>I'll try another question but first it might make sense to explicitly tell GPT-3 the columns in my tables via a simple example. Examples are a great way to give GPT-3 context and flesh out subtleties that might not be obvious in just an instruction. I found this helpful for really hammering into it which columns and tables are eligible to use (GPT-3 sometimes likes to "invent" columns to make answering the question easier). Here are the examples I added to the prompt:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from users table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT id, signup_dt, email, plan_type FROM users</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from charges table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT amount, user_id, and charge_dt FROM charges</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now with those examples fed to GPT-3, I'll ask another question:</span></span></p><div id="block-58c943723b154475bf698435c315d98d"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/b349a134-f123-4451-bee0-b1ab88b3a3dc.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> what was the largest payment amount made in the past 30 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>It knew to use MAX(amount) to get the largest payment and set the date condition correctly without seeing an example on how to subtract a number of days from the current date. It's doing pretty well, but let's try something a little trickier now, using the same instruction and examples:</span></span></p><div id="block-1af088fb733248dc82c23d45d4f90707"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/bc58b0bf-c5ab-46c6-903c-989e2d5bd0c0.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make his last payment?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(charge_dt) FROM charges WHERE user_id = 1 AND email = 'brian@seekwell.io'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Okay, not </span><span><em>quite </em></span><span>right. The "charges" table doesn't have a column for email, so this query would fail. I also never said the user with email = "brian@seekwell.io" has user_id = 1â€”don't know where it got that idea from. To answer the question correctly, you would have to join the "charges" table with the "users" table since only "users" has an email column. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Since it's a big leap to know to join those tables on </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id (even if that seems perfectly logical to a human analyst), I'll give GPT-3 an example of a "join" so it has something to go off of:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did jane</span><span><a href="mailto:mike@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make her first payment?

New examples:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input: </strong></span><span>how many users signed up in the past 30 days?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE signup_dt &gt;= now() - interval '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>I</span><span><strong>nput:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> sign up?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It’s 2021, and data fetching on the web still sucks. This is crazy!</p>
<p>If you’re building a web app at scale you have plenty of options for data management:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fetch</code>, <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code>, etc. (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/falcor">Falcor</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay">Relay</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js">Protobuf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node">gRPC</a></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>But none of these do everything well. What do you need to do well to be a good data fetching library?</p>
<h2>Fetching Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when fetching data</strong>. When your app fetches new data, the UI should automatically update everywhere that data is used.</li>
<li><strong>Request batching</strong>. When multiple requests are made at the same time, they should be combined into one request, when reasonable, to avoid hitting browser-imposed concurrency limits.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding network waterfalls</strong>. When fetching data for a component, you should make one request that includes data for all its descendents too, to avoid lots of network round trips. GraphQL solves this with fragments, but it’s still painful in modern clients (eg. Relay does this by requiring you  manually compose fragments up the React tree so they’re fetched together, then pass fragment pointers down the tree to tell Relay where to look for fetched data; it also requires a compilation step).</li>
<li><strong>UX when fetching data</strong>. It’s a big burden for engineers to have to manually add loading spinners and error states, and engineers often forget.</li>
<li><strong>Colocation</strong>. You should declare data dependencies close to where they’re used, ideally in the same file. Same principle as colocating CSS with your components.</li>
<li><strong>File size</strong>. You shouldn’t have to ship kilobytes of metadata describing your data schema to clients in order to fetch data.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. Your code should know what type of data it got from the server.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updating your data model should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime updates</strong>. Sometimes, you want data to be pushed, not pulled (eg. for things like notifications). But the APIs for pushing and pulling data are often different, both on the client and on the server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when updating data</strong>. When you update a piece of data, your data fetching library should automatically refetch dependent data that will change after the request completes (eg. if you update <code>Person.FirstName</code>, <code>Person.FullName</code> should automatically be refetched).</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic updates</strong>. The UI should optimistically render the success state before a server response comes back, if there’s a high chance the request will succeed. This makes your UI feel snappy and fun to use. Today’s data fetching libraries make this a lot of manual work.</li>
<li><strong>Request queueing</strong>. Requests that depend on one another need to be queued; independent requests can be sent in parallel. Otherwise, network weather and server queuing can cause your client to end up in a state that’s inconsistent with the server.</li>
<li><strong>UX when updating data</strong>. Product engineers shouldn’t need to manually render loading spinners and success and error notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Durability when updating data</strong>. Exponential backoff for retrying idempotent requests and idempotence tokens for network failures; eager persistance to disk for client/server failures.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. You shouldn’t be able to send invalid input to the server, for some definition of invalid.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updates to your mutation APIs should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I think the reason this hasn’t been solved is it’s a hard problem that’s at the intersection of a bunch of fast-moving technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming languages (to infer what data depends on what)</li>
<li>Databases (client-side stores are small databases)</li>
<li>Server APIs and protocols (REST, GraphQL, RPC, etc.)</li>
<li><s>UI frameworks</s> (at this point, React has won)</li>
<li>User experience and perceived performance</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, every attempt at solving data fetching has either tightly coupled all of these layers, leading to trouble gaining mass adoption (think <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>); other solutions have tackled just one layer, ignoring the rest. This smells to me like the abstractions &amp; APIs for each layer are wrong: you shouldn’t need tight coupling to solve data fetching. Instead, you need better abstractions.</p>
<p>Is this a problem that can be solved?</p>

          <div>
            <p>Over the past year I’ve used web technologies to create audio games like soundStrider and participate in numerous game jams.
With syngen I’m releasing my tools as open-source so folks can join me in crafting dynamic audio experiences and games for the web.
Continue reading to dive into its features, view example code, and learn more about its future.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>syngen is a game engine and synthesis toolkit that specializes in creating audio games with fully synthesized sounds.
If you’ve played any of my games before, then you might be familiar with its capabilities.</p>

<p>It provides a light wrapper around the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Web Audio API</a> with tools for building synths and positioning them as props on a three-dimensional binaural soundstage.
Its event loop fires each frame to update props and core systems.
Additional utilities provide tools for engineering custom systems that hook into its API to deliver rich experiences.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wrapper for the Web Audio API with a domain-specific API</li>
  <li>Event-driven main loop and core systems</li>
  <li>Interfaces and utilities for building custom sounds and systems</li>
  <li>Binaural processing to position sounds on a realistic stage</li>
  <li>Virtualized mixer for advanced signal routing and mastering</li>
  <li>Built-in synthesizers, effects, and global reverb send</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">clone the repository</a> or install with your favorite package manager:</p>



<p>The library <em>must</em> be used within a browser environment so it can access the <code>window</code> object.
You may <code>require('syngen')</code> as a UMD module, or include <code>dist/syngen.min.js</code> to assign it to the <code>syngen</code> global.</p>

<h3 id="example-usage">Example usage</h3>
<p>This example demonstrates how to define a prop and instantiate one on the soundstage.
Here you’ll hear a relatively loud sine tone playing Middle C, centered in the stereo field:</p>

  <span>},</span>
  <span>onDestroy</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>synth</span><span>.</span><span>stop</span><span>()</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>})</span>

<span>const</span> <span>instance</span> <span>=</span> <span>syngen</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>prototype</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

</ul>

<h2 id="the-future-of-syngen">The future of syngen</h2>
<p>This initial release reflects a year of learning with game development.
It contains some assumptions and vestiges that have remained since I first started this journey.
For this reason it’s been released as version 0.1.0 to indicate that it’s experimental and to be used at your own risk in production.
Hopefully the examples above demonstrate the rewards of that gamble.</p>

<p>Because I have games in production on this release branch, it needs to remain backwards compatible.
Therefore, minor version bumps and patch releases will only contain new features and bug fixes.
If it ever reaches the 1.0.0 milestone, then that will indicate a stabilization of this current API.</p>

<p>What I would like to do in a 2.0.0 release branch is reflect on my previous assumptions to rework it entirely.
This might include simplifications and optimizations that improve its power and usability.
Ideally it would empower me to build a new generation of audio games beyond what I’ve thought possible and learned this past year.</p>

<p>Please reach out or <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen/issues" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a> if you encounter any bugs or have any questions or projects to share.
I’m excited to hear your creations!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><div><p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/ethical-dairy-system">ethical dairy model</a> is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.</p></div></div>
<div>
  <div><div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>In traditional dairy farms calves are removed from their mothers within a few hours of their birth - the stress this places on the cow is clear. So we wanted to find a way to keep calves with the cows and still have a financially viable farm. Put simply, we don’t want to have to choose between doing what’s right and staying in business.</p>
<p>As an organic dairy farm for more than twenty years our cows have already benefitted from some of the highest welfare standards in the UK, but we knew we could do even better. We built a new dairy, specially designed to house calves with their mothers, and we trialled the full cow with calf system for the first time in 2012. It taught us a lot, but financially cost us an awful lot.</p>
<p><span>However, the impact it made on cow contentment was staggering. All the animals were noticeably calmer and far more confident. <span>&nbsp;</span>After two to three months the calves became like teenagers, they loved playing with their pals and really only came back to mum when they wanted food!</span></p>
<p><span></span>We are determined to make our radical new model of dairy farming work, and by purchasing cheese from The Ethical Dairy you are helping to support it.</p>
</div></div></div>  </div>

          <h2>The Ethical Journey So Far</h2>

</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>Since October 2016 our calves have stayed with their mothers for 5 to 6 months. We still milk them in that period, but only once a day.</p>
<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotics</a>, increases in <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> and <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/healthier-winter">healthier</a>, happier cows. Compared to an average dairy farm, already The Ethical Dairy has:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/coo-poo-power">energy</a> use by more than half</li>
<li>Cut <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotic</a> use by 90%</li>
<li>Cut agro-chemical use by 90%</li>
<li>Doubled the productive life of cows</li>
<li>Increased our farm <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> five-fold</li>
<li>Increased the net amount of food in our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/politics-food-production">food system</a> by 80%</li>
<li>Exceeded the highest standards of animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethical Dairy has been supported in its journey by many individuals through our crowdfunding campaign in the autumn of 2018, and by public funding, such as Dumfries and Galloway LEADER which is helping us to attend trade shows, events, and to market and promote our products. We are also grateful for support from the Food Processing, Manufacturing and Cooperation grant which has supported the development of our new cheese dairy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our cheese and we thank you for your support of The Ethical Dairy.</p>

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/hermetic_world.jpg" alt="The world description from an hermetic point of view was always convoluted and full of retrospective to enforce meaning" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>The year of the Linux desktop is coming</em>, and it looks like a piñata of
micro-services. Let’s break it and see the candies inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>systemd core — the building block framework abstracting basic functionalities</li>
  <li>A universal package manager with a single reposotiry where anyone can push</li>
  <li>flatpak/appimage/snap — containarized applications</li>
  <li>polkit and apparmor — granular security</li>
  <li>systemd-homed — movable home with an immutable base system</li>
  <li>wayland compositors — the graphical environment</li>
  <li>pipewire — media pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re bored you can leave now, that’s it. Otherwise, let me get more
ideas out, but nothing surprising to anyone that has been following RedHat,
the freedesktop.org, and systemd.</p>

<p>The key innovation of the picture I lay above is that every
layer in the system is now isolated and communicate with one
another through d-bus services. D-bus is <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">fantastic in its own
right</a> and good at
abstracting functionalities.</p>

<p>All of these pieces need one another. Wayland compositors need pipewire
to be able to access media hardware, and pipewire needs polkit (or
similar mechanism) to select who can do that. Similarly, containarized
applications access the rest of the system through systemd services,
polkit, and pipewire.</p>

<p>What this leads to is a base system that is stable, a solid framework
to build on. The home is transportable inside a systemd-homed, along
with the containarized apps, proprietary or not.</p>

<p>The deep secret insider info I got tells me that this is a giant scheme
to get us all in a vendor lock-in. I can lie, this is the internet.<br>
Or better (or worse?), this is a new Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Who’s going to nag when this is all done in the open; when the open
source movers are the implementers of the de-facto implementations;
when they keep piling the standards until nobody can follow them.</p>

<p>I believe the direction the Linux desktop is going towards will
bring more incentives for investments. Distributions uniqueness
won’t matter anymore as they’ll be centralized around a “store”
where devs will push directly. (<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/03/29/distro-pkgs.html">see previous post about distros
roles</a>)</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you weren’t aware of this vision of how distros will
look in the future.</p>

</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best description of the project is on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">the home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is our upgrade path from <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> to a better language and runtime.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a popular cluster manager from Google (released around 2014),
has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>

</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>

POSIX is silent.</li>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="576" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png 536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></figure></div>



<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>What are amulets? How are they situated in the larger narrative of European healing? Varied and complex objects, amulets present both challenges and opportunities for historians and museums alike. Yet an examination of these often-overlooked items within a medical context can provide significant information about cure and protection over different times and geographies. This article analyses ten amulets from the Science Museum collections, and asks what we can learn from exploring these objects’ material features and varying functions. It argues for a re-consideration of amulets from their categorisation by nineteenth- and twentieth-century collectors and classification by modern museums, to their recognition as a significant part of the history of healing.</p>

<h2>Introduction – a hare’s foot and a Billiken</h2>


<p>On his way home from running errands one morning in January 1665, Samuel Pepys stopped to buy a hare. Pepys was a Member of Parliament and administrator of the Navy, and is perhaps most famous for keeping a diary for almost a decade during his younger life. A few weeks earlier, despite ‘very cold weather’ he had celebrated a phase of good health, unsure whether to attribute it to his daily pill of turpentine, the fact that he had ‘left off the wearing of a gowne’, or simply his ‘hare’s foote’. Yet this good health did not last. The new year brought burning, pimples and pricks, bladder problems, headaches and ‘a great deal of pain’ to Pepys’ body (<a href="#reference-60">Pepys; Wheatley (ed), 1893</a>).<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> On this January morning, however, he had run into an acquaintance at Westminster Hall – Sir William Batten, Member of Parliament and surveyor to the Navy (<a href="#reference-59">Pepys, Latham (ed), 2003, p xlv</a>).<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Batten had given Pepys medical advice regarding his latest ailment, a most painful bout of colic, for which he showed Pepys the mistake he had made with the hare’s foot and guaranteed the perfect modification to his remedy. Originally, the foot had not been cut properly, and ‘hath not the joynt to it’; this was where the problem lay.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> Eager to try anything to alleviate his swollen belly and ‘grudgings of wind’, Pepys handled Batten’s correctly cut hare’s foot, and noted in wonder:</p>
<p>[Batten] assures me he never had his cholique since he carried it about him: and it is a strange thing how fancy works, for I no sooner almost handled his foote but my belly began to be loose and to break wind, and whereas I was in some pain yesterday and t’other day and in fear of more to-day, I became very well, and so continue.<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The next day, having obtained a new animal and taken Batten’s advice, Pepys was finally convinced: ‘To my office till past 12, and then home to supper and to bed, being now mighty well, and truly I cannot but impute it to my fresh hare’s foote.’<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> One thing was clear; the hare’s foot had worked. Pepys was cured of colic.</p>

        <p>Amulet One – Hare’s foot, object number A666124</p>
        
    
    
</section>
<p>This object is not unfamiliar to us. This particular hare’s foot, which forms part of the Science Museum’s amulet collection, is originally from Norfolk and dated 1870–1920, but hares’ and rabbits’ feet can still be bought as ‘lucky charms’ and are widely available on the internet.<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Populist literature similarly continues to reference the use of these items; <em>Scientific American</em> published an article on ‘What Makes a Rabbit’s Foot Lucky’ in 2011 (<a href="#reference-19">D’Costa, 2011</a>). Such objects remain a part of popular culture – that is, part of recognised cultural traditions – over three hundred years after being employed by Pepys. Yet we can observe a shift in function. In Pepys’ world, the various elements that constituted sickness and health were broad and wide-ranging. Illness, like health, could be affected by an extensive range of things from an imbalance of the bodily humours, environmental factors such as sleep, food, emotions and exercise, supernatural or preternatural forces, and even the stars.<a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a> Whilst Pepys sometimes consulted learned medical practitioners, the variety of people from whom he could seek counsel was extensive. In this case, he took the advice of his friend Sir William Batten.<a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a> Pepys’ story is part of a larger narrative of healing in which learned medicine, religion, astrology, magic, fate and fortune all played a role. As part of healing, objects could be invested with power from any one or more of these various sources, and employed to cure or protect. These objects have often been called amulets, both historically and today, although our interpretation of them has changed over time. The healing potency of amulets has not always been entirely understood, and their means of operation often hidden from comprehension. Yet within their own contexts, this functional complexity has not detracted from the items’ curative or protective effects. The narrative of healing that included amulets continued throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and only when modern medicine necessitated ‘scientific’, empiric evidence of the mechanisms of objects’ efficacy did this change. In other words, amulets were relegated from the domain of authorised healing once it became a requirement to know and explain <em>how</em> cures worked, not just that they <em>did</em> work.</p>
<div><p>The word ‘amulet’ originates from the Latin ‘amulētum’, and was used by Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) to denote an item worn on the body for therapeutic, apotropaic or exorcistic benefit (Skemer, 2006, pp 6–7). Whilst many have noted the belief that the word can be traced back to Arabic, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has refuted this (<a href="#reference-56">OED, 2018, ‘amulet’</a>). Whilst definitions vary, ‘charm’ is often used synonymously with ‘amulet’, whilst ‘talisman’ features less frequently. For instance, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford has implied a semantic similarity between ‘amulets’ and ‘charms’, noting that an amulet is defined by the OED as: ‘Anything worn about the person as a charm preventative against evil, mischief, disease, witchcraft, etc.’, whilst a charm is described as ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity’ – ‘though a charm may also be a spell or incantation believed to have a magical power’ (<a href="#reference-61">Pitt Rivers Museum, 2017</a>). ‘Amulets’ and ‘charms’ are also used synonymously by the Horniman Museum in London, and the Oxford English Dictionary’s definitions further allude to this; one entry noting that a charm is ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity; an amulet’ (<a href="#reference-39">Horniman Museum, 2017</a>).<a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a></p><p>Evidently, amulets cannot be easily and simply defined, in part because the ways in which they have been used and understood have changed from antiquity to today. What, then, is the defining feature which makes an object an amulet? The answer to this is, its power. In the most basic and fundamental way, amulets are invested with the potency to heal. Healing centres around cure and protection, but where once these two actions were closely related, now they are more distinct. Historically, healing has not been monolithic and has taken many forms, relating to and deriving from faculties of fortune, fate, astrology, religion, magic, luck and more. Healing could therefore constitute anything from curing a specific disease, to averting a malevolent force, or fostering good fortune. This functional variation is valuable, as it can tell us a great deal about the practices and cultures in which objects are situated, as well as the objects themselves. For instance, around 250 years after Pepys cured his colic with our first amulet, the hare’s foot, an amusement park opened in Paris. As part of their brand <em>Luna Park</em> adopted a mascot known as a ‘Billiken’, a creature devised by an American artist who reportedly saw the mysterious figure in a dream and patented it in 1908. The Billiken, known as ‘God of Things as They Ought To Be’ was said to bring the customer luck, indicated by the inscription upon our second object, the park’s token: <em>Si tu me gardes je te porterai bonheur</em> (‘If you keep me I will bring you good luck/happiness’) / ‘I smile at you bad luck can’t harm you’.<a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a> This amulet offered protection and generated auspicious effects to the person who possessed it. Evidently, it had been considered important enough to be kept. Thus whilst culturally, temporally and materially distinct, the hare’s foot and the Luna Park Billiken are nevertheless united by their curative and protective potency, and demonstrate the wide spectrum of healing.</p></div>

</section>
<div><p>Yet where once healing and amulets went hand in hand, modern discussions tend to treat them as distinct. Labelling certain objects as ‘amulets’ questions their power to work, and when these items and their potency are challenged, they are ‘othered’, relegated and disassociated from the realms of healing. The hare’s foot provides an example of this. Whether situated in museum collections or referred to in common parlance, this amulet is not commonly recognised today as a curative object, nor regarded as an effective remedy for the colic. Instead, the feet of rabbits and hares are now bought, used and regarded often merely as ‘lucky’ items. This hare’s foot from the Science Museum’s collections is recorded as an amulet employed ‘for protection against cramp’.<a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a> To label something as prophylactic, an item ‘against’ a particular affliction exemplifies …</p></div></div></section></article></div>

<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

<p><strong>^^^ PLEASE USE POST USING ABOVE LINK FOR MY “ONE-LINE IT JUST WORKS” ^^^</strong><br>
(IGNORE EVERYTHING BELLOW THIS AS IT’S THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT WORK)<br>
===================================================================</p>
<p><strong>Everything from this point down is out of date as of: 3-30-2020</strong></p>
<p>This was my initial “netflix on the raspberry pi 4 development” blog post. Leaving it on here due to the comments, initial work, info for those interested, but I highly recommend using the easy method above (linked).</p>
<p>Last libwidevine extract: 3-29-2020 – v.4.10.1610.6 of libwidevine – EVERYTHING CONFIRMED WORKING</p>
<p><em><br>
Chromium has made substantial changes the way libwidevine (and a few major things around DRM) are loaded/used/etc. They have also made changes to the setting and reading of the user-agent propagation. For some time (~2 months or so) — the combination of this badly broke Netflix. It seems they have undone the lib loading in the last couple of versions, and user @Spartacuss discovered the user-agent fix.</em></p><p><em>The instructions here (as of 3-29-2020) work for: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and many others.</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 model with 4GB of RAM is the first cheap hardware that can provide a real “desktop-like” experience when browsing the web/watching Netflix/etc. However, if you have tried to run Netflix on the Pi, you have quickly entered the disgusting mess that exists around DRM, WideVine (Netflix being one example of something that needs it), and Chromium.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of effort, I finally discovered a quick and elegant solution that lets you use the <strong>latest default provided Chromium browser</strong>, without having to recompile anything in order to watch any WideVine/DRM (Netflix, Spotify, etc) content.</p>
<h2>Background and the DRM Problem</h2>
<p>If you are not familiar with this, the short version is that Netflix (and many others, ex: Spotify) use the WideVine “Content Protection System” – aka DRM, and if you want to watch Netflix or something else that uses it, you need to have a WideVine plugin+browse supported integration. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari make it available for x86/amd64 systems, but not for ARM since technically they don’t have ARM builds.</p>
<p>Chromium, the project Chrome is based on, does have an ARM build, but it does not include any DRM support, and technically it does not include widevine support by default (*caveat here, which helps us later)<br>
So long story short, the question becomes “how do you enable DRM/WideVine support in Chromium?”.</p>
<p>It seems there are two main solutions out there: use an old (v51, 55, 56, 60) version of Chromium which has been “patched” with widevine support (kusti8’s version seems to be the most popular one – except since the new Netflix changes, that also does not work), which requires uninstalling the latest Chromium available, installing the old/patched one, and dropping in older widevine plugins; the second option is to use Vivaldi – a proprietary fork of Opera which also has been “sort of patched”, but it still needs a valid libwidevinecdm plugin (see bellow) and it has it’s own issues (and also…it’s Opera…in 2019…who uses Opera?)</p>
<p>After a lot of research and trial and error, I discovered a much more elegant solution – use the extracted ChromeOS (armv7l – yay) binaries and insert them into Chromium + make everything think it’s ChromeOS (user agent)</p>
<h2>Netflix/Hulu/Spotify with the Default Raspberry Pi Chromium Browser</h2>

<p><strong>Enough theory – let’s do this in 2 quick steps!</strong><br>
0.) If you have tried Netflix/etc already, open Chromium and clear your browser history + cookies. Otherwise it will cache the “failed” DRM components.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Download the latest extracted ChromeOS <a href="http://blog.vpetkov.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libwidevinecdm.so_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libwidevine</a> binary and extract it:</strong></p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p><strong>2.) Completely QUIT all Chromium windows.</strong><br>
Start Chromium with the new Application Menu under “Internet”: <strong>Chromium (Media Edition)</strong><br>
<del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">Open a new tab, and go to: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm You should be able to see the movie on the left. </del>(While this still works, it will show “No DRM” unless you set the Chromium user-agent from within the app – which breaks Netflix. BitMoving unfortunately looks for that first. Just go to Netflix/Your media source directly.)<br>
You can now play Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify, Pandora, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and many others!</p>
<p>Please note that If you can see the video on the left, this means the DRM plugin has worked! From this point on, anything that does not work (ex: Netflix sometimes breaks after a browser update) is due to the site specifically filtering User Agents/doing other “tricks”. So for example, if Netflix does not work, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc will still work. <del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">The BitMovin website is the “real” test on wether the DRM plugin has worked.</del>(While still technically true, if your Chromium user-agent is not set from within the app itself, which breaks Netflix, BitMovin will show “No DRM” even though the DRM decryption works)</p>

<p>It seems the Pi’s raw CPU frequency is still not powerful enough for decoding 100% of the time. While 97-98% of the time is good enough, you will get the occasional “screen tearing” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing), especially in scenes with fast motion.</p>
<p><del datetime="2020-04-07T04:18:34+00:00">Users Otaku, DM (and thanks to Luca for testing/extra info!) have found a solution which was mentioned on https://lb.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=246179 by user Greysvandir.<br>
I had to add a few more things and I created a compressed and slightly automated 😉 version:<br>
# sudo apt install -f compton<br>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi<br>
$ cd ~/.config &amp;&amp; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastorm/Compton-xfce-config/master/compton.conf<br>
$ cp -f /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “@usr/bin/compton –backend glx” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “xrandr –output HDMI-1 –mode 1280×720” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
The result is no tearing with 1080p@60fps video.<br>
</del></p>
<p><strong>(OPTIONAL) Get libwidevinecdm version</strong><br>
If you want to check your *actual* libwidevinecdm version, the easiest and quickest way is using user VMX’s elegant python solution:</p>

<h3>Release Date:</h3><p>
January 26, 2021
</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>
A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
<em>Baron Samedit</em> by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.
</p><h3>Sudo versions affected:</h3><p>
Sudo versions 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are
affected.
</p><h3>CVE ID:</h3><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156');">CVE-2021-3156</a>
in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/');">Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a> database.
</p><h3>Details:</h3><p>
When sudo runs a command in <em>shell</em> mode, either via the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> command line option, it
escapes special characters in the command's arguments with a backslash.
The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from
the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn't
expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell
mode.
</p><p>
A bug in the code that removes the escape characters will read
beyond the last character of a string if it ends with an unescaped
backslash character. Under normal circumstances, this bug would
be harmless since sudo has escaped all the backslashes in the
command's arguments. However, due to a different bug, this time
in the command line parsing code, it is possible to run <tt>sudoedit</tt>
with either the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> options,
setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a
command is not actually being run, sudo does <strong>not</strong>
escape special characters. Finally, the code that decides whether
to remove the escape characters did not check whether a command is
actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency
is what makes the bug exploitable.
</p><p>
To test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable, the following
command can be used:
</p><pre>sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
</pre><p>
If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable.
If the result is a <strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, sudo is
vulnerable.

</p><h3>Impact:</h3><p>
A local user may be able to exploit sudo to elevate privileges to
root as long as the sudoers file (usually /etc/sudoers) is present.
</p><h3>Workaround:</h3><p>
None. Sudo version 1.9.5p2 or a patched vendor-supported version
must be installed.
</p><h3>Fix:</h3><p>
The bug is fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2.

report and explanation of its implications.

		<p>It should come as no surprise that we here at Plex are media lovers. Consummate curators of all that streamy goodness. Voracious imbibers at the fount of all content. Okay, gross, but you get the point. Anyway, every so often an armchair Reddit philosopher comes forth to question some basic truths: “What exactly is the nature of ‘Media’?” they ask. And “How can Plex help us media lovers more fully consummate our curationship?” Okay, sorry, gross again. But it’s a fair question, and one that deserves a little more attention.</p>
<p>Not to date ourselves, but quite a few of us are products of the ‘80s and ‘90s. And when we think about the media that shaped our childhoods and young adult lives, there was one thing that defined us and made it clear that even though we were weird, at the very least we weren’t weird alone. That’s right: <em>stamp collections!</em></p>
<p>Oh wait. We meant VIDEO GAMES.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYepu_5oSOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>In the beginning…</h3>
<p>The genesis of Plex saw us casting a disdainful eye over shelves of CDs, DVDs, and random files strewn over hard drives; we knew there had to be a better way to centrally organize and curate our media collections. A safe haven free from scratches and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bewaring-of-the-green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green markers</a>. A place where we could Marie Kondo until every last poster and background was perfect, and then explore and play from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But there was one category left on that media shelf, gathering dust. It was the old plastic cartridges for our beloved gaming consoles of yore. After all, in the years since our youth, fellow curators have managed to amass rich archives of gorgeous metadata for games, and the retro gaming community truly does run deep. It’s a fantastic movement, and after some soul searching and spiritual walkabouts, the answer arrived: this media belongs inside Plex!</p>
<p>We’ve actually kicked the idea around for years, and given that over the last year we’ve been looking for new ways to entertain and distract ourselves, we decided to finally make it happen. And we gotta say, the results are super cool! It’s so fun to see a collection of ROMs rendered as a Plex library with all the power of filtering, searching, and beautiful details pages, but of course that’s only half the picture…</p>

<h3>Let there be light!</h3>
<p>Video and audio streaming have always been our specialty. We’re blessed with some amazing engineers (among the best in the world!) working on this, and in general we’ve been laser focused on making that experience better.</p>
<p>However, over time we’ve seen some truly impressive developments in interactive game streaming tech. Please allow us to introduce our new partner <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsec</a>: With their underlying low-latency streaming technology, it was suddenly possible to offer <em>fully playable</em> game libraries within Plex.</p>
<h3>Let the library teem with games</h3>




<p>We’ve also partnered with the most hallowed name in retro games: Atari. With them on board as a partner we’re able to fully license a catalog of classic titles right out of the box. We’re talking Centipede. We’re talking Lunar Lander. We’re talking Motor Psycho!</p>

<p>On account of these partnerships and the licensing involved, Plex Arcade will be a separate subscription for <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you have a Plex Pass (and <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you haven’t made the leap to Plex Pass yet). Don’t know if you’ll like it? <a href="https://www.plex.tv/arcade/checkout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Try it free for 7 days</strong></a> (that’s a whole week among friends), no strings attached, and let us know what you think.</p>
<h3>Be fruitful</h3>
<p>Look. This effort is real, but if we’re honest it was conceived by a few passionate Plex Labs rats over scorpion bowls at <a href="https://www.mamasfishhouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama’s</a>. For now, we’ve convinced the powers-that-be to let us run with it, but we know it’s far from done and we see it as a kind of internal Kickstarter-type project. If there’s interest and we see some subs, it’ll grow into the glorious pheasant we know it can be. But if you guys drop the ball, it’ll die on the vine like a stomped ass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goomba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goomba</a>.</p>

<p>There are a few limitations you should be aware of: For now, the server only works on Windows and macOS (sorry, Parsec doesn’t offer their libraries on Linux or other platforms currently, meaning it is not available for servers running on Linux, NAS devices, or NVIDIA SHIELD); and gameplay is restricted to Android (mobile and TV), iOS, tvOS, and the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>To get started, grab the latest Plex Media Server, and create a new Games library, just like you would for any of your existing media types. We’re working on relaxing these limitations, but for now they’re real.</p>

The aim is to have a distributed architecture and to avoid having all users connecting to a single server and choke it up. Therefore we distribute the incoming traffic by making use of a load balancer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png" alt="load balancing" width="762" height="433" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-300x170.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-768x436.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-696x395.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px"></figure><p>The load balancer thus becomes a key component in our architecture, diverting traffic based on different techniques that we will discuss later in this post. Its main responsibility is to avoid convergence of traffic and thus avoiding choking of the system.</p><p>Load balancers thus become the first point of contact for the client requests.</p><p>There can be multiple load balancers in a system as well. One each for various tiers of the application. This would help handle the separate application tiers more effectively and also scale them independently if needed.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png" alt="load balancing multiple tiers" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-300x138.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-768x354.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-696x321.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>It is also important to mention that when a load balancer redirects to a particular location, it might not hit an application server. It might hit another load balancer that is implemented at a location-based cluster in a data center if we were scaling globally.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If a server goes down, the load balancer also ensures that no traffic is directed to that server until it is back up and running. This is done by performing health checks that ensure the load balancer is only sending traffic to servers that are online.</p><p>But how do we decide which machine the user will land upon?</p><h2>Types of load balancing</h2><p>There are three types of load balancing:</p><ol><li>DNS load balancing</li><li>Hardware-based load balancing</li><li>Software-based load balancing</li></ol><p>As with everything, there are pros and cons to either of the approaches. Let us discuss them in detail.</p><h2>DNS load balancing</h2><p>DNS load balancing is the most commonly used technique for load balancing. Instead of having dedicated hardware for resolving which server to redirect to, a nameserver is responsible for managing traffic.</p><p>The nameserver has a list of IP addresses that correspond to the various servers that can be routed to. Every time someone queries for a particular domain, the nameserver returns this list of IP addresses and changes the order of the addresses. The reordering is done in a round-robin fashion. Thus, every new request is routed to a different machine in a round-robin order And the load gets distributed among different servers.</p><p>The reason a list of IP addresses is returned and not a single IP address is to have a failover strategy. If the first IP address does not respond in a stipulated amount of time, the client can call the next IP address in the list.</p><p>Though this is a popular strategy, it has its limitations too. What the strategy does not factor in is the existing load on the server, the processing time of the server, their online status, etc.</p><p>Another limitation of this technique is that IP addresses are cached on the client machine’s DNS resolver. This can be mitigated by setting a low TTL (time to live, or how long to store the mapping for). But it is a tradeoff since longer TTL means clients do not know about changes and shorter TTL may improve accuracy but increases DNS processing and DNS caching was implemented to mitigate that in the first place. Also, the client might choose to disregard your TTL value altogether. So it is not guaranteed.</p><p>Another limitation is of possibly routing to a machine that is not functional will exist. Though most cloud services these days do provide health checks along with DNS balancing these days, but it might not be true for all services.</p><p>The most common use case for this type of load balancing is for distributing traffic across multiple data centers, possibly in different regions. It is also preferred by companies because it is a cost-effective solution and easy to deploy.</p><h2>Hardware-based load balancing</h2><p>As the name suggests, we use physical appliances as a load balancer. They sit in front of the application servers and handle the distribution of traffic.</p><p>These are highly performant pieces of hardware that factor in the number of open connections, how much compute is being utilized and several other parameters to decide where to route the traffic to.</p><p>Having dedicated hardware to take care of load balancing is highly performant. It also is efficient since a dedicated machine is responsible for evaluating load distribution. The throughput is fast because of the specialized processors. It also provides the benefit of increased security since physical access to the hardware can be limited by the organization.</p><p>But hardware is expensive to purchase, to set up and it requires maintenance and regular updates. It can also require network specialists since it can be a lot of work to do for a developer.</p><p>Another disadvantage is that we have to factor in the scenarios where there is extreme peak traffic and plan for purchasing hardware accordingly. This is not the case for software-based load balancers.</p><h2>Software-based load balancing</h2><p>Software-based load balancing is the process of installing load balancing software on cost-effective hardware and VMs. They are cheaper and provide more flexibility than the hardware ones. They can also be provisioned and upgraded easily.</p><p>The major benefit of software-based load balancers over DNS load balancers is the flexibility and the advanced configuration options. We can configure load balancing on the basis of multiple parameters like cookies, HTTP headers, CPU utilization, memory consumption, network load, etc. We will discuss the different algorithms that can be implemented in detail later.</p><p>A benefit of the software-based approach over the hardware one is that we can scale beyond the initial capacity by just adding more VM based instances. No need to buy additional specialized hardware. We also would have to plan ahead of time for peak traffic if we were buying specialized hardware to manage it. In the cloud, there are no hardware balancers, and you purchase more virtual machines to fulfill your needs. This ends up being cheaper.</p><p>There are many “software-balancers as a service” services out there that allow us to use them without any configuration of our own. Or we can install the software from one of the open-sourced versions ourselves. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HAProxy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nginx</a> are fairly common ones that many enterprises use as well.</p><p>Since there are a lot of ways in which the software-based load balancers can be configured, we will discuss the major algorithms to do so next.</p><h3>Traffic routing algorithms used by software balancers</h3><p><strong>Round Robin: </strong>Similar to DNS based routing, a software uses a list of IP addresses and rotates through this list on every request. Nothing else is taken as a parameter.</p><p><strong>Weighted round-robin</strong>: A modified variation of the round-robin in which the traffic is routed in a weighted manner. The weights are determined by the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities. Thus, machines that can handle more traffic get more of it relative to those that can handle less.</p><p><strong>Least connections:</strong> Traffic is redirected to the machine that has the least amount of current network connections. Similar to the previous one, there are two approaches. One assumes that all requests to a server take equal server resources. The other takes into account the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities while making the decision of least open connections.<br>This approach is a good candidate for scenarios where the connections are long-term ones and stay open for larger durations, such as live streams or gaming applications.</p><p><strong>Random:</strong> The load balancer picks two servers randomly and then using the least connections mechanism, sends the request to the one that gets selected.</p><p><strong>Hash-based: </strong>A key is defined on the basis of which distribution takes place. The key could be the client IP address, or the request URL, or both. Hashing the IP ensures that the requests from an IP are always redirected to the same server. This is useful in cases where the server has some in-memory data/cache about the user’s information.</p><p><strong>Least time:</strong> This builds up on the least connections method. The traffic is redirected to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p><p>And that is all there is to know about the basics of load balancing. Load balancing plays a prominent role in distributed architectures and helps in scaling our applications. It also helps improve responsiveness and achieve high availability.</p><p>If you have any queries, feel free to drop a comment below.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>1M </b> pages visited
            </p>
            <p><b>65</b> metrics per page

        <p>Can you do better than our analysis? We <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/indexhtml/web-performance-metrics">published the dataset to Kaggle</a>, so you can crunch the numbers yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>

            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for linked resources</b></li>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-correlation.png" alt="Correlations with dominteractive">
            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for metrics, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>main_doc_is_http2_or_greater (-477.53)</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png" alt="Texas Hold ‘Em startup poker" width="484" height="817" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png 1184w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-186x314.png 186w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-372x628.png 372w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-768x1297.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-910x1536.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png" alt="Market vs business model" width="599" height="472" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-399x314.png 399w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-797x628.png 797w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-768x605.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-1536x1210.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8.png" alt="The latecomers get into the game" width="699" height="411" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8-535x314.png 535w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8-1069x628.png 1069w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8-768x451.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8-1536x902.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

A CrashLoopBackOff is possible for several  types of k8s misconfigurations (not able to connect to persistent volumes, init-container misconfiguration, etc). We aren’t going to cover how to configure k8s properly in this article, but instead will focus on the harder problem of debugging your code or, even worse, someone else’s code 😱</p><p>Here is the output from kubectl describe pod for a CrashLoopBackOff:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Name:           frontend-5c49b595fc-sjzkg</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>Namespace:      tedbf02-ac-david-nginx-golang-tmcclung-nginx-golang</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>Priority:       0</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>Start Time:     Wed, 23 Dec 2020 14:55:49 -0500</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>Labels:         app=frontend</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>                pod-template-hash=5c49b595fc</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>                tier=frontend</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>Status:         Running</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>IP:             10.1.31.0</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>IPs:            &lt;none&gt;</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>Controlled By:  ReplicaSet/frontend-5c49b595fc</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>Containers:</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  frontend:</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    Container ID:   docker://a4ed7efcaaa87fe36342cf7532ff1de5cd51b62d3d681dfb9857999300f6c587</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    Image:          .amazonaws.com/tommyrelease/awesome-compose/frontend@sha256:dfd762c</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>    Image ID:       docker-pullable://.amazonaws.com/tommyrelease/awesome-compose/frontend@sha256:dfd762c</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    Port:           80/TCP</span></p><p><span>18</span><span>    Host Port:      0/TCP</span></p><p><span>19</span><span>    State:          Waiting</span></p><p><span>20</span><span>      Reason:       CrashLoopBackOff</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>    Last State:     Terminated</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>      Reason:       Error</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>      Exit Code:    1</span></p><p><span>24</span><span>      Started:      Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:25:26 -0500</span></p><p><span>25</span><span>      Finished:     Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:25:26 -0500</span></p><p><span>26</span><span>    Ready:          False</span></p><p><span>27</span><span>    Restart Count:  9043</span></p></pre></div><p>Two common problems when starting a container are OCI runtime create failed (which means you are referencing a binary or script that doesn’t exist on the container) and container “Completed” or “Error” which both mean that the code executing on the container failed to run a service and stay running.</p><p>Here’s an example of an OCI runtime error, trying to execute: “hello crashloop”:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Port:          80/TCP</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    Host Port:     0/TCP</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    Command:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      hello</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      crashloop</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    State:          Waiting</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      Reason:       CrashLoopBackOff</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    Last State:     Terminated</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>      Reason:       ContainerCannotRun</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>      Message:      OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:370: starting container process caused: exec: "hello": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>      Exit Code:    127</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>      Started:      Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:20:04 -0500</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>      Finished:     Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:20:04 -0500</span></p></pre></div><p>K8s gives you the exit status of the process in the container when you look at a pod using kubectl or <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s" title="k9s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">k9s</a>.

In order to get the startup command when you’re dealing with someone else’s container, we need to know the intended Docker <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> of the Docker image.

Using the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> you discovered earlier, you can execute the intended startup command and see how the application is failing.</p><p>Depending on the container you’re running, it may be missing many of the tools necessary to debug your problem like: curl, lsof, vim; and if it’s someone else’s code, you probably don’t know which version of linux was used to create the image. We typically try all of the common package managers until we find the right one. Most containers these days use Alpine Linux (apk package manager) or a Debian, Ubuntu (apt-get package manager) based image. In some cases we’ve seen Centos and Fedora, which both use the yum package manager.</p><p>One of the following commands should work depending on the operating system:</p><ul><li><code>apk</code></li><li><code>apt-get</code></li><li><code>yum</code></li></ul><p>Dockerfile maintainers often remove the cache from the package manager to shrink the size of the image, so you may also need to run one of the following:</p><ul><li><code>apk update</code></li><li><code>apt-get update</code></li><li><code>yum makecache</code> </li></ul><p>Now you need to add the necessary tools to help with debugging. Depending on the package manager you found, use one of the following commands to add useful debugging tools:</p><ul><li><code>apt-get install -y curl vim procps inetutils-tools net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>apk add curl vim procps net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>yum install curl vim procps lsof</code></li></ul><p>At this point, it’s up to you to figure out the problem. You can edit files using vim to tweak the container until you understand what’s going on. If you forget all of the files you’ve touched on the container, you can alway kill the pod and the container will restart without your changes. Always remember to write down the steps taken to get the container working. You’ll want to use your notes to alter the Dockerfile or add commands to the container startup scripts. </p><h2 id="debugging-your-containers">Debugging Your Containers</h2><p>We have created a simple script to get all of the debuging tools, as long as you are working with a container that has curl pre-installed:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>/bin/sh -c </span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>curl</span><span> -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/releaseapp-io/container-debug/main/install.sh</span><span>)</span><span>"</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve learnt how to spot and investigate the CrashLoopBackOff errors in containers.

<h4>The GPD P2 Max is a hyper-powered cross between a palm pilot and an ultrabook - it's a cyberdeck by any other name...</h4>

<p>The early 1990s were a great time to be a kid. There was the ever present threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls">nuclear annihilation</a>, we were constantly being reminded that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/">Greed was Good</a>, and it marked the advent of truly portable computing.</p>

<p>Sure, laptops had been <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/08/the-1978-xerox-notetaker-the-first-computer-to-be-used-on-a-commercial-flight-xerox-vintagecomputing-history/">available for a while by that point</a> - albeit at a price which would financial cripple small countries - but the first part of the final decade of the 20th century saw the arrival of computing devices which would actually fit in your pocket.</p>

<p>There was a kid in every school whose Dad had been given one by his work, decided it was too complex, and who <em>palm</em>ed it off to their offspring in the misguided belief it would help them organise their busy juvenile lives.</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3">Psion 3</a> had a keyboard and a screen. It had an address book, database software, contact managers, calculators, agendas, and world clocks - everything the high-powered 80's corporate executive could ever need to organise his high-powered 80s executive life.</p>

<p>To adolescents in the schoolyard, it had limited practical utility beyond being cool as hell - it could be flipped shut, and it could fit in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
Granted, owning one of these bad boys would not grant an amazing degree of popularity to the possessor, and the technological gap between the home and office computers of the day and the popular palmtops, meant that it would only ever be of limited utility.
</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Regardless, the palmtop computers were so cool as to be ice cold, and I have long wanted one which could be genuinely useful, fill the gaps left wide open by even the best mobile phones, and perform as well as a desktop PC. I wanted a   <a href="https://cyberdeck.cafe/">cyberdeck.</a></p>

<p>This led to a spree of purchases of Linux-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook">netbooks</a> and EeePCs in the early to mid 2000s - all of which were abandoned as underpowered, locked-down limited-use-case wastes of money not long after.</p>

<p>The dream of a cyberdeck died - or at least fell into a coma - until the Raspberry Pi came on the scene.</p>

<p>It was ultra-low power, tolerable performance, and cheap as chips. Pi-based Cyberdecks began appearing on reddit in the (incredibly long) run-up to the release of CDPR's <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>I even made my <a href="https://www.cyberpunks.com/super-simple-dirt-cheap-diy-portable-raspberry-pi-laptop/">own, super cheap, super low-tech version</a> which was published on another site.</p>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Pi</a>, excellent though it is, is a little <em>too</em> low powered to be used as a daily driver. Yes, you can use it as your main machine, but you’ll soon feel that it’s lacking… something.</p>

<p>And so, up until yesterday, I was using a 14” Dell E7470 for my everyday work and play, and carrying a Linux powered Oneplus 3 as my phone and for my mobile computing needs. The Oneplus, running <a href="https://www.ubports.com/">Ubuntu Touch</a> is great if privacy is your main concern, but as pocket sized computing platform, it’s just not there.</p>

<p>And then yesterday morning I smashed the screen of my Dell. Disaster! I write for a living, I work from home and I have deadlines. The repair is going to cost around 80 quid if I do it myself, and I would be offline for over a week. If a similar disaster occurred under normal circumstances, I’d work from the local library, but due to the current pandemic, that isn’t really an option.</p>

<p>Chinese hardware company GPD advertises the <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQEoH">P2 Max</a> as “The world’s smallest Ultrabook,” and it is. There was also one for sale less than a mile away from me.</p>

<p>Money changed hands (at a suitable social distance), and I took my new purchase home with me.</p>

<h4> What's in the box?</h4>

<p>It’s a hella small box, and in it is a hella small, gunmetal grey laptop. It’s of comparable size to one of the palmtops of old, and I can pretty much cover the whole thing with one of my hands.</p>

<p>Open the lid, and there is a keyboard will full-sized keys. Just not very many of them.</p>

<p>There’s the usual QWERTY layout, cursors, CAPS, and numericals - but there a few noticeable absences. Only one shift, Alt and Ctrl, for instance. This isn’t a big deal as one hand can easily span the entire keyboard. There are no function keys either. The mousepad is about as small as it can be while still being usable. Again that’s OK as this tiny GPD ‘ultrabook’ comes with a 10 point touchscreen, and most of the time I use a USB optical mouse anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/gpd_P2_max_is_tiny.png" alt="Honestly, it's really small!"></p>

<p>The device is powered by a standard Type C USB of the same type I use to charge my mobile, and in return, offers two Type A USB ports (one on each side), a micro HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s not the most expansive array of ports, but it keeps the size and weight down.</p>

<p>The screen itself is a work of wonder. At 8.9 inches, it can support resolutions of up to 2560 x 1600 px. That’s insane. No-one on Earth has eyesight good enough to comfortably read text that small for an extended period. Yes, it’s just about do-able, and the text itself is perfectly formed, but eyestrain will quickly become an issue. After spending an evening at 1920 x 180, I eventually set it to an easy 1440 x 900 px.</p>

<p>So, it’s a teeny tiny laptop with a great screen and a good keyboard, but is it an ultrabook?</p>

<p>GPD certainly thinks so - it’s the machine’s headline selling point. Personally, I’m not even sure what an Ultrabook even <em>is</em>, apart from being a somewhat flexible marketing term.</p>

<h4>Specs matter</h4>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned the netbooks i previously owned. They failed as proto-cyberdecks because they were just not up to the task of everyday computing. They weren’t even really up to the task of basic web browsing.</p>

<p>The GPD P2 Max is different. The model I now own came with a 512GB SSD, and a solid 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s pretty solid. The processor is an eighth gen Intel. On paper at least, it’s similar to my currently unwell Dell.</p>

<p>Windows 10 Home edition booted to desktop in a few seconds -long enough for me to verify the specs before installing my OS of choice.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu Linux install took around 10 minutes, and i3 wnt quickly on top of that. I was able to retrieve the conf files from my old machine over SSH, and just like that, I was home.</p>

<p>Yes, it took a few minutes to get used to the keyboard, and I kept banging my fingers into the touchscreen and acidentally stealing focus, but meh. A person gets used to these things.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>The best way of judging the performance is to tell you exactly how I’m using the machine at the moment, and how I’ve used it in the single day since it’s been in my house.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m writing this article in Atom on Workspace 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On workspace 1, I have three XFCE terminals open - running Bashtop, TaskWarrior, and an SSH to my Pi which is tailing my access logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace two has a Firefox window with 27 open tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace three has another Firefox window with a dozen or so tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Workspaces one, two and three open automatically with their contents intact on boot.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace four has an incognito Firefox window, in which I’m doing research I probably won’t want to reference again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace six is running a <a href="https://thecrow.uk/why-does-this-site-look-like-crap-getting-used-to-life-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a> local server in a terminal, automatically updating the preview of this article on workspace four.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace seven is running a script which periodically checks for comments on this blog and brings them to my attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Workspace eight, I have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/freelancing-in-a-time-of-quarantine-and-why-rss-is-the-greatest/">QuiteRSS</a>, checking for writing jobs on my behalf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In workspace nine, I’m conducting a war of attrition against Matthias Corvinus of the Hungarian Empire in <em>Civilization VI</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is the GPD P2 Max capable? Hell yes. I’m using it exactly how I used my old laptop. I’ve been playing games through Steam. I’ve been  Windows games using WINE. I’ve been productive and I’ve been having fun.</p>

<p>And when I’ve finished, I can pick it up and put it in my pocket. Even better, the screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so the accident which happened to my Dell can never happen again.</p>

<p>It’s a cyberdeck.</p>

    <p>2021-01-26 08:59:23+00:00</p>
    <p><a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a> is the “new” (13 years old already) display server technology on Linux, which is supposed to replace
the antiquated X11. It promises better security, performance, portability, everything, compared to X11, and
it sure does deliver, provided that you’re not using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/">unsupported graphics cards</a>.
You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIctzAQOe44">this talk / rant about X11</a> to get an idea about how bad it is.</p>

<p>Some power users also haven’t switched to Wayland because their window manager doesn’t have a
Wayland equivalent (XMonad, Awesome, Bspwm and the others, all having their unique feature-set). Some may wonder “hmm maybe I can port it myself”. I wrote this post to make you (re)consider that.</p>

<p>One of the main ideas of Wayland is that it’s merely a specialised IPC protocol, and the communication is
strictly between the clients (applications on your screen mainly) and the server.</p>

<p>The server is what we are interested in now. Unlike X11, where the server is X.Org and the window manager
is just an X11 client with special privileges, on Wayland the window manager is also a server and a compositor. In fact, the correct terminology is “Wayland compositor”. This piece of software has the
task of doing everything it wants with the clients, which is usually among the lines of showing them
on the screen and giving them inputs events from your keyboards, mice, touchscreens etc. In fact, <a href="https://mir-server.io/">no one
stops you from leaving window management as an API</a>.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I prefer using GNOME under Wayland, because it has the most stable, fully-featured and “just works”
experience there is. However, I wanted a better way of organising windows on my screen than leaving them
shuffled around. Tiling was also not good, because every time you launch a new window, the others get
shrunk to fit, which is not good on a small laptop display.</p>

<p>Luckily I discovered <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a>. It’s perfect for laptops, instead of
shrinking your windows, it just renders them off-screen. To switch between one or the other you can just
flick three fingers on the touchpad. It’s great. It’s also “glossy” and polished and has great UI and animations.</p>

<p>It has some disadvantages though, mainly concerning its speed. I find it sluggish, and it’s no surprise that
like all other GNOME Shell extensions, it’s a JavaScript behemoth. PaperWM still uses the GNOME Tweener
framework for its animations, which is entirely written in JS. Because of that, it needs to communicate with the main
GNOME compositor process on each operation. And because we’re talking animations, said operations happen
for <em>every frame</em>. That means there is JS executed for every frame, 60 times a second. It’s horrible!</p>

<p>BTW nowadays GNOME uses animations implemented in C (since GNOME 3.34), the “GNOME runs JS on every frame” statement is for the most part false today.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficiency of PaperWM, it also means that it drains my battery quickly, which is bad for a laptop!</p>

<p>So, because I am a student with a lot of free time, together with <a href="https://alexge50.com/">Alex</a> we figured we shall develop a scrollable tiling (PaperWM-like) Wayland compositor. It’s called <a href="https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard">Cardboard</a> (get it??). It also has the nicety of
being controlled and configured by a remote control program, like bspwm.
Neither Alex nor I had experience with any kind of Wayland development. However, I wrote <a href="https://tudorr.ro/software/windowchef/">an X11 window manager</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tudurom/disputils/">some XRandR querying utilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tudurom/ruler">a window rule daemon</a>. Alex has experience
with <a href="https://git.alexge50.com/a/gie">graphics programming</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alexge50/libwatchpoint">C++ devilry</a>.</p>

<p>Our “tech stack” was <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>, which is an exceptional Wayland compositor library (apart from its lack of documentation). The description from the README is spot on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About 50,000 lines of code you were going to write anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I (because I wrote most of the Wayland-interfacing code) realised soon that there is still a lot of boilerplate involved in writing a compositor, much more than for an X11 window manager,
namely setting up your own rendering code, registering and storing input devices and screens in your own data structures, passing input events to windows, calculating bounds for bars
and other overlays (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml"><code>layer-shell</code></a>) and others. X11 handles all of this for you,
the window manager just reacts to events regarding window inputs to establish its behaviour. With Wayland, you handle everything, even with wlroots. The upside is that if you don’t like the way X11 does something
(which is a given), not only that you can do it in your own way on Wayland, you are required to do so.</p>

<p>Because we weren’t really prepared for what writing a compositor involved, we thought that it must be approached like a “normal” program: split code into modules, each with their own responsibilities, call wlroots to do its thing, the usual stuff.
We are writing a program in our way and wlroots lets us “interface with Wayland”. Or so we thought.</p>

<p>We were as careful as possible to separate responsibilities into different structures / classes, yet we ended up with most functions taking a pointer to <code>Server</code> as their first parameter.
<code>Server</code> is a singleton holding all the other “sub-modules” in it. It represents the compositor itself. The reason most functions need <code>Server</code> is that everything is related to everything,
not because of a mistake in structuring the code, but by design. This is what a compositor requires, the problem of writing a compositor is somewhat complex because it has a great deal variables ranging
from input events, drawing on the screen, creating behaviours that the user leverages, reacting to application events. All of them can affect the other, you can not separate the thing into modules.
The best you can do is separate the code in different files and folders based on some criteria, like grouping data structures with related routines.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take damage tracking. For starters, because the compositor is also tasked with rendering the content and displaying it on the screen, we have some rendering code that runs on every frame.
Damage tracking is tracking which areas of the screen have changed in an amount of time. An example would
be typing a letter in the terminal. The place where the cursor is changes to the letter you typed, and the cursor advances.
If there is no change, the frame is not rendered, as it would look
exactly the same as the previous one, which would be a waste of processor time.
This way, instead of re-rendering everything 60 times a second (I assume that you use a common display), we can render and paint as little as possible to account for the changed region.
You can read <a href="https://emersion.fr/blog/2019/intro-to-damage-tracking/">an introduction to damage tracking</a> written by one of the main developers of wlroots.</p>

<p>I have just implemented the most basic form of damage tracking: do not render the frame if nothing on the screen changes.
It doesn’t track the damage itself, just that it exists.
To do this, I first added a <code>wlr_output_damage</code> object to my <code>Output</code> structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct Output {
</span>    struct wlr_output* wlr_output;
    struct wlr_output_damage* wlr_output_damage;
<span>+   struct wlr_box usable_area;
</span>    ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This structure tracks the damage accumulated per-output, as rendering is also per-output (this means that you can use screens of different refresh rates, yay!). However, to make this initial attempt at
damage tracking easier, I decided to trigger rendering for all attached outputs. I added a <code>set_dirty()</code> function to the <code>OutputManager</code> class that does just that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>OutputManager</span><span>::</span><span>set_dirty</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>output</span> <span>:</span> <span>outputs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>wlr_output_damage_add_whole</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>wlr_output_damage</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This marks every output as entirely damaged, and as such triggers a render.</p>

<p>With this function set into place, I had to identify when does the “screen” change, namely when a window “commits” (changes its contents) and when a window is moved. The window move is one example
of the way everything is related to everything in the …</p></article></div>

    <p>You may have heard that TypeScript has been taking the web development space by storm in the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">last</a> <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">few</a> <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/">years</a>, bringing to it static types. I believe the same thing is starting to happen in the world of Python, where type checkers like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>,  <a href="https://pyre-check.org/">Pyre</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a> are increasingly used, at least where Python is used by companies to write large systems.</p>

<p>For the last several releases of Python, there have been an increasing number of type checking features added to each release by various PEPs:</p>




<p>The traffic on <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/">typing-sig</a>, the mailing list where most major new typing features are proposed and designed, has also been seeing increasing traffic year over year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I personally have found type checking to be very useful when working on large Python applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It helps me find numerous small errors that are introduced during regular development<!-- such as import errors-->. Sure, most of these errors would be caught by the automated tests that I write for each new feature anyway<!-- TODO: footnote+link to TDD or similar practice? -->, but the type checker can find a whole bunch of errors all at once without even running the program, which decreases cycle times when adding new features:</p>

<p>Without type checking I tend to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat 4-6 times, in rapid succession:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Run program to manually test.</li>
<li>Find basic error (like a missing import).</li>
<li>Fix basic error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>But <em>with</em> type checking I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Run the type checker. Get a report of 4-6 basic errors. Fix basic errors immediately.</strong></li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>I appreciate this increased productivity that type checking gives me when working on large programs. And I hope that more Python users try type checking for themselves, especially as Python gains an increasing number of related features in recent releases. It’s an exciting time to be a Python developer!</p>

      <p>We’ve joined <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html?utm_campaign=The%20week%20in%20newsletters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This is big news for people who use Revue, people who will start using Revue and the whole team who built it. So in this email I wanted to go a little deeper than just this news. And that’s what email does better than any other platform. It lets you go deeper with a wide audience, both in your relationship and in your thinking. Add nuance, context, speak personally.</p><p>That experience inspired us to build the first version of Revue. We wanted to make sending an email newsletter as simple and enjoyable as Tweeting. That core goal has never changed, but the world around us sure has.</p><p>Email has become a much more important publishing platform. The publishing world is working even harder at its re-invention. And we’re proud to be part of that. Today, Revue makes it easy for a wide variety of creators and publishers to send a newsletter — and make money from it.</p><p>We help them find an audience, create a deep connection and grow without limits.</p><p>Today, we serve a spectrum of customers, from ambitious media upstarts like The Markup to independent creators like Scott Melker and even large legacy publishers like Germany’s Madsack. And while different, all of them come to Revue for one purpose: to transform how we share and absorb content.&nbsp;</p><p>They want to change the way publishing works. Who gets heard and who gets paid. And that’s what connects their goals to us, the people who build Revue.</p><p>The folks over at Twitter are amazing partners who believe in and add to our mission. Thanks to them we can invest more, build faster, and get better for you.</p><p>Thanks to our joining Twitter, we can make publishing on email even more accessible. As a first step, we’re excited to share some updates that will improve the way you can build and get paid for your content:</p><p>🤝 Starting a newsletter on Revue is now free</p><p>🤝 On paid newsletters, we only charge 5%</p><p>We’ve made these changes so that everyone can be a creator on Revue, with the opportunity to scale their newsletters and a paying audience without the added fees or obstacles that can limit growth.</p><p>One important element to our customers success is giving you full control. You own your audience, your content, your brand. You can send from your own domain. You can connect Revue to hundreds of other tools without coding. And of course we have an API for you to build on.</p><p>We are also building a version of Revue for larger creators and publications. They have even more control, This version offers features like fully custom designs and tools to help them manage their audience, cross-promote newsletters and include subscription offers.</p><p>For now, we’ll continue to operate as a standalone business. But expect to hear more about how we’re working with Twitter soon as we look at more ways to help you grow faster, be discovered more easily and build even deeper connections.</p><p>Our goal is to create the single best place in the world for media businesses of the future to start, to grow big and to innovate. There is a lot to do, so we’ll keep working on it — along with all the people who use Revue.</p><p>🧡</p><p>Martijn, Founder</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611636833572/KkMic2coN.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>  is an open-source low code platform for developers to build internal apps and workflows.</p>
<p>In Appsmith, our developer users define business logic by writing any JS code in between <code>{{ }}</code> dynamic bindings almost anywhere in the app. They can use this while creating SQL queries, APIs, or triggering actions.
This functionality lets you control how your app behaves with the least amount of configuration. Underneath the hood, the platform will evaluate all this code in an optimized manner to make sure the app remains performant yet responsive.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of binding a query response to a table widget.</p>
<p>It all starts with the binding brackets <code>{{ }}</code> . When the platform sees these brackets and some code in it, in a widget or action configuration, it will flag the field as a dynamic field so that our evaluator can pick it up later. In our example let us bind usersQuery to usersTable</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182443695/gunous9nM.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.08_PM.png"></p>
<p>Since we have added this binding in our tableData field, we will flag this field and store it in our widget config</p>
<pre><code>
{
  <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        ...
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [
            {<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}
            ...
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the background, our evaluation listener, always keeps a lookout for such events that would need an evaluation. For our example, this is a scenario that definitely needs an evaluation, so it kicks off our evaluator.</p>
<p>We pass on our current list of app data constructed in what we call as <code>DataTree</code> to the evaluator thread and patiently wait to hear back from it ⏱</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"config"</span>: {...},
        <span>"data"</span>: [...]
    },
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [{<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For performance reasons, we run our evaluation process in a separate background thread with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>. This ensures that evaluation cycles running longer than 16ms do not hang up the main thread giving the app bandwidth to always respond to user events.</p>
<p>Inside the thread, the event listener gets a wake-up call and gets to work. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get differences</strong>: First it will calculate differences in the <code>DataTree</code> from the last time. This will ensure we only process changes and not the whole tree.</p>
<p>  In our example, we would see the <code>usersTable.tableData</code> has changed and <code>usersTable.dynamicBindingPathList</code> has a new entry.</p>
<p>  It takes each difference, filters any un-important changes, and processes the rest.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get evaluation order with dependency map</strong>: It also maintains a <code>DependencyMap</code> between various entity properties. The evaluator will notice if any bindings have changed and recreate the sort order accordingly.</p>
<p>  For our example, we will infer that <code>usersTable.tableData</code> now depends on <code>usersQuery.data</code>. This means that the query response should always be evaluated before we can evaluate the table data and that whenever we see a change in the query response, we need to re-evaluate the table data as well</p>
<pre><code>  
  {
      ...
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>: [<span>"usersQuery.data"</span>]
  }

  
  [
      <span>"usersQuery.data"</span>,
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>
  ]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate:</strong> After creating an optimized evaluation order, we will evaluate the update the tree, in that said order. Evaluation happens via a closed <code>eval</code> function with the whole <code>DataTree</code> acting as its global scope. This is why we can directly reference any object in our <code>DataTree</code> in our code.</p>
<pre><code>  

  <span>const</span> code = <span>`
    usersQuery.data.map(row =&gt; ({
      name: row.name,
      email: row.email
    }))
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> scriptToEvaluate = <span>`
    function closedFunction () {
      const result = <span>${code}</span>;
      return result
    }
    closedFunction()
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> result = <span>eval</span>(scriptToEvaluate);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and parse:</strong> We always want to make sure the values returned after evaluation to be in the right data type that the widget expects. The ensures the widget always gets predictable data even if your code has returned some errors. This is also needed for any function down the line in the evaluation order, if it refers to this field, will always get a reasonable data type to work with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that completes it. At the end of this, we will have a fully evaluated <code>DataTree</code> that we can then send back to the main thread and start listening for any new event to do this whole process again.</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"data"</span>: [...] 
    }
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: [...]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our main thread gets an event saying the evaluation is complete, with the new evaluated <code>DataTree</code> which it stores in the app redux state. From here, the widgets pick up their data and render it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182466454/vym6oXaQG.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.22_PM.png"></p>
<h3 id="summarizing-our-philosophy">Summarizing our philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pull vs Push:</strong> While building a low code app builder for varied developers, we thought hard about how the written code works with the rest of the platform. We wanted configuration to be easy to start yet powerful when it needed to be. For this reason, we went with a Pull based architecture rather than Push.</p>
<p>  What this means is that in most places, you won't have to think about how the data will get to a field. You write code that pulls everything from the global <code>DataTree</code> and sets it to the field where you write it. This way the moment the underlying data changes, it get propagated to all the fields dependant on it and you as a developer do not have to orchestrate ui changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> One-way data flow:</strong> Since we are built on top React.js and Redux, we strongly embrace the one-way data flow model.</p>
<p>  What this means is that you cannot set a table's data directly to that field from some other part of the app. If you do need to update the table, you will have to trigger the query to run, which will then cause the table to re-render with the new data. This helps the code you write easy to reason about and bugs easy to find. It also encapsulates each widget's and action's logic in itself for good separation of concern.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On 8 January 2021 at 14:05 CET the synchronous area of Continental Europe was separated into two parts due to outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time. ENTSO-E has published the first information on the event already on 8 January 2021, followed by an update with geographical view and time sequence on 15 January 2021. Since then, ENTSO-E has analysed a large portion of relevant data aiming to reconstruct the event in detail.</p><p>This second update presents the key findings of detailed analyses, which have a preliminary character subject to new facts, which will emerge in the still ongoing investigation.</p><p>The analysed sequence of events concludes that the initial event was the tripping of a 400 kV busbar coupler in the substation Ernestinovo (Croatia) by overcurrent protection at 14:04:25.9. This resulted in a decoupling of the two busbars in the Ernestinovo substation, which in turn separated North-West and south-east electric power flows in this substation. As shown in Figure 1 below, North-West bound lines which remained connected to one busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Zerjavinec (Croatia) and Pecs (Hungary), while South-East bound lines which remained connected to another busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Ugljevik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Sremska Mitrovica (Serbia).</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ca35232da145a366158c9b4df33d787e40d621c9/129ad/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-2.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The separation of flows in the Ernestinovo substation, lead to the shifting of electric power flows to neighbouring lines which were subsequently overloaded. At 14:04:48.9, the line Subotica – Novi Sad (Serbia) tripped due to overcurrent protection. This was followed by the further tripping of lines due to distance protection, as shown in Figure 2, below, leading eventually to the system separation into two parts at 14:05:08.6.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f409f977d1a2b6c2df1e49861416d463445808b0/06d80/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-3.png" alt="" title="Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The route where the two parts of the Continental Europe Synchronous Area were separated is shown in Figure 3 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/de60ebc1aaeb673286f78d35b23db319639b40f6/35e86/assets/graphics/uploads/thrid.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>The system separation resulted in a deficit of power (approx. -6.3 GW) in the North-West Area and a surplus of power (approx. +6.3 GW) in the South-East Area, resulting in turn in a frequency decrease in the North-West Area and a frequency increase in the South-East Area.</p><p>At approximately 14:05 CET, the frequency in the North-West Area initially decreased to a value of 49.74 Hz within a period of around 15 seconds before quickly reaching a steady state value of approximately 49.84 Hz. At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz as illustrated in Figure 4 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/670b8/assets/graphics/uploads/forth.png" alt="" title="Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation"></p><p><em>Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation</em></p><p>Due to the low frequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy (in total around 1.7 GW) were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are provided by large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to be disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation from the nominal value of 50 Hz was reduced to around 0.1 Hz in the North-West area (Figure 4).</p><p>In order to reduce the high frequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated, including the reduction of generation output (Eg. automatic disconnection of a 975 MW generator in Turkey at 14:04:57). As a consequence, the frequency in the South-East Area returned to 50.2 Hz at 14:29 CET and remained within control limits (49.8 and 50.2 Hz) until the resynchronisation of the two separated areas took place at 15:07:31.6 CET.</p><p>Between 14:30 CET and 15:06 CET the frequency in the South-East area was fluctuating between 49.9 Hz and 50.2 Hz due to the rather small size of the South-East Area where also several production units were disconnected (Figure 5). During this period, the frequency in the North-West Area fluctuated far less and remained close to the nominal value, due to the rather large size of the North-West Area. This frequency behaviour is a subject of further detailed investigation.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83de537eb517d8e18789e4116bb3561294bf39c8/a45a4/assets/graphics/uploads/graph_nw_se_03_1400h-1515h.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration "></p><p><em>Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration</em></p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored close to normal operation. The contracted interruptible services in Italy and in France were reconnected at 14:47 CET and 14:48 CET respectively prior to the resynchronisation of the North-West and South-East areas at 15:08 CET.</p><p>ENTSO-E continues to keep the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group, composed of representatives of Member States, informed and updated with detailed results of the preliminary technical analyses.</p><p>Based on the preliminary technical analyses presented above, a formal investigation following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) will be established, whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join with TSOs in an Expert Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017, ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish a report once the analysis is completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Note:</strong> All figures and details about the sequence of the events are still subject to final investigation and possible changes.</p><p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p><p>What is a system separation?</p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East Area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered further. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce the electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p>What is an electrical busbar?</p><p>A busbar is an electrical junction in a substation, which connects overhead lines, cables and transformers through electrical switches. Usually, there are several busbars in a substation, which can be connected by a busbar coupler. Are there special devices protecting the equipment in a substation? Various devices protect the equipment in a substation. One of them is an overcurrent protection relay, disconnecting automatically the equipment (Eg. overhead line or cable) if the electrical …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

The officers returned to the airport and located the couple as they were getting ready to leave the territory, Streicker said.</p>    <p>The tickets list the Bakers as sharing an address in downtown Vancouver, although social media posts appear to indicate that they split their time between B.C. and Toronto.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Meanwhile, White River First Nation, whose government office is located in Beaver Creek, issued a statement over the weekend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/white-river-first-nation-harsher-penalty-covid-rule-breakers-1.5885828">condemning the couple's actions </a>and calling for harsher penalties.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Couple jumped COVID-19 vaccine queue:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Outrage over B.C. couple jumping COVID-19 vaccine queue" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1848396867671-metadata-" title="Outrage over B.C. couple jumping COVID-19 vaccine queue"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/465/635/FLETCHER-VACCINE-COUPLE.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>There is growing outrage over a B.C. couple's elaborate scheme to jump the queue for a COVID-19 vaccine.

Those wouldn't have necessarily prevented them from getting a vaccine as there are many out-of-territory workers in the North.</p>  <p>But he said the territory has obtained sample copies of all other provincial and territorial health care cards to be kept with the mobile vaccine units so the units can determine&nbsp;if a health card is valid,&nbsp;"in case someone's trying to fake that."</p>  <p>The Yukon government is also working on ways to find supporting evidence that someone is actually employed in the territory.</p>  <p>"All that is being sorted out by the team right now to try and figure out how to keep everybody safe," Streicker said.</p>    <p>He said the incident was shocking, but said officials&nbsp;don't think it will happen again.</p>  <p>"We just didn't anticipate that anyone would go to this length to effectively deceive the team to get vaccinated, and I think we all felt pretty offended at the whole thing," Streicker said.</p>  <p>"But we will put in place additional procedures …&nbsp;I don't imagine that this is going to repeat itself."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Diem</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/michael_burry.jpg" alt="Michael Burry"></p>
<p>Christian Bale playing Michael Burry</p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/short_squeeze.jpg" alt="Billions Short Squeeze"></p>
<p>Billions, IRL (image via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/02/09/billions-for-the-99-episode-4-what-it-means-to-face-a-short-squeeze/?sh=5d3100f36d69">Forbes</a>)</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f7b3cf53449abc80ad4f"><div><p>Happy new year from Toronto!</p><p>I’ve compiled my favorite ways to convey your product’s value prop. These apply to products and brands, but feel free to apply this to people too. These work for job interviews, selling yourself as a consultant, etc.</p><p><strong>Use before-and-after</strong>: <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/comparisons-heighten-drama" target="_blank">Everyone loves a good before-and-after contrast</a>. Before-and-afters are a powerful application of the idea of “show not tell.” That’s why you see so many before-and-afters when scrolling through your feed: weight loss (not-your-best self vs toned/healthy), home renovation (dingy bathroom vs shiny new renovation), messaging copy (bad writing vs strong writing), etc. A before-and-after is like a jump cut that skips all the boring parts--it emphasizes contrast, which heightens drama and interest. When talking about yourself, show what a project was like before you arrived and what it looked like after your contributions.</p><p><strong>Show, not tell</strong>: I recently came across AI-driven software that reduces background noise on calls. The thing that caught my eye on their homepage is the toggle “on” and “off” button where you can hear a sound sample without their tool versus how much sharper the sound is with their tool. It was pretty incredible and instantly sold me. As a marketer, I’m always on the lookout for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/case-study-dissecting-an-everyday-story" target="_blank">when I change my mind</a>. It’s hard to change people’s minds, so when it happens successfully, try to learn what worked. Think of how you can demonstrate the value of your product like this.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610079443099_26862"><div><p><strong>Experiential, temporal, sensory</strong>: It’s hard for most brands to describe your product’s value quickly. It’s especially hard if your product has an experiential, temporal, or sensory component.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Experiential</em>: How do you convey a sense of community and belonging? The altMBA had this challenge. In-person courses had websites that showed photos of participants drawing on post-its and pointing at white boards. But our course was entirely online. Photos of people sitting at a computer would hardly do justice. We ended up using screenshots of Zoom gallery view among other things. Not perfect, but we chose to rely less on photography and more on other design elements given this constraint.</p></li><li><p><em>Temporal</em>: How do you convey the value of your product if it lasts 10x longer than competitors who are selling for cheaper? How do you convey the value or benefit of your product if there’s no immediate benefit in a world that loves instant gratification? Think of examples of products you’ve purchased where there’s less immediate value but more long-term value, and how the value prop was positioned.</p></li><li><p><em>Sensory</em>: How do you convey smell through a computer screen? How do you convey how good your weighted blanket feels? To solve this, consumer products will focus more on the emotion, less on the product features. For body wash, the brand doesn’t talk about how the sulfates will get you clean, how it smells, and the ounces of product you get. They talk about taking a moment for yourself.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t worry about correct grammar</strong>. Go ahead and break grammar rules. The only thing that matters is that your customer takes action and you build trust in the process. I add that last part about building trust because you want to aim for conversion, but not destroy your brand equity in the process. It’s a delicate balance per the <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-performance-marketing" target="_blank">Brand vs Performance Marketing Spectrum</a>.</p><p><strong>Increase desire, don’t just decrease friction</strong>: People jump through hoops for things they want. Did you pick your spouse because they were the most convenient option? No, you picked them despite needing to overcome obstacles. We tend to focus on removing friction because it feels comfortable and there’s a checklist of ways to do it. There’s less of a formula for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/increasing-desire-vs-decreasing-friction" target="_blank">increasing desire</a>--which makes it all the more worthwhile because there’s upside potential that fewer people attempt to tap into.</p><p><strong>Be/Have/Do</strong>: This is one of my favorite frameworks for showing transformation. You want to show how your product helps a brand transform. What does your product let your customer be that they weren’t before? What do customers have that they didn’t have before? What can they do now that they couldn’t do before? This is a good exercise to focus your value proposition and generate talking points for business development, sales, and marketing copy.</p><p><strong>Aim for “No brainer status”</strong>: You need to aim for an instant yes. Not a yes after a hundred hours of nurturing. Think about what features, benefits, and value would make this an instant yes for your prospective customers. By the way, even if you think it’s an instant yes, you’ll still need to work at getting the yes. <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/everything-takes-longer-than-you-think-so-plan-accordingly" target="_blank">Everything takes longer than you think</a>. The reason to aim for a no brainer status is because this is like a rubber band. We’re stretching it, but it will snap back a bit.</p><p><strong>Do what makes their eyes light up (ELU)</strong>: You should have your pitch ready, but <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/eyes-light-up-elu" target="_blank">watch out for what makes people’s eyes light up</a>. What makes them lean in? You can tell when someone doesn’t really care about what you’re saying. Then there are moments when suddenly a spark of aliveness flashes in their eyes because you just said something they care about. Watch for ELU.</p><p><strong>Avoid backstory scope creep</strong>: This applies to showing your value via email, pitches, or conversations. Remove the 90% of stuff that’s only moderately relevant, and be ruthlessly focused on the 10% that’s most relevant to your audience. Talking about your camping trip? <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/start-right-before-you-get-eaten-by-the-bear" target="_blank">Start right before you almost get eaten by a bear</a>. Not a detailed agenda of the days leading up to arriving at camp.</p><p><strong>Consider overhauling and starting from scratch</strong>: If you’re struggling to describe your value, figure out <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-fix-limbo-copywriting" target="_blank">if the problem is the marketing or the underlying idea</a>.</p><p><strong>Focus on what your customer wants to hear about, not what you want to talk about</strong>: This is an easy way to figure out what to trim from your talking points. You think, “I have so much to talk about. Where do I start??” Start by asking yourself what would change your audience’s behavior for the better. I call this principle <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/strategy-not-self-expression" target="_blank">Strategy, Not Self-Expression</a>.</p><p><strong>Choose the right heuristics and design to appeal to people like us</strong>: Upon landing on a site, most customers are judging you within a few seconds. “People like us” refers to whatever group you might identify with. For example, people like us could be thoughtful, design-conscious knowledge workers at tech startups.</p><p>What’s a product that instantly sold you?

                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/FictionalFlag.jpg">Did you ever want to live in your own country, to make your own rules? Tired of adjusting yourself to other people?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>One solution is to buy a decommissioned cargo ship, and then strand it on a very shallow part of the sea, on international waters. You need really deep pockets and an adventurous spirit to succeed with this, but what an exciting adventure it would be!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding a ship</h2>
                    <p>The ship has to be large enough to become a small island where you can live permanently, and sustain yourself through growing of food. It also has to be large enough to not get turned over in a storm. This leaves us with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker" target="_blank">oil tankers</a>. They are flat bottomed, and have several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_oil_tanker" target="_blank">compartments</a> for the cargo which will make them more stable in rough seas.</p>
                    <p>To know the price of decommissioned ships we can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking" target="_blank">ship breaking yards</a>. In <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4365831,91.7317171,15z" target="_blank">Chittagong, Bangladesh</a>, there is one of the biggest ship grave yards in the world, where they run the ships full speed onto the shore, and the locals are busy cutting them up into pieces and selling it as scrap metal.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: The coastline of Chittagong is lined with ships.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard.jpg"></p>
                    <p><i>Below: Zooming in you can see how the ships are being cut to pieces.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The scrap metal companies buy a medium size ship for around <a href="http://www.jimbojack.com/Countries/Bangladesh/Bangladesh_Chittagong_Ship-breaking_Yards.htm" target="_blank">$10 million</a>. Add to that the cost of sailing the ship to its final destination.</p>
                    <p>What remains is to contact shipping companies, and add yourself to the wait list of one of their vessels.</p>
                    <h2>Destination</h2>
                    <p>The challenge is to find a part of the ocean that is very shallow, but on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">international waters</a>, which is 22 km (12 nautical miles) from the shoreline. To be safe, it should also be out of each country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone" target="_blank">exclusive economic zone</a>, which is 370 km from the shoreline.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: Waters (light blue) outside of any country's exclusive economic zone (dark blue).</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.jpg"></p>
                    <p>If possible it should be in a climate that makes farming easy, in a part of the world not afflicted by piracy, and in relatively calm waters.</p>
                    <p>How shallow does the ocean have to be? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)" target="_blank">draft</a> of a reasonably large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax" target="_blank">Panamax</a> class tanker is 10 to 15 m.</p>
                    <p>To find the shallow parts of the oceans, we can use <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>&nbsp;to visualize data about seamounts (mountains in the oceans) from <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/" target="_blank">SeaAroundUs.org</a>, and then match this with the EEZ areas, as a user has done at the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/forum-list/topic/natural-breakwaters-avoiding-waves-geography/" target="_blank">Seasteading.org</a> web site.</p>
                    <p>I have saved the data files here for future reference: <a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz">ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/SeamountsUnder100m.kmz">SeamountsUnder100m.kmz</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Vitoria-Trinidade site looks like the easiest and safest option, and also the least afflicted by storms.</p>
                    <p>The ship could possibly be sailed slowly into position, and then sunken to rest on the ocean floor, by initially filling the tanks with water, and then replacing it with rocks sourced from the bottom.</p>
                    <p>But this requires the ocean floor to be reasonably flat, which might prove difficult, so a more realistic approach would be to anchor the ship using several huge anchors and long chains, and then filling up the bottom of the ship with ballast to make the ship behave well in storms.</p>
                    <p>On top of the deck you fill up with soil and plant trees and have various types food production. A Panamax ship has a deck of around 280 x 30 m, which is 8,400 m2, or the size of a soccer field.</p>
                    <p>Fresh water is made by desalination of sea water. Solar panels provide electricity. For housing the existing bunks of the ship is used.</p>
                    <p>Some obvious considerations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protection from intruders.</li>
                        <li>Having sustainable food production.</li>
                        <li>Protection from storms and high waves.</li>
                        <li>Hull maintenance, to save it from deteriorating in the saline water.</li>
                        <li>Carefully examining the site to look for geological problems (under water volcanoes, active fractures, etc).</li>
                    </ul>
