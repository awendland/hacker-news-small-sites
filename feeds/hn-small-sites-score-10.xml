<p>In the early summer of 2018, Norway received an unusual request from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's government.</p><p>Saudi Arabia wanted to send ten men on an official assignment to Norway, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms to Dagbladet. The ten men were all security guards, who were deployed to work at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Norway, according to Dagbladet’s sources. But Saudi Arabia wanted the security guards to be registered as diplomats in Norway. This would give them extended room for manoeuvring in Norway.</p><p><strong>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intervened, and the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) has informed Iyad el-Baghdadi (43) - a Norway-based journalist, activist, and critic of the Saudi regime - about the incident. </strong></p><p>Dagbladet has asked the Saudi embassy several questions regarding this article. The embassy has responded with a press release they originally sent out last year, criticising "fabricated and false" accusations, "with the intent to insult Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p>Dagbladet has received confirmation from several sources that there were several issues regarding the ten-man security team that made the Norwegian authorities react.</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<h2>The crucial points</h2><p>• <strong>The number:</strong> The number of security guards was unusually high. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly publishes a list of all foreign diplomats accredited to Norway. According to the diplomat list from the summer of 2018, the total number of Saudi diplomats in Norway at the time was 18. Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that the Saudis were about to almost double the number - with only security people.</p>
<p>• <strong>The status:</strong> Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that Saudi Arabia requested that the security guards be granted diplomatic status - and registered in the official <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/ud/dep/forbindelser/id447053/">Diplomat List</a>. It is unusual for security people at embassies to be registered as diplomats. Both diplomats and other embassy personell - arriving on a so-called «D-visa» to Norway - is given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>. Which, as one of several benefits, means that the host country cannot arrest you if you commit a crime. But being registered formally as a diplomat gives you a wider range of benefits.</p><p>• <strong>The increase:</strong> Norwegian authorities reacted to the fact that the major increase in security staff did not reflect what they knew regarding the activity level at the embassy.</p><p>• <strong>The key role:</strong> Officials at PST have later noted that security personnel, from the consulate in Istanbul, played key roles in the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Dagbladet has learned.</p>
<p><strong>The PST declined to comment on this article, however, it has been presented with all the information herein – without finding any errors.</strong></p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>Guri Solberg, spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirms in an e-mail to Dagbladet:</p><p>“In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs registered ten persons as new envoys at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Oslo. The status of other countries' envoys to embassies is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and the role of the envoy at the embassy. As these were mainly persons who were to have internal tasks at the embassy, nine of the ten persons were registered as administrative / technical personnel in accordance with normal practice. One of the ten people was registered as a diplomat based on their role and responsibilities. In practice, there is little difference in the degree of immunity and privileges granted to diplomatic, administrative, and technical personnel. The rules on immunity and privileges are dictated by international law by which Norway is bound, in particular the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations, that includes immunity from criminal prosecution in the host state.”</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>The men arrived in Norway at the end of July 2018. The one security guard who received the diplomatic status Saudi Arabia requested, now works as Head of Security at the Saudi Arabian embassy, according to Dagbladet's sources. He is formally listed in the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic list as an "attaché".</p><div>

<p>“It was a discussion. There are regulations for the type of status that the embassies' security people can hold whilst staying in Norway. They are not diplomats”, a source familiar with the case tells Dagbladet.</p><div id="factbox-73180109" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="1">
    <h2>Facts: Diplomatic immunity in Norway</h2>
        
    
        <p>According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, all envoys from other countries have diplomatic immunity when they are working for their country’s embassy. This applies to both diplomats and administrative personnel, such as security staff. <br></p><p>However, different degrees of immunity are granted, according to the rank of the individual within the system. Only diplomats have full immunity. <br></p><p>Neither diplomats nor security staff at embassies can be prosecuted or subjected to taxation in Norway. Security staff (administrative personnel) do not, however, have immunity from civil proceedings arising from their conduct in private. Whilst diplomats can import as much as they desire tax-free for private use, administrative personnel are only exempt from customs duties on entry to a country. <br></p><p>Norway can sanction an envoy with diplomatic immunity by declaring them persona non grata in Norway.</p><p><em>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs</em></p>

<p>If you travel by sea to the Frognerstranda harbour, at times you can spot the Kingdom's characteristic green flag - with a white sabre, and the inscription "There is no god without Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet" - waving over the hedge. From a magnificent villa, designed in 1899 by the famed Norwegian architect Ingvar Hjorth, Saudi Arabia manages its activities in Norway.</p>
<p>Dagbladet has asked the Embassy in Oslo why they requested the security guards be granted diplomatic immunity, about the points Norway reacted to, about the Embassy’s relationship with the activist Iyad el-Baghdadi, and about why the Embassy wanted to increase the number of security guards by so many.</p><p><strong>The Embassy has declined to meet with Dagbladet, preferring to respond by email, with a press release originally sent out in 2019:</strong></p><p>"The Embassy is informed about what has been circulated in some media in regard to Mr. Iyad el-Baghdadi and the allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Embassy would like to clarify that this person is not a Saudi citizen and is unknown to the Kingdom. What he said is fabricated and false and aims to offend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We have been in contact with the Norwegian Government to provide the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with further information in this regard. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reserves the right to take the necessary legal measures against the mentioned-above in order to safeguard its rights."</p>

<h2>The meeting in Oslo</h2><p>At the same time that Saudi Arabia requested that the security team were registeret as diplomats - in the spring / early summer of 2018 - el-Baghdadi and Khashoggi met in Oslo.

However, Dagbladet knows that PST informed him about the Saudi security team in a meeting.</p><p>- I had a meeting with my contact in PST in January this year. They said Saudi Arabia had applied for an unusually high number of diplomatic visas - which were denied.

<p>Here is my personal list of legally free Python books. <strong>Warning: Packt free books are highly unreliable, what can be free today can no longer be free tomorrow They were included as they are free at the time of writing this post. Similarly is Oreilly’s case. The two publishing houses have been annotated as necessary.</strong> In case of no longer free or broken links please mail me at `arj.python at gmail dot com` to update article. I have to thank the internet who took the pain to point these resources to me. I have skimmed through the contents to producs a list of legally free Python books of value. Here’s how i evaluated books (you might not agree, but that’s my personal take on it):</p>




<p>Some popular listed books like Python Module of the Week  is not a book and Tango with Django 1.7 is outdated.  Materials which provide only some free chapters are not free books. Docs manuals are docs manuals, you’d have to include a quarter of pypi’s packages manuals then. github projects are gihub projects unless it’s a book. Mark pilgrim ran away so should we from his book. We don’t want some illegal 100+ free list (Mark Lutz books are not free mind you), you could include all Python books hosted on drive then. Python2 is past, we passed over. Fullstackpython’s list is a collection of various sites’ articles, not a book. Really short books more qualified as leaflets did not make it. Such materials have been deliberately left out. What remains are books that you’ll enjoy!</p><p>

<p>Dr. Kristian Rother</p>



<p>The perfect introduction for completely new people </p>



<h3><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Non-Programmer’s Tutorial for Python 3</a></h3>

<h3> <a href="http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/pythonbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Coder’s Apprentice </a></h3>



<p> Pieter Spronck </p>



<p> “The Coder’s Apprentice” aims at teaching Python 3 to students and teenagers who are completely new to programming. Contrary to many of the other books that teach Python programming, this book assumes no previous knowledge of programming on the part of the students, and contains numerous exercises that allow students to train their programming skills. </p>



<h3> <a href="https://www.brianheinold.net/python/python_book.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Practical Introduction to Python Programming </a></h3>



<p> Brian Heinold </p>



<p> The book aims at striking the balance between a tutorial and reference book. Includes some fun exercises at the end! </p>



<h3> <a href="https://python.swaroopch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Byte of Python </a></h3>



<p>Swaroop C H</p>



<p>“A Byte of Python” is a free book on programming using the Python language. It serves as a tutorial or guide to the Python language for a beginner audience. If all you know about computers is how to save text files, then this is the book for you. </p>



<h3><a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/intermediatepythongithubio/latest/intermediatepythongithubio.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intermediate Python</a></h3>



<p> Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid </p>



<p> Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, there is a lack of documentation on what to learn after getting the basics of Python down your throat. Through this book I aim to solve this problem. I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore. The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like this when I was beginning to learn Python. If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book. Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given.  A true example of legally free Python books. </p>



<h3><a href="http://ralsina.gitlab.io/boxes-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boxes: Your Second Python Book</a></h3>



<p>Roberto Alcina</p>



<p>This book tries to achieve only one thing: Show you a project go from&nbsp;<strong>nothing</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. By nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No goals, no commitments. Just a vague interest. And by OK I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to use, it will be&nbsp;<strong>useful</strong>&nbsp;and be a real thing. Think of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only instead of rockers there is a single overweight Argentinian dev, and instead of a band there is a piece of software. So, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.</p>



<h3><a href="https://learnpythonbreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Python, Break Python</a></h3>



<p>Scott Grant</p>



<p>Learn Python, Break Python is a hands-on introduction to the Python programming language, written for people who have no experience with programming whatsoever. Hey, we all have to start somewhere. As such, the examples and teaching style used in this text make absolutely no expectations about your prior programming experience. Anyone can pick up the art of programming with a little time and a bit of patience. However, when learning something new, I try to break things. In fact, in many cases, I go out of my way to break stuff. When picking up a new concept like computer programming, you can actually increase your comfort level by figuring out the type of cases that are likely to break. You’ll see what data can be used and where, and when you inevitably run into errors later (like everyone does), you won’t be surprised.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/PyBook/swan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorithmic Problem Solving with Python</a> </h3>



<p> John B. Schneider, Shira Lynn Broschat, Jess Dahmen </p>



<p>(Not an algo book) Python’s syntax and idioms are much easier to learn than those of most other full-featured languages. This book uses programming language Python to introduce folks to programming and algorithmic thinking. </p>



<h3> <a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/python-guide/latest/python-guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.</a></h3>



<p>Kenneth Reitz</p>



<p> This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.slitherintopython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slither Into Python</a></h3>



<p> Slither into Python is an introduction to Python for complete beginners. No prior programming experience or computer science background is necessary. Unlike any other Python resources I have found (not that they’re not out there), they don’t explain important computer science concepts such as memory or “how computers work”. In this book I will cover the fundamentals of the Python language and also introduce these important concepts. Put simply,&nbsp;<em>coding</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>computer programming</em>&nbsp;is about making computers do what you want, Computer Science is about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;computers do it. Each go hand-in-hand, help you learn faster and improve your overall understanding of a language! This book aims to do exactly that through Python. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a></h3>



<p>Jake VanderPlas – Oreilly</p>



<p>The book provides a whirlwind tour of some of Python’s essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language. My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack just outlined. </p>



<h3><a href="https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python For You and Me</a></h3>



<p>Kushal Das (Core Dev)</p>



<p> A book for the total new comers into Python world. Was started as book for students before they read Python tutorial. Given it’s from a core dev, even up to chapter choice order is insightful.</p>



<h3> <a href="https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python for Astronomers </a></h3>



<p> Imad Pasha, Christopher Agostino </p>



<p> This text is designed to be an introduction to the Python programming language — which is now used nearly ubiquitously in astronomy — with applications to the types of tasks an undergraduate (or beginning graduate student) might have to tackle. It is not, in any way, meant to be comprehensive; my focus is on bringing you up to speed as efficiently and quickly as possible. This text might have useful information for those with a working knowledge of Python outside of a research setting, but is primarily designed for those with no prior programming experience. By the end of this text, I hope to have shared enough to make you feel comfortable taking the first steps into research-type problems (of which this book will contain several examples), whether in an astronomy course, a research internship, or on-campus research. </p>



<h3><a href="https://leanpub.com/intermediatepython" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBI Intermediate Python</a></h3>



<p> Obi Ike-Nwosu </p>



<p>The python ecosystem is awash with books for beginners but few books target readers that are past the beginning stages but are not yet advanced users. The book aims to bridge that gap. The content of this book looks primarily at the various means for code organization in Python and provides user with a rigorous grounding in these. it dives into topics such as python object system, functions, decorators, metaprogramming and generators providing the reader with an in-depth knowledge of these topics that is essential for writing idiomatic and robust python code. It aims to&nbsp; provide a reader with not only a …</p></div></div>

<p>Few events are as compelling as an epidemic. When sufficiently severe, an epidemic evokes responses from every sector of society, laying bare&nbsp;social and economic fault lines and presenting politicians with fraught medical and moral choices. In the most extreme cases, an epidemic can foment a full-blown political crisis. Thus,&nbsp;Thucydides describes how the repeated visitations of plague to Athens in 430-426 BC&nbsp;provoked widespread social disorder and the breakdown of civic norms.</p>



<p>‘Men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred or profane,’ writes Thucydides. ‘All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset and… many had recourse to the most shameless sepulchres.’</p>



<p>As the plague progresses, Thucydides describes how Athenians were swept up in a wave of hedonism and lawlessness, threatening the foundations of Athenian democracy: ‘Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner… fear of gods or law of man there was none to restrain them.’</p>



<p>The resulting crisis, Thucydides claimed, undermined Athenians’ faith in the rule of law and the democratic principles that underpinned the Greek city state, paving the way for the installation of a Spartan oligarchy known as the Thirty Tyrants. Even though the Spartans were later ejected, Athens never regained its confidence.</p>



<p>Covid-19 appears to have engendered a similar crisis in our world, the main difference being in scale. Whereas the crisis Thucydides describes was confined to Athens, the coronavirus pandemic has destabilized governments from Brazil to Belarus,&nbsp;not just that of a 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century city-state. The political reckoning has been particularly rapid in the United States, where Donald Trump’s inability or unwillingness to check the spread of the coronavirus was a key factor in his recent election defeat. Now, the lockdowns and social distancing measures look set&nbsp;to&nbsp;plunge the world into the worst economic depression since the 1930s, raising the spectre of further political instability.</p>



<p>Given the wide-ranging&nbsp;social, economic and political impacts of Covid-19, it is natural to assume that the same must have been true of past epidemics and pandemics. But is this the case? Do pandemics really have the historical impacts that are often claimed for them or are these claims simply the product of particular narratives and readings of history? &nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in&nbsp;numerical terms, the most devastating pandemic of all time was the 1918-19 ‘Spanish influenza’. Coinciding with the end of the First World War, the Spanish flu is estimated to have killed between fifty to one hundred million people worldwide. However, while 1919 was the first year since records began that the death rate exceeded the birth rate, those that survived generally enjoyed longer and healthier lifespans and, in many instances, benefited from higher wages too. Moreover, while the global death toll was immense, in developed industrial countries the mortality rate averaged two percent, meaning the Spanish flu left most of society unaffected. Indeed, the Spanish flu appears to have made little impression on public memory and social institutions, hence its historiographical characterisation as the&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/why-historians-ignored-the-spanish-flu-101950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘forgotten pandemic’.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-narrating-epidemic-crises">Narrating Epidemic Crises</h2>



<p>A crisis is normally conceived of as an isolated moment in time in which our lives are shattered and plunged into disorder – what the cultural anthropologist Hendrik Vigh has called&nbsp;‘a momentary malformation in the flow of things’.&nbsp;Vigh <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141840801927509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observes that</a> for many people crises are ‘endemic rather than episodic’ and cannot be delineated as an aberrant moment of chaos or a period of decisive change.&nbsp;This is particularly the case for those living at the margins of society for whom crises are ever present. Indeed, social critics such as Naomi Klein argue that instability is baked into the capitalist system, hence the way that&nbsp;in the last few decades<strong>&nbsp;</strong>neoliberal societies have lurched from one financial crisis to another.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, crises have long been regarded as a way of accessing deeper historical truths. As Janet Roitman <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/330/Anti-Crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has argued</a> in&nbsp;<em>Anti-Crisis</em>&nbsp;(2013), a crisis ‘marks and generates history’. This is particularly the case for epidemics and pandemics which, unlike other natural disasters such as famines, are not limited to a particular region or moment in time but may come to encompass the whole globe. As the medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40144420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">puts it</a>, disease outbreaks involve a ‘radically different ontological order’, a mode of being that is simultaneously ‘pathological and infectious’. Or to put it another way, one could conceivably outrun a famine but those who try to flee a plague may become unwitting carriers, contaminating new communities and introducing the pathogen to new places.</p>



<p>What is also not widely appreciated is that the roots of the term ‘crisis’ lie in the Ancient Greek word&nbsp;<em>krinô</em>&nbsp;(meaning to separate, choose, cut, decide, judge) and can be traced back to Hippocrates, whose scientific method influenced Thucydides’ approach to history. For the Hippocratic school of medicine, prognosis took precedence over diagnosis, the point being to identify the turning point of a disease in order to intervene and bring about a satisfactory resolution to the illness. Similarly, Thucydides hoped that by tracking the social and moral dissolution that envelopes Athens under the strain of the plague, his history could serve as a ‘great case-book of social pathology’, enabling readers to recognise similar historical patterns in future and intervene so as to restore order and stability. In this way, <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-invention-of-medicine/robin-lane-fox/9780241277058#:~:text=Robin%20Lane%20Fox's%20remarkable%20book,that%20survive%20under%20his%20name." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has been argued</a>, Thucydides applied a medical template to epidemic crises that has coloured our interpretation of them ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-death-and-demographic-change">The Black Death and demographic change</h2>



<p>Perhaps the standout example of the transformative power of disease is the fourteenth century Black Death. Caused by the plague bacillus,&nbsp;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>, the pandemic coincided with the transition from medieval to early modern European society and was greatly enhanced by new shipping networks linking Venice and Genoa with Constantinople, Tunis, London and Bruges. The larger broad-bellied ships required for these long voyages provided perfect conveyances for plague-carrying rats and were soon sparking outbreaks across Europe.</p>



<p>Some scholars claim the pandemic killed a third of Europe’s then population between 1347 and 1353; others say up to one half. Whatever the true mortality there is little doubt the Black Death represented a massive external shock to medieval society and, together with the famines that preceded it, contributed to a declining or stagnant population in Europe for almost 150 years afterwards. The result was a demographic, economic and political crisis.</p>



<p>A smaller population meant less demand for grain putting downward pressure on the price of basic foodstuffs. At the same time, a diminished population fuelled competition, exerting upward pressure on wages and challenging the villeinage system of forced labour that underpinned the feudal system. The result was a wave of popular uprisings across Europe, including the Jacquerie in France in 1358, the revolt of the Florentine&nbsp;<em>Ciompi</em>&nbsp;or wool carders in 1378-82, and the 1381 Peasants’ Revolt in England. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The demands of English peasants included the abolition of an inequitable poll tax and the removal of a statute, passed in the wake of the Black Death, that sought to restrict wages to pre-pandemic levels. The Florentine carders meanwhile demanded a more equitable fiscal policy and the right to establish guilds, fore runners of trade unions. Today, we take collective wage bargaining and trade unions for granted, but in the fourteenth century these demands threatened the basis of the feudal system, hence the observation of the French chronicler Jean Froissart that: ‘Never was any land or realm in such great danger as England at that time.’</p>



<p>This economic levelling also spurred a series of social and cultural changes, including the right of everyone except the lowliest manual worker to wear furs – a privilege that previously had been the preserve of nobles and clerics.&nbsp;In most cases the political reforms were short-lived. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126561.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wat Tyler</a>, the leader of the English rebels, marched to London to petition King Richard II with 60,000 peasants at his back. Demanding that ‘all men should be free and of one condition’, the rebels occupied the Tower of London, ransacked the palaces and mansions of wealthy Londoners, and executed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chief Justice, as well as other hated representatives of the nobility. Within a few weeks Wat Tyler and other leaders of the revolt had been arrested and executed and the crisis was over. Nonetheless, the movement resulted in concessions to peasants: the poll tax was abandoned, and wage bargaining expanded over time, leading to the emergence of a new yeoman class.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-collapse-of-the-aztec-and-incan-empires">The collapse of the Aztec and Incan empires</h2>



<p>Similar claims&nbsp;have been made about the crisis that enveloped the Aztec and Incan empires following the Spanish Conquest of Central and South America in the early sixteenth century. In&nbsp;<em>Plagues and Peoples</em>, McNeill&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plagues-People-William-McNeill/dp/0385121229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that</a>&nbsp;‘disaster is to be expected whenever some previously remote and isolated tribe comes into contact with the outside world and there encounters a series of destructive and demoralizing epidemics.’</p>



<p>In the case of the Aztecs and Inca, the&nbsp;root cause of crisis and societal collapse&nbsp;was the introduction by Columbus and, later, the conquistador Hernan Cortez, of smallpox, measles and other Old World diseases to which Amerindian populations of modern-day Mexico, Guatemala and Peru had little or no immunity. The result was that&nbsp;within a century of Cortes’s arrival in the Gulf of Mexico in 1518 the population of Central Mexico had been reduced, according to some estimates, from 25 million to 1.5 million. A similar demographic …</p></div></div></div>

so that once it's built for the first time, we don't need to rebuild it any more. The integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> will be broken
when the assumption does not hold.</p><p>In this release, we fix the integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> which allows user to change the dependencies.
The fix is well implementend that people who don't do such modifications will not pay for it.</p><p>This is one of the highest desired feature request based on the
<a href="https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/4361#issuecomment-739538789" rel="noopener noreferrer">user feedback</a>, so we will expand a bit here why it is tricky
to implement it without compromising performance.</p><p>In ReScript compilation scheme, dependencies as packages are treated as a blackbox,
changes of dependencies should be <em>transitive</em>. The is due to that we have cross module
optimizations and the binary interface itself is a hash of its dependencies.
So for a package dependency chain: A -&gt; B -&gt; C, if A changes and B does not change, C still needs get rebuilt.
Because the intermediate output of B may still change due to the change of A.
To make things worse, each package comes with an installation process which is a shell script, so re-installation will make the
package look like freshly built.</p><p>In this release, we track the installation in the build graph as well, and we calculate the hash of the installation of dependencies and put it in the
dependent's command line flags for building binary artifacts. Such strategy benefits in such aspects: </p><ul><li><p>The calculation of the hash of installation is almost free since it is just one stat, we don't need track all dependencies' artifacts.</p></li><li><p>The introducion of such hashing does not appear in parsing, so that the changes of dependencies will never trigger re-parsing.</p></li><li><p>Once the package installation is a nop, the transitive rebuild graph will be cut off so that we can save some unneeded rebuild.</p></li><li><p>When people make changes to the depdendencies, if such changes don't change the package interface, it will not trigger the build of its dependents.</p></li></ul><h3>Introducing <code>pinned-dependencies</code><span><span><a href="#introducing-pinned-dependencies"><svg height="0.8em" width="0.8em" viewBox="0 0 20.003 19.944"><path d="M11.927 7.908a4.819 4.819 0 00-3.968-1.3 5.091 5.091 0 00-2.921 1.508L1.47 11.684a4.82 4.82 0 00.192 7.122 4.994 4.994 0 006.76-.4l3.7-3.776a.109.109 0 00-.067-.184s-.649.029-1.132.006a10.116 10.116 0 01-1.35-.226.308.308 0 00-.243.088l-2.529 2.609a2.733 2.733 0 01-3.583.319 2.64 2.64 0 01-.247-3.951l3.755-3.753a2.7 2.7 0 013.654-.073.108.108 0 00.15 0l1.4-1.4a.114.114 0 00-.003-.157z"></path><path d="M8.076 12.036a4.822 4.822 0 003.967 1.3 5.089 5.089 0 002.922-1.509l3.568-3.568a4.818 4.818 0 00-.192-7.121 5 5 0 00-6.761.4l-3.7 3.777a.108.108 0 00.067.183s.648-.028 1.132-.006a10.151 10.151 0 011.35.226.3.3 0 00.243-.088l2.529-2.608a2.732 2.732 0 013.581-.319 2.638 2.638 0 01.249 3.95l-3.755 3.754a2.706 2.706 0 01-3.654.073.107.107 0 00-.15 0l-1.4 1.4a.113.113 0 00.004.156z"></path></svg></a><a id="introducing-pinned-dependencies"></a></span></span></h3><p>To make <code>bsb -make-world</code> more pratical, we also introduce a new concept called: <code>pinned-dependencies</code>.

<p><em>As companies increasingly leverage data to power digital products, drive decision making, and fuel innovation, understanding the health and reliability of these most critical assets is fundamental. For decades, organizations have relied on data catalogs to power data governance. But is that enough?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debashis1saha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Debashis Saha</em></a><em>, VP, Engineering at AppZen, formerly at eBay and Intuit, and </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrmoses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Barr Moses</em></a><em>, CEO and Co-founder of Monte Carlo, discuss why data catalogs aren’t meeting the needs of the modern data stack, and how a new approach – data discovery – is needed to better facilitate metadata management and data reliability.</em> </p>



<p><em><strong>Interested in learning more about Monte Carlo’s approach to data catalogs and metadata management? <a aria-label="Request a demo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://marketing417822.typeform.com/to/D11gk1a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Request a demo</a>.</strong></em></p>



<p>It’s no secret: knowing where your data lives and who has access to it is fundamental to understanding its impact on your business. In fact, when it comes to building <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-like-a-product/">a successful data platform</a>, it’s critical that your data is both organized and centralized, while also easily discoverable.</p>



<p>Analogous to a physical library catalog, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data catalogs</a> serve as an inventory of metadata and give users the information necessary to evaluate data accessibility, health, and location. In our age of <a href="https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/self-service-business-intelligence-BI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-service business intelligence</a>, data catalogs have also emerged as a powerful tool for data management and data governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, for most data leaders, one of their first imperatives is to build a data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the bare minimum, a data catalog should answer:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Where should I look for my data?&nbsp;</li><li>Does this data matter?&nbsp;</li><li>What does this data represent?</li><li>Is this data relevant and important?&nbsp;</li><li>How can I use this data?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Still, as data operations mature and data pipelines become increasingly complex, traditional data catalogs often fall short of meeting these requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s why some of the best data engineering teams are innovating their approach to metadata management – and what they’re doing instead:</p>



<h3>Where data catalogs fall short</h3>



<p>While data catalogs have the ability to document data, the fundamental challenge of allowing users to “discover” and glean meaningful, real-time insights about the health of your data has largely remained unsolved.</p>



<p>Data catalogs as we know them are unable to keep pace with this new reality for three primary reasons: (1) lack of automation, (2) inability to scale with the growth and diversity of your data stack, and (3) their undistributed format.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Increased need for automation</h4>



<p>Traditional data catalogs and governance methodologies typically rely on data teams to do the heavy lifting of manual data entry, holding them responsible for updating the catalog as data assets evolve. This approach is not only time-intensive, but requires significant manual toil that could otherwise be automated, freeing time up for data engineers and analysts to focus on projects that actually move the needle.</p>



<p>As a data professional, understanding the state of your data is a constant battle and speaks to the need for greater, more customized automation. Perhaps this scenario rings a bell:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before stakeholder meetings, do you often find yourself frantically pinging Slack channels to figure out what data sets feed a specific report or model you are using – and why on earth the data stopped arriving last week? To cope with this, do you and your team huddle together in a room and start whiteboarding all of the various connections upstream and downstream for a specific key report?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll spare you the gory details, but it probably looked something like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ph5m59aRfL8owiafVZisgcTG1f0-zrOXWZObUv243HS9i3Gb1uSXXEv9bWOmROiTV8cL2GhNivW5hk8P9SQG3v6NploRM15l7f9s5R6xfbIBxAjPvHCLteV65jQqhhOcT8aXDD0Z" alt="" width="800" height="497"><figcaption><em>Does your data lineage look like a storm of lines and arrows? That makes two (hundred) of us. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock</a>.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If this hits home, you’re not alone. Many companies that need to solve this dependency jigsaw puzzle embark on a multi-year process to manually map out all their data assets. Some are able to dedicate resources to build short-term hacks or even in-house tools that allow them to search and explore their data. Even if it gets you to the end goal, this poses a heavy burden on the data organization, costing your data engineering team time and money that could have been spent on other things, like product development or actually using the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Ability to scale as data changes</h4>



<p>Data catalogs work well when data is structured, but in 2020, that’s not always the case. As machine-generated data increases and companies invest in ML initiatives, unstructured data is becoming more and more common, accounting for <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3406806/ai-unleashes-the-power-of-unstructured-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 90 percent of all new data produced</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-choosing-a-cloud-data-warehouse-3de66862f41c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typically stored in data lakes</a>, unstructured data does not have a predefined model and must go through multiple transformations to be usable and useful. Unstructured data is very dynamic, with its shape, source, and meaning changing all the time as it goes through various phases of processing, including transformation, modeling, and aggregation. What we do with this unstructured data (i.e., transform, model, aggregate, and visualize it), makes it much more difficult to catalog in its “desired state.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, rather than simply <em>describing</em> the data that consumers access and use, there’s a growing need to also <em>understand</em> the data based on its intention and purpose. How a producer of data might describe an asset would be very different from how a consumer of this data understands its function, and even between one consumer of data to another there might be a vast difference in terms of understanding the meaning ascribed to the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, a data set pulled from Salesforce has a completely different meaning to a data engineer than it would to someone on the sales team. While the engineer would understand what “DW_7_V3” means, the sales team would be scratching their heads, trying to determine if said data set correlated to their “Revenue Forecasts 2021” dashboard in Salesforce. And the list goes on.</p>



<p>Static data descriptions are limited by nature. In 2021, we must accept and adapt to these new and evolving dynamics to truly understand the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Data is distributed; catalogs are not&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Despite the distribution of the modern data architecture (see: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up-210710bb41e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data mesh</a>) and the move towards embracing semi-structured and unstructured data as the norm, most data catalogs still treat data like a one-dimensional entity. As data is aggregated and transformed, it flows through different elements of the data stack, making it nearly impossible to document.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png" alt="" width="623" height="482" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png 623w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"><figcaption><em>Traditional data catalogs manage metadata (data about your data) at the ingest state, but data is constantly changing, making it hard to understand the health of your data as it evolves in the pipeline. Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Nowadays, data tends to be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/self-describing-messages#:~:text=A%20message%20that%20contains%20data,consists%20of%20tag%2Fvalue%20pairs." target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-describing</a>, containing both the data and the metadata that describes the format and meaning of that data in a single package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since traditional data catalogs are not distributed, it’s near to impossible to use as a central source of truth about your data. This problem will only grow as data becomes more accessible to a wider variety of users, from BI analysts to operations teams, and the pipelines powering ML, operations, and analytics become increasingly complex.</p>



<p>A modern data catalog needs to federate the meaning of data across these domains. Data teams need to be able to understand how these data domains relate to each other and what aspects of the aggregate view are important. They need a centralized way to answer these distributed questions as a whole – in other words, a distributed, federated data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in the right approach to building a data catalog from the outset will allow you to build a better data platform that helps your team democratize and easily explore data, allowing you to keep tabs on important data assets and harness their full potential.</p>



<h3>Data Catalog 2.0 = Data Discovery</h3>



<p>Data catalogs work well when you have rigid models, but as data pipelines grow increasingly complex and unstructured data becomes the golden standard, our understanding of this data (what it does, who uses it, how it’s used, etc.) does not reflect reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that next generation catalogs will have the capabilities to learn, understand, and infer the data, enabling users to leverage its insights in a self-service manner. But how do we get there?&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png" alt="" width="624" height="486" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png 624w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"><figcaption><em>Data discovery can replace the modern data catalog by providing distributed, real-time insights about data across different domains, all while abiding by a central set of governance standards.&nbsp;</em> Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In addition to cataloging data, metadata and data management strategies must also incorporate data discovery, a new approach to understanding the health of your distributed data assets in real-time. Borrowing from the distributed domain-oriented architecture proposed by Zhamak Deghani and Thoughtworks’ <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>data mesh model</strong>,</a> data discovery posits that different data owners are held accountable for their data as products, as well as for facilitating communication between distributed data across different locations. Once data has been served to and transformed by a given domain, the domain data owners can leverage the data for their operational or analytic needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data discovery replaces the need for a data catalog by providing a domain-specific, dynamic understanding of your data based on how it’s being ingested, stored, aggregated, and used by a set of specific consumers. As with a data catalog, governance standards and tooling are federated across these domains (allowing for greater accessibility and interoperability), but unlike a data catalog, data discovery surfaces a real-time understanding of the data’s current state as opposed to it’s ideal or “cataloged” state.</p>



<p>Data discovery can answer these questions not just for the data’s ideal state but for the current state of the data across each domain:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The price of bitcoin is headed back over $19,000 again. What will it take to push it past $20,000—more tethers? More institutional buying? Or maybe, more crypto journalists proclaiming (without evidence) that tethers are fully backed? Here’s the news: </p>



<h2>MicroStrategy wants more, more, more</h2>



<p>Michael Saylor, the new crazy god of bitcoin institutional buying, continues his bitcoin buying spree. He seems really, really confident the price of BTC will go up. </p>



<p>Saylor’s publicly traded company MicroStrategy currently owns 40,824 bitcoins—because no sense using all that excess cash for buying back a ton of stock or paying a big dividend. Better off to gamble it on crypto. </p>



<p>Now the firm is actually going into debt to buy bitcoin. After completing a $650 million bond offering, MicroStrategy plans to plow all the proceeds into buying more bitcoin. (<a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/company/company-videos/microstrategy-completes-650-million-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes">Microstrategy PR</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-completes-650-million-bond-sale-to-finance-next-bitcoin-purchase">Cointelegraph</a>)</p>



<p>Citibank isn’t impressed. Analyst Tyler Radke downgraded MicroStrategy (MSTR) from neutral to sell, calling the recent rally—MSTR went up after its first few BTC buying announcements—”overextended” and a possibly “deal-breaker” for software investors. (<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/87054/citi-microstrategy-stock-downgrade-bitcoin">The Block</a>)</p>



<h2>Tether: Ain’t no stopping us now</h2>



<p>Tether is now at <a href="https://archive.is/wip/aITvG">$20 billion worth of tether</a>—that’s assets, but circulating supply is soon to follow—and there is no evidence whatsoever to conclude that there is $20 billion in real cash behind all those tethers.&nbsp;Why? Because the company has never had a formal audit. &nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="5023" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/piles-of-money/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg" data-orig-size="600,450" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="piles-of-money" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=600" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=600" alt="" width="384" height="288" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=384 384w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=150 150w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Still, last month, The Block’s Larry Cermak <a href="https://twitter.com/ahcastor/status/1338273950078398465">defended tethers</a> as being “either fully backed or very, very close,” telling folks “everything is in order now.” He based that on conversations he claimed to have had with “third-parties” who told him they had successfully redeemed several hundred million in tethers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cermak is not the only one to buy the Tether line of B.S. </p>



<p>In December 2018, after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/crypto-mystery-clues-suggest-tether-has-the-billions-it-promised">looking at Tether bank statements</a>, Bloomberg’s Matt Leising also reported that Tether appeared to be fully backed. He was wrong.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to him at the time, in the previous two months, the DOJ froze five NY bank accounts <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/02/the-us-government-wants-man-at-the-center-of-massive-cryptocurrency-scheme-held-without-bail/">belonging to Reginald Fowler</a>, who ran a shadow banking service for Tether/Bitfinex’s Panamanian payment processor. And in November, the NYAG, having serious concerns about Tether’s finances, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company">issued subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether</a> asking for details on their banking. Finally, in April 2019, Tether admitted it was only <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents">74% backed</a>. And that’s before it went off and printed another 17.5 billion tethers. So what’s backing all those?  </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/12/13/tether-is-too-big-to-fail-the-entire-crypto-industry-utterly-depends-on-it/">blog post</a>, David Gerard explains why Tether is “too big to fail.” Essentially, it’s keeping the entire BTC market afloat. If Tether were to get the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a>, the price of bitcoin is unlikely to ever recover. </p>



<p>Thus, “the purpose of the crypto industry, and all its little service sub-industries, is to generate a narrative—so as to maintain and enhance the flow of actual dollars from suckers, and keep the party going,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>NYAG: Tether documents forthcoming</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, there’s been a new document filing in the NYAG Tether probe.<a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG"> </a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">letter</a> to the Supreme Court, NYAG says Bitfinex/Tether are cooperating on document production and the parties expect to finalize things “in the coming weeks.” These documents, of course, consist of everything NYAG asked for in its original November 2018 subpoena—information that will shed light on the Tether and Bitfinex’s shadowy dealings since 2015. </p>



<p>A part of me wants to get excited about this news, but another part says, wait a minute. In the past when Tether’s operators said they were going to hand documents over, they simply handed over material that was already public information. They also have a <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/">long history</a> of shenanigans, so let’s just wait and see.  </p>



<h2><strong>How to turn USDT into cash&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Jorge Stolfi, a computer scientist from Brazil, shared on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/kbf5jj/yes_here_we_are_holy_shit_weve_done_it_our_boi/gfmqa1o/">Reddit</a> a “mainstream theory” on what could be happening behind-the-scenes at Tether—specifically, how Tether’s operators could convert USDT into cash for their own personal use. Remember, this is totally unproven. It is just a theory. (The “triad,” by the way, refers to Tether CSO Phil Potter, CEO and <a href="https://archive.is/DfBMP">man of mystery</a>&nbsp;J.L. van der Velde,&nbsp;and CFO Giancarlo Devasini. They are the same operators behind sister company Bitfinex.)</p>



<p>He writes:</p>



<ol><li>The owners of Tether Inc (which I will call “the Triad”) print billions of USDT without any backing.</li><li>The Triad deposits those USDT into Bitfinex (which they own too).</li><li>The Triad uses those USDT to buy BTC and other cryptos from other Bitfinex clients, attracted by the better price.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the BTC to their private wallets.</li><li>The Triad moves all or some of those BTC to other exchanges that handle real currencies, such as USD, EUR, JPY, etc.</li><li>The Triad sells those BTC for real money.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the real money into their personal bank accounts.</li></ol>



<p>This is a theory. This is not proven. But the point is, when you have no checks and balances in place along with massive loopholes in oversight, <em>anything</em> can happen. We <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/02/12/how-the-hell-did-we-get-here-a-timeline-of-quadrigacx-events/">saw this</a> already with QuadrigaCX—the Canadian crypto exchange that went bankrupt after the founder disappeared (aka “died in India”), taking along with him hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds.  </p>



<h2>Coinbase loses half critical security team</h2>



<p>After NYT reporter Nathaniel Popper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html">reported</a> about discriminatory complaints at Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1336072433091059712">new information came out</a>. Among those who recently resigned to protest the exchange’s new internal policies, were four of the seven people on Coinbase’s critical security team—aka the “key management team.” </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>New detail on how the turmoil at Coinbase has hit the company's efforts to secure its Bitcoins.</p><p>Among the people who resigned this fall – to protest new internal policies – were 4 of the 7 people on the most critical security team, the "key management team," sources told me.</p></div>— Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1336072433091059712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The key management team is responsible for securing the cryptographic keys to Coinbase’s cold wallets, where the majority of the company’s crypto is held—somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 billion. </p>



<p>“No job is more fundamental to the company’s success,” Popper said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase’s security chief <a href="https://twitter.com/SecurityGuyPhil/status/1336082099376287745">shot back</a>, saying Coinbase’s security team is managed by several teams with redundancy built in. Of course, he wants us to believe everything is fine, but not everyone is convinced. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LOL what "most of the key management team for Coinbase's cold wallets quit" is absolutely not a "nothingburger"</p>— Tony “Abolish (Pol)ICE” Arcieri 🦀 (@bascule) <a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1336091775367188481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>MassMutual invests in BTC</h2>



<p>Bitcoin has a new institutional investor: MassMutual. The Springfield-Mass insurance firm purchased $100 million worth of BTC for its general investment account, which totals $235 billion. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massmutual-joins-the-bitcoin-club-with-100-million-purchase-11607626800">WSJ</a>)</p>



<p>MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through NYDIG, a New York-based fund management company, which has  $2.3 billion worth of crypto under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG.</p>



<p>The $100 million cash injection into bitcoin sounds like a lot, but it’s small potatoes. That money will cover the network’s operators—the bitcoin miners—for only six days. Remember, bitcoin miners are selling their 900 newly minted bitcoin per day for $17 million, at current BTC prices. Investors will never see that money again. Bitcoin doesn’t make any real profits on its own—just investor money going in one end, out the other. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been writing JSON-REST APIs in Python for a number of years, and over that time I've found the tooling has greatly improved. To show you how you can benefit I'm going to show you how I've evolved. However, if you want to skip to the tooling I use today take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-schema">Quart-Schema</a>.</p> <p>Writing JSON-REST APIs in Python using Flask/Quart has always been pleasent. Yet communicating the API structure (routes, data, etc) to third parties and to my future self has not been. It is also difficult to guarantee that the API works as the documentation says it does. This has resulted in isses, bugs and misuse, in production I'd love to have avoided.</p> <p>I think I would have avoided these if the APIs I wrote,</p> <ul> <li>ensured that any data received or sent matched the communicated structure,</li> <li>communicated their structure using standardised documentation, specifically <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>,</li> <li>were setup such that linting checks informed me if I made any mistakes,</li> <li>took less effort to write (whilst acheiving these aims).</li> </ul> <h2 id="initial-flask-setup">Initial Flask setup</h2> <p>This is a simple example of how I used to write a Flask APIs,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which works very nicely, but meet none of my aims. Both myself and third party user would have to read the code to understand what is sent and returned by the API.</p> <p>It also does not help to know when the wrong data has been sent. For example <code>due</code> should be a date but if it isn't the <code>create_todo</code> function will raise a <code>ValueError</code> resulting in the API returning a 500 response. It should return a 400 response so that the third party and I can tell that it is an error with the data rather than a server or programming issue.</p> <h2 id="flask-with-docstrings">Flask with docstrings</h2> <p>In an attempt to solve the documentation problem experienced with the simple Flask setup I tried the <a href="https://sphinxcontrib-httpdomain.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">sphinx autohttp extensions</a>,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    <span>"""Create a TODO task.

    .. :quickref: Create a TODO.

    :reqheader Accept: application/json
    :&lt;json string task: task description
    :&lt;json string due: todo due date
    :&gt;json int id: todo unique identifier
    :&gt;json string task: task description
    :&gt;json string due: todo due date
    :resheader Content-Type: application/json
    :status 201: post created
    """</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which enables documentation to be created by manually specifying the data structures in the docstring.</p> <p>Whilst this helps with the documentation it has the same issues as the simpler Flask example, in that it doesn't validate the data sent to the route, nor the data returned. It also doesn't help with any linters, for example a simple typo like <code>data["duo"]</code> would only raise an error during testing, or worse in production.</p> <p>The bigger issue though, is writing the docstring documentation as it is time consuming, boring work that I (and my colleagues) would forget to do. Over time this lead to the documentation being wrong leading to distrust and lack of use.</p> <p>I eventually stopped using this technique and reverted to the simpler example as this documentation ended up actively misleading. It also became clear that the winning documentation standard was OpenAPI, rather than sphinx documentation.</p> <h2 id="aside-switch-to-quart">Aside switch to Quart</h2> <p>It was around this time in that I switched from writing APIs in Flask to writing them in <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart">Quart</a>. The snippets onwards in this article will now assume Quart, but the only difference is the use of async/await keywords, you can remove them to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <p>I wrote Quart as I wanted to start using the <code>async</code> <code>await</code> keywords and libraries. You can remove <code>async</code>, <code>await</code> from the examples to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <h2 id="jsonschema-decorators">JSONSchema decorators</h2> <p>The data sent and received in the APIs I write is formatted as JSON. This means a <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSONSchema</a> could be used to describe the structure and used to validate that any data matches it. This allows me to write decorators that accept JSONSchemas to validate request and response data,</p> <pre><code><span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> wraps
<span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> Any, Callable, Dict

<p>Some time ago, I wrote a blog post about how <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/24/pointers-and-bytes.html">there’s more to a pointer than meets the eye</a>.
One key point I was trying to make is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal in the sense that they can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “extra information” that distinguishes different pointers to the same address is typically called <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#pointer-provenance"><em>provenance</em></a>.
This post is another attempt to convince you that provenance is “real”, by telling a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when provenance is not considered sufficiently carefully in an optimizing compiler.
The post is self-contained; I am not assuming that you have read the first one.
There is also a larger message here about how we could prevent such issues from coming up in the future by spending more effort on the specification of compiler IRs.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>Below, I will show a series of three compiler transformations that each seem “intuitively justified”, but when taken together they lead to a clearly incorrect result.
I will use LLVM for these examples, but the goal is not to pick on LLVM—other compilers suffer from similar issues.
The goal is to convince you that to build a correct compiler for languages permitting unsafe pointer manipulation such as C, C++, or Rust,
we need to take IR semantics (and specifically provenance) more seriously.
I use LLVM for the examples because it is particularly easy to study with its single, extensively-documented IR that a lot of infrastructure evolved around.
Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-why-irs-need-a-precise-semantics">Warm-up: Why IRs need a precise semantics</h2>

<p>As a warm-up, I will give a simple example showing that compiler IRs such as LLVM IR need a precise (and precisely documented) semantics.
If you are already familiar with the idea of treating compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, or if you are just here for the pointers and their provenance, you can skip to the next section.</p>

<p>Consider the following simple (and contrived, for the sake of this example) piece of C code computing <code>n * (i+j)</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One transformation the compiler might want to do is to move the addition <code>i+j</code> out of the loop, to avoid computing the sum each time around the loop (this is called “loop-invariant code motion”<sup id="fnref:loop" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:loop">1</a></sup>):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// optimized version</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, that transformation is actually incorrect.
If we imagine a caller using this function as <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, then this is a perfectly correct way to call <code>sum_up</code>: the loop is never entered, so the overflowing addition <code>INT_MAX+1</code> is never performed.
However, after the desired optimization, the program now causes a signed integer overflow, which is UB (Undefined Behavior) and thus May Never Happen!</p>

<p>One might be tempted to ignore this problem because the UB on integer overflow is a compiler-only concept; every target supported by the compiler will do the obvious thing and just produce an overflowing result.
However, there might be other compiler passes running after the optimization we are considering.
One such pass might inline <code>sum_up</code>, and another pass might notice the <code>INT_MAX+1</code> and replace it by <code>unreachable</code> since UB code is “by definition” unreachable, and another pass might then just remove all our code since it is unreachable.
Each of these passes has a good reason to exist (it can help real code become a lot faster or help prune dead code), but if we combine them all with loop-invariant code motion, the result is a disaster.</p>

<p>One way (and the only systematic way I know) to avoid such problems is to make sure that we can justify the correctness of each optimization <em>in isolation</em>.
Each optimization must be <em>correct</em> for any possible program, where <em>correct</em> means that the optimized program must only “do things” that the original program could have done as well.
(This is basically the “as-if” rule in the C standard, and is typically called “refinement” in the academic literature.)
In particular, no optimization must ever introduce UB into a UB-free program.</p>

<p>It may seem now that under this premise, it is impossible to perform the loop-invariant code motion we are considering.
But that is not the case!
So far, what we have seen is that the optimization is not <em>correct</em> when being performed on a C program.
But when LLVM performs these optimizations, it does not consider the program to be written in C—it considers the program to be written in LLVM IR, which has a different semantics than C.
Specifically, the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM LangRef</a> says that signed integer overflow in LLVM IR yields a <code>poison</code> value.
It is not UB to produce <code>poison</code>, it is just UB to use <code>poison</code> in certain ways (the details of this do not matter here).
In a call to the optimized <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, the <code>s</code> variable introduced by loop-invariant code motion is unused, so the fact that its value is <code>poison</code> does not matter!</p>

<p>Due to this behavior of signed integer overflow, this case of loop-invariant code motion is <em>correct</em> if we consider it as an optimization on programs that are written in LLVM IR.<sup id="fnref:cheat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cheat">2</a></sup>
The “price” we pay for this is that replacing <code>INT_MAX+1</code> by <code>unreachable</code> is not <em>correct</em> in LLVM IR, since it is not UB.</p>

<p>The great thing about <em>correct</em> optimizations is that we can combine any number of them in any order (such as inlining, replacing definite UB by <code>unreachable</code>, and removing unreachable code), and we can be sure that the result obtained after all these optimizations is a correct compilation of our original program.
(In the academic lingo, we would say that “refinement is transitive”.)</p>

<p>However, to make the argument that an optimization is <em>correct</em>, the exact semantics of LLVM IR (what the behavior of all possible programs is and when they have UB) needs to be documented.
All involved optimizations need to exactly agree on what is and is not UB, to ensure that whatever code they produce will not be considered UB by a later optimization.
This is exactly what we also expect from the specification of a programming language such as C, which is why I think we should consider compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, and specify them with the same diligence as we would specify “normal” languages.<sup id="fnref:ub-difference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ub-difference">3</a></sup>
Sure, no human is going to write many programs in LLVM IR, so their syntax barely matters, but clang and rustc produce LLVM IR programs all the time, and as we have seen understanding the exact rules governing the behavior of programs is crucial to ensuring that the optimizations LLVM performs do not change program behavior.</p>

<p><em>Take-away:</em> If we want to be able to justify the correctness of a compiler in a modular way, considering only one optimization at a time, we need to perform these optimizations in an IR that has a precise specification of all aspects of program behavior, including UB.
Then we can, for each optimization separately, consider the question: does the optimization ever change program behavior, and does it ever introduce UB into UB-free programs?
For a <em>correct</em> optimization, the answer to these questions is “no”.</p>

<h2 id="how-3-seemingly-correct-optimizations-can-be-incorrect-when-used-together">How 3 (seemingly) correct optimizations can be incorrect when used together</h2>

<p>With the warm-up done, we are now ready to consider some more tricky optimizations, which we will use to explore the question of how precise a language specification needs to be.
We will look at three different optimizations LLVM can perform, and I will show that they <em>cannot all be correct</em> since the first and last program we are considering actually have <em>different behavior</em>.
(More precisely: the last program has a possible behavior that was not possible for the first program.)
This is only possible if at least one optimization changed program behavior in an incorrect way, but it is actually not entirely clear which optimization is the culprit.</p>

<p>The sequence of examples is taken from <a href="https://sf.snu.ac.kr/llvmtwin/files/presentation.pdf#page=32">this talk</a> by Chung-Kil Hur; it was discovered while working on a mathematically rigorous specification of LLVM.</p>

<p>Here is the source program:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I am using C syntax here just as a convenient way to write programs in LLVM IR.</p>

<p>This program has two possible behaviors: either <code>ip</code> (the address one-past-the-end of <code>p</code>) and <code>iq</code> (the address of <code>q</code>) are different, and nothing is printed.
Or the two are equal, in which case the program will print “10” (<code>iq</code> is the result of casting <code>q</code> to an integer, so casting it back will yield the original pointer, or at least a pointer pointing to the same object / location in memory).</p>

<p>The first “optimization” we will perform is to exploit that if we enter the <code>if</code> body, we have <code>iq == ip</code>, so we can replace all <code>iq</code> by <code>ip</code>.
Subsequently the definition of <code>ip</code> is inlined:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second optimization notices that we are taking a pointer <code>p+1</code>, casting it to an integer, and casting it back, so we can remove the cast roundtrip:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The final optimization notices that <code>q</code> is never written to, so we can replace <code>q[0]</code> by its initial value <code>0</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this final program is different from the first one!
Specifically, the final program will either print nothing or print “0”, while the original program <em>could never print “0”</em>.
This shows that the sequence of three optimizations we performed, as a whole, is <em>not correct</em>.</p>

				<h2 id="i">I</h2><p>In this small addendum to my essay <em><a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">The Story of COVID-19 in Sweden</a>,</em> we want to look at a very surprising statistic: the number of annual deaths in Sweden.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png" alt="" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1402w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/"><em>Number of deaths in Sweden from 2010 to 2020</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>You can find the original excel file published by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Sweden">SCB</a>—the official government agency for statistics in Sweden—<a href="https://www.scb.se/en/About-us/news-and-press-releases/statistics-sweden-to-publish-preliminary-statistics-on-deaths-in-sweden/">here</a>. The most striking aspect of these figures is, of course, the fact that there were no more deaths in Sweden this year than in any other year. (The year is not over yet, but it is almost impossible that the number of deaths will increase so much that 2020 will be a year with significantly more deaths.) And remember, Sweden did not have lockdowns nor mandatory mask laws.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I got the idea to look at the Sweden’s annual deaths statistic because a friend of mine showed me the <a href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Querschnitt/Corona/_Grafik/_Interaktiv/woechentliche-sterbefallzahlen-jahre.html?nn=209016">same statistic for Germany</a>. In Germany, as in Sweden, the number of deaths this year is not higher than in other years, but for Germany, this fact could <em>theoretically</em> be explained by lockdowns and masks. Not so for Sweden.</p><p>Someone I showed these figures to suggested that although masks were not mandatory in Sweden, perhaps everyone wore them anyway. To me, this idea immediately sounded ridiculous, and it looks like I was right.</p><p><a href="http://www.coviddatahub.com/">A survey</a> asking participants whether they wore face masks in the last seven days to protect themselves from COVID-19 found that, for example, at the end of April, in the middle of the first COVID-19 wave, 82% of Swedes never wore a face mask. This is in stark contrast to, say, Germany, where only 8% did not wear a mask.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3034b31e-bf36-4d94-a52e-c9532b9465dc/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1440w"></figure><p>The latest survey—November 9. - 15.—tells the same story.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/668bfaf9-ce60-4785-85e8-88f20cad8fa1/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1428w"></figure><p>If you look at this statistic throughout the year, you will see that in Sweden, almost nobody wore face masks, while in Germany, almost everyone did. So what is going on here? How can they not wear masks without a high number of annual deaths? Where are those <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/">7,500 COVID-19 deaths</a>?</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>To get a better picture of what happened in Sweden, we need to look at the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/">weekly number of deaths</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3af0303f-5d7a-4975-8ac0-2900d83b954b/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1342w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/"><em>Average daily number of deaths per week in Sweden in 2020, compared to the average daily number of deaths per week from 2015 to 2019</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see here, the first half of 2020 was an exceptionally deadly year. After that, and especially now, Sweden compares favorably with other years.</p><p>My explanation for this is simple: most people who would normally have died in the winter from viruses and diseases—especially the flu—died in the spring from COVID-19. This can happen because the groups at risk from these viruses appear to be similar. However, for my explanation to be true, (1) the number of influenza deaths in Sweden would have to be lower than in other years, and (2) COVID-19 would have to have a case-fatality rate (CFR) that is in the ballpark of influenza.</p><p>Requirement number one fits the data from other countries like the U.S., where flu deaths have dropped by two-thirds, as this New York Post article titled <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/24/drop-in-flu-deaths-may-indicate-that-most-at-risk-died-from-covid-19/">Drop in flu deaths may indicate that most at risk died from COVID-19</a></em> states:</p><blockquote>Flu deaths are down two-thirds from the five-year average, a drop that could indicate the most vulnerable Americans died in the first wave of COVID-19.</blockquote><p>If anyone can find good data on the number of deaths from influenza and other diseases for 2020 in Sweden, I would greatly appreciate a comment or Twitter DM.</p><p>Condition number two—the low CFR—is something I discussed in my other <a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">essay</a>. It is still not clear how deadly COVID-19 really is, but estimates are getting lower every time new data comes in, so I do not think this is unlikely.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>Whatever the explanation for the low number of annual deaths, it seems that Sweden has done “fine” without lockdowns and masks. Something I think few people would have expected, given how things are portrayed in the media—but that's a different essay. If you have another, perhaps better, explanation for these figures, feel free to suggest it in the comments.</p><p>And as always, thank you for reading my essay.</p>

            <p>The Program audio series is a fiction podcast I write, direct, edit, and produce. Fans have described it as “love child of Black Mirror and NPR”. It’s made on zero budget and has so far received over 130,000 downloads.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/1.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I described how The Program came to be and how it launched in <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results/">my first blog post</a> back in April, so if you’re an aspiring podcaster make sure you check out the first instalment as well. We’re picking up where that article left off - and just like last time, mistakes made &amp; lessons learned are in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

            <h3>US store feature</h3>

            <p>Hands down, the most important promotional vehicle for The Program so far has been Apple Podcasts. In the first 6 months since The Program’s release, they featured the show in 5 countries - Canada, Australia &amp; New Zealand, and the UK &amp; Ireland. Then in June I finally obtained the jewel in the crown - no, not India, but a spotlight in Apple Podcasts US. Noticing that The Program hadn’t been included in their newly established “Immersive Fiction” category, I notified Apple’s partner for Canada of the travesty. With tensions between the US and Canada already running high because of the steel tariffs, the matter was brought directly to Trudeau and Trump, and a compromise was soon reached: The Program will be listed as the number 1 show in “Immersive Fiction”, and Canada will concede their security council seat at the UN.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/2.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>Having been featured for almost 6 months now, I’m quite confident that at least half of my daily downloads is attributable to the giant from Cupertino. Spotify however remains elusive, so if anybody reading this can lend a good word please <a href="mailto:ims@programaudioseries.com">contact me</a> and help avert another international crisis.</p>

            <h3>Change of hosting</h3>

            <p>Earlier this year, my hosting provider <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/">Wooshkaa</a> changed their strategy and decided to cater to established podcasting partners - which makes sense seeing that they provide power features such as IAB certification. However, for me this meant my hosting charges would go from zero to $100 per month, which just didn’t make sense seeing that The Program’s still a money-losing operation (turns out audio drama is not the most lucrative of fields - if this were a Medium post, it’d be the highlighted section).</p>

            <p>So I switched to <a href="https://redcircle.com/">RedCircle</a>, <strong>a podcast host that’s not only free, but also boasts cool extra features</strong> such as built-in capability to accept listener donations, cross-promotion with other shows, and dynamically inserted ads - a feature I haven’t taken advantage of yet, but which brings us to a topic that seems to be quite popular.</p>

            <h3>Monetization</h3>

            <p>More than one person has asked me why I haven’t mentioned the monetary aspect in my first article (two - it was two persons). The answer is simple: back then there was no monetary aspect to talk about. At the time, the only way to support the show was to chip in a few bucks at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">buymeacoffee.com</a> - a service which seemed like an affable alternative to Patreon. However, as the builders of our civilization remarked, nomen est omen - while I was able to get a bit recurring revenue on buymeacoffee, most people treated it as a tip jar. Which is perfectly fine, since my motivation for making The Program was and is deeply intrinsic. I was becoming aware however, that in order for the show to grow I had to start generating at least some income from it - if only to compensate my collaborators who contribute their time and energy into the endeavour.</p>

            <p>So at the end of September I introduced <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/support/">five more ways to give to the show</a> with the promise of bonus material to supporters (one mini-episode and two alternative endings that were previously available to everybody). Here are the results:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://liberapay.com/Program/">Liberapay</a>: crickets</li>
                <li>Bitcoin: 1 donation sent from a friend to test the wallet</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/programaudioseries">Paypal</a>: 2 donations</li>
                <li>Interac: 3 donations</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/programaudioseries">Patreon</a>: 29 patrons pledging $125 per month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Which goes to show that <strong>Patreon is king</strong>. Which stupefies me, because for the life of me I don’t see what’s so special about it - as far as I can tell, people don’t use Patreon to find new content, meaning the service itself is not bringing me subscribers. Sure, I guess it’s true Patreon was the first site that successfully attracted people with disposable income and persuaded them to financially support content creators. But to now take a 20% cut in perpetuity (which is how much payment, platform, and payout fees deduct) seems like pure rent-seeking to me. This, combined with the fact that all these platforms are accountable only to themselves, is why I’m strategically building a relationship with my patrons exclusively through email, which is how I dispense bonus content (until a Silicon Valley company inevitably figures out how to insert themselves between people’s emails in order to extract profit).</p>

            <p>One more way I tried to raise money for the show was by selling merch. I initially looked at <a href="http://teepublic.com/">Teepublic</a> for this, but ultimately opted for the <strong>combination of <a href="http://printful.com/">Printful</a> integrated with <a href="https://launchcart.com/">LaunchCart</a>, as it offered more customization and the ability to set my own profit margins</strong>. The result is The Program’s <a href="https://store.programaudioseries.com/">official store</a>, where I sold a whopping 4 items. However, I do feel like I’ve got myself to blame for that, as I don’t think I’ve done my best to create compelling products, and I plan to give it another go later on - but I’m definitely <strong>putting merch on hold until my audience grows much bigger</strong>.</p>

            <p>While I still haven’t inserted ads into the show (and at this point have no plans to), I was able to attract the show’s first sponsor: a lovely lad by the name of Boris and his company <a href="https://atlasauthority.com/">Atlas Authority</a> reached out and bought the show the recording equipment, allowing us to own the means of production and bringing the global class struggle one step closer to its end. Boris shrewdly realized that investing in the show now - while probably not making most sense from the strict numbers perspective - assures that his message will be heard in the years to come with exactly the kind of audience his Atlassian consulting company wants to attract. And if The Program crashes and burns, hey, at least they supported something that brings joy to people, versus giving money to Mark Zuckerberg. Speak of the devil...</p>

            <h3>Social media</h3>

            <p>Early on I made the decision not to promote The Program on any properties owned by Facebook, which probably hurts the show, but helps me live with myself. The two networks I am active on are Twitter and Reddit.</p>

            <p>The two couldn’t be more different. From my experience, Twitter is where the rich and the famous pontificate to the masses and no real communication takes place. Despite making original content for over a year now, I had little success either getting new listeners or building any sense of a community. I still post there but mostly because I enjoy making <a href="https://twitter.com/TheProgramAS/status/1274740157854466049">illustrated quotes</a> from the show and I don’t know where else to publish these. But my point stands that <strong>I do not recommend spending time on Twitter if your goal is to organically promote an audio drama</strong>.</p>

            <p>Being a part of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programaudioseries/">reddit</a> on the other hand has been nothing but pleasure. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgramAudioSeries/">The Program’s subreddit</a> facilitated some great discussions, allowed me to get valuable feedback, and most definitely promoted the show to new audiences. Especially valuable was the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/">r/audiodrama</a>, adeptly moderated by Hitch42, which is shaping into <strong>a must place to promote any audio fiction</strong>. I also gained quite a number of downloads from a post I was allowed to publish in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/">r/blackmirror</a> that compared the two shows (still waiting for someone to call Black Mirror “The Program you watch instead of listening to”).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/3.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I definitely shouldn’t forget to mention HackerNews crowd again, not only for being so kind to repeatedly upvote and promote The Program’s threads, but also for being a wonderful resource and a constant source of inspiration (incidentally, it also has an absolutely masterful moderator going under the moniker dang, offering further proof that mods are the secret ingredient to successful online communities).</p>

            <h3>Contributors</h3>

            <p>During the course of the year, my collaboration with <a href="http://christienledroit.ca/">Christien Ledroit</a>, a super talented musician (and incidentally a neighbour), grew ever more fruitful. Chris so far supplied music for five episodes, three of which he fully scored - in some cases actually facilitating the episode to transpire (for example, I wouldn’t have made <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/14-more-parrot-than-predator/">More parrot than predator</a> were it not for Chris who created the soundscape that comes alive in synch with the A.I. from the story). Chris is currently scoring three more episodes in various stages of production, so expect to hear many more of his fine works.</p>

            <p>The music that isn’t made specifically for the show mostly comes from <a href="https://www.neosounds.com/">Neosounds</a>, a royalty-free website I can <strong>absolutely recommend for the quality of their tunes and ease of use</strong>, and also because they have been generous enough to kindly extend the discount they provided to this poor producer (cost of music is the main reason the show is still not profitable even with the supporters and owning the equipment).</p>

            <p>On the visual side of things, the show’s artist <a href="https://en.cdacosta.art/">Carlos Costa</a> continues to amaze with his official illustrations, depicting three more episodes and creating new show art (which you can see at the top of the page).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/4.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>While mentioning contributors, I would be remiss to not mention all the wonderful actors who have literally given The Program a voice. A lot of them became frequent collaborators and you can find out more about them not only in the show’s credits available at this website, …</p></div></div>

                    <p><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/"><strong>S</strong>olarWinds</a>' credentials exposure from 2019 gives an important clue to how the breach at FireEye and US government possibly took place. It sheds light over a very important aspect that organizations often ignore – their insecure practices and inefficiency in securing credentials. <a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a> has identified weak credentials in hundreds of organizations over the course of years that we tested or, engaged in pentest with, and the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> breach seems to be just another case of gross carelessness and weak credentials. Although not confirmed by official sources, this is what we can conjecture for now. This reveals a very important piece of the puzzle, that is &nbsp;the attack was possibly not as sophisticated as it was reported to be.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">official blog post published yesterday</a>, FireEye said a "<em>highly evasive attacker </em>by <em>leveraging SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with SUNBURST Backdoor". </em>The original blog post from FireEye has been linked below</p><figure><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html"><div><p>Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to CompromiseMultiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor</p><p>We have discovered a global intrusion campaign, and we are tracking the actors behind this campaign as UNC2452.</p><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/brand/logos/fireeye.ico"><span>FireEye</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/fw/images/fireeye-2-color-square.png"></p></a><figcaption>FireEye article about the SolarWind breach</figcaption></figure><p><strong>H</strong>owever, a recent tweet from a <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">cybersecurity researcher</a> hints at the fact this compromise probably dates back to 2019, that is more than an year before the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> and US government breach were reported, and the attacker might have been able to own their servers through very simple techniques. Password spraying is a very common technique employed by malicious attackers to compromise systems. In the case of SolarWinds this was even simpler, and weaker credentials may have made the hacker's job just more easier.</p><h2 id="solarwinds-exposed-their-ftp-credentials-in-a-public-github-repository">SolarWinds Exposed their FTP credentials in a public GitHub Repository</h2><p> <strong>Cybersecurity expert, </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/">Vinoth Kumar</a> hinted at the fact that the perpetrator may have breached SolarWinds and its clients quite easily – this affects the US government, and top organizations worldwide. Kumar made the following tweet today,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Was reading about a sophisticated attack on FireEye leveraging Solarwinds. Hmmm how that would happened?🤔. Then realized their password was *****123 🤣 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FireEye?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FireEye</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SolarWinds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SolarWinds</a> <a href="https://t.co/foGzEOdytG">pic.twitter.com/foGzEOdytG</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338431183588188160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>Vinoth Kumar's tweet regarding the exposed FTP credentials of SolarWinds</figcaption></figure><p>For the readers who couldn't fully understand the tweet, Vinoth had apparently gotten access to a SolarWinds FTP server on 19th November, 2019 through FTP credentials leaked in a SolarWinds public <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> repo (apparently a<em> configuration</em> file as can be observed from the above email screenshot) which is more than one year ago. He responsibly reported this security incident to the SolarWinds PSIRT team.</p><p>The above tweet includes a screenshot of Vinoth's email communication with the SolarWinds' security team who seem to have acknowledged the issue, but its unclear whether after the incident SolarWinds hardened their server security.</p><h2 id="nation-state-adversary-or-a-simple-github-leak">Nation-State adversary or, a simple Github Leak?</h2><p>Exposing password in public GitHub repositories is a very common security lapse among organizations but can be prevented quite easily with secure practices. We have identified thousands of credentials belonging to companies and responsibly reported such cases. This happened in the case of SolarWinds too, Vinoth found their FTP server credentials which allowed read as well as write access to SolarWinds' FTP server. This critical vulnerability could have allowed them to upload malicious files and binaries to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, which made the SolarWinds Orion software available to its clients for download.</p><p>Vinoth confirmed that the FTP credentials SolarWinds leaked had write access by uploading a test file to the vulnerable FTP server – <a href="https://downloads.solarwinds.com/">downloads.solarwinds.com</a> which apparently hosts very important files, and if tampered with, the results can be disastrous, which was likely the reason of the US Government breach that happened recently. </p><h2 id="solarwinds-might-have-been-compromised-at-least-an-year-ago-in-november-2019">SolarWinds might have been compromised at least an year ago, in November 2019</h2><p>SolarWinds' PSIRT team's last reply to Vinoth was on 22nd November, 2019 which is 3 days after his report, </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the last response I got from them. <a href="https://t.co/Q24JGb3mvr">pic.twitter.com/Q24JGb3mvr</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338449660327854080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>SolarWinds Security Team's response to Vinoth Kumar acknowledging the vulnerability</figcaption></figure><p>They have informed him that the Github repository exposing the credentials was subsequently taken down by SolarWinds. This may have played an important role in the latest security breach of SolarWinds that led to the US Government breach.</p><h2 id="complex-attack-or-a-case-of-weak-credentials">Complex Attack or, a Case of Weak Credentials?</h2><p>Vinoth further mentions in the tweet that the password was <code>*****123</code>. Our <strong>guess</strong> is that, the password of that FTP server was <code>solarwinds123</code>, leaving the redacted part, which is a very weak credential. <code>solarwinds123</code> is an example of the weakest credentials one can think of. &nbsp;Credentials of the FTP download server which was exposed on the SolarWinds GitHub repo are as follows – <code>solarwindsnet:solarwinds123</code></p><p>It would take seconds for advanced credential stuffing tools to exfiltrate into SolarWinds networks leading to the supply chain of the malware used in this attack, which seems to be the case here. Weak and easy to guess credentials continue to be a very common cause of breaches that happens these days. We have observed a lot of big companies using <code>admin:admin</code> and easy to guess credentials in their internal panels, while we performed pentests and bug hunting research. </p><p>This is an ideal example to learn from, what the consequence of weak credentials can be. Organizations should learn from these breaches how easy it is for attackers to compromise an entire organization just by guessing credentials and performing password stuffing attacks.</p><p><em>Although there is more to it that led to the series of events</em>, but the exposed and weak credentials might have played a major role in the SolarWinds hack. The attackers might have been able to gain persistence by obtaining SolarWinds internal credentials and then able to backdoor the SolarWinds Orion (which FireEye called the SUNBURST backdoor, https://downloads.solarwinds.com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp) by uploading it to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, and distributing the same via SolarWinds website to its clients.</p><h2 id="qa-with-cybersecurity-expert-vinoth-kumar">Q&amp;A with Cybersecurity Expert <a href="https://vinothkumar.me/">Vinoth Kumar</a></h2><p>We asked cybersecurity expert Vinoth about his opinions on this breach, and how organizations can secure themselves from such sophisticated attacks.</p><p><strong>Q: As you mentioned you found some credentials in the open, do you think the attackers went for a similar approach to use simple OSINT techniques in order to exfiltrate the data?</strong></p><p><strong>Vinoth: </strong>I think the attackers must have used the same approach as the FTP server was open &amp; credentials were not strong enough.

                    <p>I'm pretty impressed by what I've seen with Apple's M1 Chip. It's really fast and powerful for essential everyday tasks, which include browsing the web, working with Intel-based apps, and using programming apps. Yes – the ecosystem is moving, and that may take time, but I think M1 is worth paying for it because of its phenomenal performance.</p><p>M1 is fast, and many benchmarks have proved its performance. However, I was curious about the performance of the programming languages using M1. So I decided to test it for the most popular workloads here.</p><p>Before you see the results, you should know that some benchmark suites are memory-intensive, some are CPU-intensive, and some have no benefits with multi-core processing because of its overhead or its difficulty for utilizing. It means that M1 can have an advantage over the desktop-class multi-core Ryzen processor even though the core count is lesser. <strong>Most importantly, I've focused more on real-world development performance testing rather than synthetic, production tests.</strong></p><p>You can check the raw benchmark data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4U7LAImfEcXRihJbySZcRr32tn6WSWAtslfXltds58/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>I add the following comment as of Dec 14: we care how fast our dev computer runs. the multi-core advantage of 3900X is useless for most of the benchmarks here that don't represent the real-world production performance at all but devs usually work on their laptops, desktops, etc most of the time so I think such real-world development performance benchmarks make it worthwhile though. of course, Ryzen 3900X will perform way better than M1 and Intel when it comes to production, mostly achieved by parallelizing.</p><h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2><ul><li>Apple M1: Mac Mini (16GB RAM), MacBook Air (8GB RAM) / macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (All executables used for benchmarks are natively compiled for Apple Silicon.)</li><li>Ryzen 3900X: ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T / 16GB DDR4-3200 x 2 / Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (tested after shutting down background tasks.) – You may wonder why I used 3900X instead of Ryzen 5000-series CPUs: Because I don't have it.

<p>Last week I left my cushy job at Amazon after 8 years. Despite getting rewarded repeatedly with promotions, compensation, recognition, and praise, I wasn’t motivated enough to do another year.</p>



<p>I spent my entire time in AWS building tools for developers. I liked that field so much that I would have been satisfied working in it for the rest of my life.</p>



<p>I joined Amazon as an entry level developer. Within 3.5 years I had been promoted twice to a senior engineer, and I was practically guaranteed another promotion to principal engineer this year if I had stayed. My potential at the company was high, I was told.</p>



<p>My esteem within the company grew along the years and I was regarded an expert and a leader in my field. People looked up to me and respected me.</p>



<p>I made $75K in my first year and that gradually grew to $511K by my last year. I could have made another $1M if I stayed another couple of years.</p>



<p>My work–life balance was good too, despite Amazon’s reputation. I didn’t need to prove myself anymore, and I could get everything done in 40 hours a week. My team worked from home one day a week, and I rarely opened my laptop at night or weekends.</p>



<p>Also, the people I worked with were exceptional. I had three managers in total, and all were generous people with lots of empathy. I’m very grateful to everyone I worked with.</p>



<p>Everything was going well and getting better. But despite all this, my motivation to go to work each morning was decreasing—almost in an inverse trend to my career and income growth.</p>

<p>It would have been foolish of me to expect my motivation to start increasing if I got yet another promotion, or another compensation bump, or another big project. But there was something else that was trending down with my motivation. It was my freedom.</p>



<h3>The Motivation Decline</h3>



<p>For the first couple of years my motivation was off the charts. I was mostly working with another person on an internal tool, and there was very little scrutiny around it. It was a time where I had a lot of independence in choosing how to work and what to work on—at least relative to more recent years.  It was just me and the other person improving this thing, talking to users, releasing updates, testing it, and everything else. Whatever we felt was important, we generally got to do. We did the best work we could for its own sake and we were mostly self-directed.</p>



<p>The last couple of years, however, were quite different. I was leading the most important project in the history of my department, with many stakeholders and complex goals. What I could do was always bounded by my ability to convince all the people involved that it was the best way to navigate our goals. </p>



<p>I was always going to be working on somebody else’s terms at Amazon. The terms were simple in the beginning (keep fixing the thing), but kept getting more complicated as the years passed by (maximize all goals; satisfy all stakeholders). Then there were other restrictions inherent to working in a large organization about how to do the work, what work to do, what goals to set, and what business was worth pursuing. This situation was squeezing me into doing things that I’d rather not do, and vice versa.</p>



<h3 id="mce_19">Finding New Motivation</h3>



<p>What kind of work would I do if I had to do it forever? Not something that I did until I reached some milestone (an exit), but something that I would consider satisfactory if I continued to do it until I’m 80. What is out there that I could do that would make me excited waking up every day for the next 45 years that could also earn me enough money to cover my expenses? Is that too unambitious? I don’t think so. Because there are two types of drivers that get me out of bed in the morning.</p>



<p>One comes from the outside in the form of a carrot or a stick. For instance, I’m not automatically driven to do my tax returns every April, but I make sure I do because I don’t want to go to prison. Or I might not want to work on something I dislike, but I do so anyway because I may need to pay the bills, or want to buy a fancy car. These are the extrinsic motivators.</p>



<p>The other comes from within. This is what drives me to do things when there isn’t a carrot or a stick. Hobbies are one activity driven by this. But what I was looking for was something that I could do for a living that was also driven by this type of motivation: the intrinsic kind.</p>



<p>Back to the question of whether this is too unambitious. See, I realized that extrinsic motivation doesn’t last. Whenever I got promoted, it felt good for a week, and then it was as over. When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.</p>



<p>The things that don’t wear off are those that I’ve been doing since I was a kid, when nothing was forcing me to do them. Things such as writing code, selling my creations, charting my own path, calling it like I saw it. I know my strengths, and I know what motivates me, so why not do this all the time? I’m lucky to live in a time where I can do something independently in my area of expertise without requiring large amounts of capital or outside investors. So that’s what I’m doing.</p>



<h3>What’s Next?</h3>



<p>I’m going all in on independence, and I’m going to try to make a living with my own bare hands starting from nothing. I don’t expect to only do things that I like, but it will be on my terms. My target is to cover my family’s expenses before I run out of savings while doing something that intrinsically motivates me. What more would I ever want to be satisfied with my work?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The overwhelming majority of people do not seem to care about privacy. They ask why they should care if they have “nothing to hide”. Yet this idea of hiding is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>The United Nations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy" rel="nofollow">state</a> that privacy is a human right, just like the right to education is. So why on earth would you give that up? The famous (and somewhat obligatory) quote from Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower:</p>

<blockquote><p>Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question about privacy is not about hiding, it is about sharing. It is not that I have nothing to hide, I just do not have anything I want to share, especially unknowingly.&nbsp;This whole narrative that privacy is only for nefarious people is pushed by those who quite clearly care alot about privacy. Mark Zuckerberg spent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-neighbouring-houses" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of dollars</a> buying the houses that surrounded his home, for example. The irony is painful.</p>

<p>We all care about our privacy, though we might not know it. It is why we lock the door when we go to the toilet; or why we close the curtains to stop people looking into our homes.</p>

<p>In her essay for Aeon Magazine, Carissa Véliz <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-us-all" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that privacy is power. It is the power “to show you ads... and to predict your behaviour”. But it is also the power to influence. Increasingly, Big Tech, the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, are sharing more and more information with governments. In turn, governments are starting to learn more and more about their citizens. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun – and this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy to be normal – and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being judged by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.</p>

<p>The war is not lost, however. We paved the path for Big Tech, though we no longer have to follow it. If we change our actions then a lot can be achieved. In most instances, alternatives to mainstream products, such as Google, are available. <a href="https://privacytools.io/" rel="nofollow">PrivacyTools.io</a> is a website, of which I am a team member, designed to showcase tools and knowledge to protect your privacy, along with housing a wonderful community of like minded privacy advocates. By simply switching to a few of the recommended services and installing some of the recommended add-ons we can slowly reverse the damage that was done. Furthermore, if you live in the EU, you can use your rights under GDPR to ensure all data that companies have on you is erased.</p>

<p>Privacy matters, regardless of who you are. We seriously need to start protecting it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Confusing UI design = Recipe for Disaster</strong> – &nbsp;Setting up 2FA on our PayPal business account was exactly that. Usually most payment providers make 2FA a mandate in the setup process, or, at least asks its users to set it up during sign up itself, but PayPal doesn't. I have no complaints about PayPal's Infosec standards as they have been running a successful bug bounty program on Hackerone and seem to have a very responsive and active security team. </p><h2 id="update">Update</h2><p>We did some more research and found out this problem has been there for more than 2 years now yet no action from PayPal's end – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth">https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth</a></p><p>We haven't received any response from PayPal yet but have gotten in touch with them regarding the same.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-4.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-4.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png 1525w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Users complaining about the issue on PayPal</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2fa-and-account-compromise">2FA and Account Compromise</h2><p>Setting up 2FA is really critical for account security, and PayPal accounts are no different – naturally, they are a more interesting target for hackers due to the price tag attached to them. Thus, enabling 2FA in the first place would be the most logical step to prevent unauthorized account intrusions and account hacks, as every log in would require a TOTP code from an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or, Authy as part of the 2FA process. However, I found this process really hard due to the confusing documentation on PayPal website. </p><p>The process to setup 2FA on PayPal for account security was by far the most difficult, time consuming and confusing process ever but when we get to it... you can realize how simple it could have actually been. Its the most important step to take to prevent getting your PayPal account hacked or, breached or, compromised. In this post, I have explained the full process and why it was so confusing.</p><p>PayPal's confusing UI design can become a threat to user account security &nbsp;as it makes it harder for users to setup 2FA for their accounts.</p><p>But it was, really... I mean <strong>REALLY</strong> difficult for me to locate their 2FA option. I couldn't spot it anywhere in their UI even after several Google searches about this, nothing showed up – whatever did was either too outdated or, totally useless or, deprecated. </p><p>Confused, I got in touch with their Customer Support who pointed me to their the <strong>Settings </strong>page, and told a <strong>Security </strong>page was located there. But... what? I couldn't find one. Weird, that's how difficult PayPal makes it to simply add an additional layer of security to your account. This made me wonder, why is it so difficult to enable a simple security feature like 2FA on PayPal? I tried everything, every button and navigation links on their Android and iOS apps too but failed to locate the 2FA setup page.</p><p>Utterly disappointed, when I came across <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">this</a> Help Center Article which was disguised in the form of a general FAQ about 2FA but, finally I found that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">magic link</a>! – </p><figure><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete"><div><p>what-is-2-step-verification</p><p><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/icon/pp196.png"></p></div></a></figure><p>Well, there's a catch. </p><h2 id="the-catch">The Catch</h2><p>When you are <strong>logged out</strong>, PayPal would show the following 2FA Setup process instructions in their <strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">Documentation/Help Guide</a> – </strong></p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-1.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-1.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png 1637w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-out 2FA Setup Guide</figcaption></figure><p>However, when you are <strong>logged in, </strong>the instructions asked you to go to profile page and setup 2FA from there – <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">this</a> is the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">final link</a> that leads to the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">2FA setup process</a>. This is <strong>how simple it could have been, </strong>but confusing documentation on the help pages and equally misleading instructions given by customer support made the process incredibly hard and confusing!</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-2.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-2.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-2.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png 1715w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-in Profile Page for 2FA Setup</figcaption></figure><h2 id="steps-to-setup-or-add-2fa-to-your-paypal-account-business-account-users-">Steps to setup or, add 2FA to your PayPal account (Business account users)</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Turns out PayPal might have done some UI revamping which effectively resulted in concealing the <strong>Security </strong>page's navigation from Account Settings page.

Every major payment provider allows merchants and business users to setup 2FA right from the mobile – but I couldn't find the option in either of the apps – neither Android nor iOS which is bad from a security and accessibility standpoint.</p><h2 id="my-opinion">My Opinion</h2><p>PayPal itself isn't insecure but these are what I call – classic business logic errors. The UI is the first step towards making a better application and give an overall good experience to the average consumer. Secondly, I had to face a not-so knowledgeable customer support staff who explained how to <strong>navigate to 2FA setup, </strong>but turns out that's not the actual way. I have spent probably tens of thousands of dollars <em>over</em>paying PayPal fees and this is what I get in terms of value for money or, my ROI, a bad user experience (UX). I'm not blaming anyone – but despite charging so much in fees, PayPal still hasn't been able to provide a proper UI/UX to its clients. There are several pain points in their UI, and nothing much has changed in most critical parts of their web app since the past 10-12 years, only some parts of the UI/UX has been revamped but some <strong>areas </strong>like 2FA setup are harder because of PayPal's extremely clunky and confusing UI.</p><p>If app developers don't design the UI properly, they can unintentionally cause losses on the part of their users – as in this case, a legitimate user couldn't setup 2FA on their account due to a buggy UI. I strongly feel UI and UX form a core part of an Application's security and not just the backend and frontend parts involving code. <strong>The UI features should encourage the user to enable more security features in the app, </strong>but in this case – it was misleading and confusing.</p><h2 id="harder-ui-more-security-issues-effectively">Harder UI = More Security Issues, effectively</h2><p>With harder UI in fine grained applications with varying levels of access controls, it becomes increasingly harder for users to manage account restrictions and security policies. As in this example, the <strong>Security </strong>page was hidden from the view which potentially makes a user account more susceptible to compromise. A better and smooth UI ensures a user is able to setup every security setting to optimal level. </p><p>Harder the UI = More the confusion on the part of the user. This can leave organization accounts open to breaches and evidently a lot of hackers are exploiting misconfigurations in application due to user ignorance.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2><p>The entire process was far more painstaking and confusing, than how simple it should have been on the contrary. Thus, making a more intuitive and proper UI is very important from user security point of view than a confusing feature-loaded loosely designed product. Also, security features like 2FA should be mandated in applications dealing with payments and high value transactions in general. Due to a UI revamp or, refactor, that missed putting into place the Security link in Navigation, users can miss the 2FA setup and for those using weak credentials can end up getting hand – which is how hundreds of thousands of PayPal accounts and Credit Card &nbsp;data aka <strong>Fullz </strong>end up getting hacked and sold on darknet marketplaces.</p><blockquote><em><strong>How we can help?</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong><a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a></strong> conducts in-depth security research, bug hunting, and security consultancy.

<p>As far as I can remember, I’ve always had a disdain towards Apple products. Something about buying a laptop with poor thermals, a restrictive operating system, and a $1400 price tag just didn’t sit right with me. I was more content using my beat-up Thinkpad with Linux installed. </p>



<p>But 2020 has been an interesting year. So it would be fitting that 2020 would be the first year that I would venture out to buy a new laptop and somehow settle on choosing the new M1 Macbook Air. After using it for the past few weeks, I could not be happier. However, this got me thinking. How did Apple convince me (a staunch critic of Apple products) to buy a Mac?</p>



<p>After retracing my steps, I realized it was primarily due to their copywriting. As an engineer, I’ve only recently started to realize how important copywriting is when selling anything. Apple’s recent campaign around the new M1 Macs has been nothing short of spectacular and as engineers, I feel like there 2 key takeaways we all can learn from them. </p>



<h2>Talk About Impact And Not Numbers</h2>



<p>Two years ago I had just started my own startup that was highly technical. We were building computer vision algorithms to empower minimally trained medical professionals to do oral disease screenings. Our team was filled with engineers who were always striving to grow our accuracy so we could improve the value of our product. </p>



<p>This mentality carried over to our marketing materials, from our website to our sales deck. We had an accuracy of 85% which was about 15% more effective than the current incumbent, and we let everybody know. The number 85 was plastered over everything and we were proud of it. We even showed people how great our F1 Score was in relation to other medical AI companies. Our marketing was heavy on the numbers which we felt accurately demonstrated our product’s value. </p>



<p>However, it never really resonated with customers. Most doctors we were pitching to didn’t even know what an F1 score was. To see how to do numbers correctly we should look at the following marketing material:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg 1000w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-300x169.jpg 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-768x432.jpg 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-100x56.jpg 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-700x394.jpg 700w" data-sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></figure></div>



<p>Apple showed this graph at a recent event but notice how there are only 2 numbers on the screen. Even the graph has no clearly visible indicators on the y and x-axis (you really have to pay attention to what each axis represents). Instead, it shows the improvement in relation to other chips without blasting the crowd with a series of numbers. Now, this is how Apple communicates this improvement on their website when focusing on potential customers:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png" alt="Battery Copy Example" width="430" height="324" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png 1024w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-300x227.png 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-768x581.png 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1536x1161.png 1536w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-100x76.png 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-595x450.png 595w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1588x1200.png 1588w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1.png 1868w" data-sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"></figure></div>



<p>Now the Apple marketing team could have used this space to go into the specifics about the power draw of this new M1 chip and how it’s better than the old Intel chips. In fact, this move was wildly criticized by technical reviewers. Most notably Linus Tech Tips said that Apple’s unwillingness to release these specific numbers could be their downfall on this new Mac (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljApzn9YWmk">video link</a>). Yet this Mac has had a great reception and great sales. </p>



<p>So why did this marketing move work? Because Apple focused on how this better power consumption was going to solve the deeper emotional problems of their consumers. In one swift sentence, they were able to communicate 3 very key points. </p>



<p>With “Up to 18 hours of battery life. That’s 6 more hours, free of charge”, the Apple marketing team is able to show how this better battery consumption will increase the overall time you (as the consumer) have during a single charge but also clearly draws the competitive advantage by saying that is 6 hours more than their previous models/competitors. Finally, ending with “free of charge” lets us know that we aren’t going to paying more for this increased efficiency. It’s a powerful sentence that clearly conveys a technical topic like the M1 chip’s power consumption into something more digestible to your everyday consumer. </p>



<p>We see this work again in the following:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.50.44-PM-1-686x1024.png" alt="" width="246" height="368" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.50.44-PM-1-686x1024.png 686w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.50.44-PM-1-201x300.png 201w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.50.44-PM-1-768x1146.png 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.50.44-PM-1-67x100.png 67w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.50.44-PM-1-301x450.png 301w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.50.44-PM-1-804x1200.png 804w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.50.44-PM-1.png 946w" data-sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px"></figure></div>



<p>This new Mac has great thermals to the point where there is no fan in the Macbook air. However, even without a fan, there is no tradeoff with performance. Again, the Apple team could have used this time to speak about how hot the Macbook actually gets. They could have pulled an MKBHD and used a temperature gun to compare the temperature under different workloads and put this video on their site. Instead, they recognized the real problem is that most people hate the sound of their laptop’s fan cranking away while they are trying to get work done. So rather than getting into the weeds, Apple decided to step back and focus on what pain point they are solving. </p>



<p>How I’ve decided to apply this was taking a step back and every time I saw that we were using too many numbers, I thought critically about what issue we were solving with that number and replaced it with that. </p>



<p>For example, why did health systems care about our device having 85% accuracy? With higher accuracy, doctors were able to refer their patients with more confidence and improve health outcomes. We quickly changed our copywriting to reflect this sentiment. </p>



<h2>Talk Like A Human</h2>



<p>This is something that took me a long time to get past. After going through university, most of my writing became extremely formal. But the truth is no one speaks like that. However, when writing marketing materials, I feel like most engineers default to writing like they are trying to pass a university final rather than talk to a customer. </p>



<p>When you scroll down Apple’s website, it seems like someone is speaking to you. For example: </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-1024x452.png" alt="ML Copy Examplle

<p>Now this is actually a pretty technical point that Apple is trying to get across. However, they are speaking to us, the consumer, in a super casual tone. They start out with a pretty number centric pitch. However, they quickly pivot to speaking about how this extra speed will help you with your day to day activities. During this part of the pitch, they sound like a normal person. </p>



<p>The light gray paragraph is filled with shortened words (like pro vs. professional) and run-on sentences. They use casual language like “That’s” and casual terminology like “brain power”. If I wrote like this while doing my undergrad ethics class I’m sure I wouldn’t have passed. However, when you see any company writing like this it humanizes them. </p>



<p>This gave me flashbacks to 2 related moments during my freshman year during school. The first moment came when I was walking into my engineering library and saw a desk set up in the entryway. Two students stood in front of it hawking a new app that lets you get discounts on food within Green Street (the most popular street at UIUC). Since they were near the staircase, I had to listen briefly to their spiel before grabbing a brochure and leaving. I never downloaded that app and it soon went under so I’m assuming most people also didn’t download the app. The second moment came my junior year where during a party, a friend of a friend mentioned how he was using this brand new app on campus which let him see food deals. I had built up enough rapport with this stranger where I thought it would be worth checking out this app so I downloaded it that night. I later came to find out that guy was a campus ambassador for that app and it was his job to get students on the app. Even after finding that out, I still kept the app. </p>



<p>So why did I download the app the second time and not the first? Because the first time, I was in a situation where I felt like I was being sold something. Those campus ambassadors had a script and they stuck to it. The second time, I wasn’t actually being sold anything but rather listening to a guy talk about his experience on the app. The difference was very noticeable. In the first case, they were rattling off numbers about how much money I could save while in the second case, the ambassador told me stories about how he got 30 chicken nuggets for 6 dollars or how he was able to get a free meal for his date after finding a buy 1 get 1 free offer at a local burrito joint. </p>



<p>This can be applied to copywriting. The difference between bad and good copywriting is the ability to make it not sound like a sales pitch. If people feel like they are trying to be sold something, they are more likely to put up a wall and not buy anything. As an engineer, I try to write about what I’m working on like I’m telling my friend about it. That way it’s always more personable. Remember, people don’t like being sold to. </p>



<hr>



<p>Apple does a great job of technical copywriting. Their teams are great at taking complex technical advantages and condensing them down into something more understandable. I think we can all learn from them and apply some of their methods to our own side projects. As the saying goes – <em>“Good artists make, great artists steal”</em></p>

      <h2>What's all this, then?</h2>
      <p><strong>BLABRECS</strong> is a rules modification for the wordgame SCRABBLE that swaps out the dictionary of real-if-obscure English words for a capricious artificial intelligence. In BLABRECS, real English words aren't allowed! Instead, you have to play nonsense words that <em>sound</em> like English to the AI. These nonsense words are called – you guessed it – BLABRECS.</p>
      <h2>How do I play?</h2>
      <p>Get together your regular SCRABBLE supplies and pull up this page in a web browser. Then play SCRABBLE as normal, but before you play a word, use the "test a word..." box at the top of the page to check whether the AI will let you play it. Remember, you can only play words that the AI approves!</p>
      <p>When you find a legal word to play, hit the "Play It" button to add this word to the lexicon. As you play, you can write in definitions for all the words you've invented in the "Meaning" textbox next to each word. The player who comes up with the best definition for a word can add half of that word's points to their SCRABBLE score at the end of the game.</p>
      <h2>I found a real word that the AI thinks is playable! What should I do?</h2>
      <p>This happens often with proper nouns (which SCRABBLE generally disallows) and with inflected forms of base words that are disallowed. I think you should play by the spirit of BLABRECS and not the letter, but what this means is ultimately up to you. Is the game primarily about exploring the vast "shadow English" implied by the statistical distribution of letter sequences, or is it about the inherent absurdity of an external authority presuming to dictate your language to you? Either interpretation seems valid to me.</p>
      <h2>How does the AI work?</h2>
      <p>Right now it uses a Markov model trained on the <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/">ENABLE word list</a> used in a number of wordgames. It looks at the statistical patterns of letter sequences in English words and uses this information to determine how likely a sequence of letters is to be a real English word. Then it rejects both real dictionary words and fake words that it deems insufficiently plausible. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mkremins/blabrecs">source code</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
      <p>I might update BLABRECS to provide a wider range of AI "opponents" using a variety of different technologies in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
      <h2>Why is it called BLABRECS?</h2>
      <p>I generated every possible permutation of the word SCRABBLE and asked an early version of the AI to sort them from least to most statistically likely. BRABLECS won out by a significant margin, beating not only the real word SCRABBLE but also my hand-designed previous title BESCRALB. Then I switched the L and the R because BLABRECS sounds better and I'm not about to let a computer tell me what to do.</p>
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
      <p>I'm <a href="https://mkremins.github.io/">Max Kreminski</a>, an artifical intelligence researcher and game designer. At the time of this release (December 2020), I'm working on my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I make a lot of weird stuff with AI; if you want to keep tabs on my work, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">follow me on Twitter</a>.

<p>I wasn’t really paying attention, so maybe I’m the only one that hadn’t noticed, but Tesla’s market cap as of December 9th 2020 is a touch over 616 billion US dollars. That makes it kind of a big deal. In fact, it accounts for a full third of the global automaker market cap:</p>







<p>Just for a bit of context – Tesla only listed on the stock market 10 years ago (June 2010). The company itself was only founded in 2003. Compare that to Ford which launched in 1903 and basically invented the concept of mass production (the Model T is still one of the best selling cars of all time) or Benz in 1889, whose founder, Karl Benz, literally had a patent on the original goddamn automobile. </p>



<p>Here’s a racing bar chart of a few of the top automakers share prices over the last couple of decades. Tesla both literally and figuratively comes out of nowhere (spoiler alert: things get insane in 2019):</p>







<p>As you can see from the chart, the share price has pretty much 10x’d over the last 12 months. Why? Well, it’s certainly not because Tesla is making 10 times the revenue or shipping 10 times as many cars. In all of 2019, for example, Tesla shipped 367,500 cars. In Q3, 2020, they shipped 139,300 cars, giving them a run rate of around 550,000 cars for the entire year. For context, <strong>Toyota sold 927,623 cars in October 2020 alone</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/profile/production-sales-figures/" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>



<p>Here’s how Tesla compares to some of the automakers mentioned above in terms of yearly car sales:</p>







<p>No, I didn’t forget to add Tesla to the chart – you just can’t see the label because of how tiny the sales numbers are relative to other automakers (it’s that little blue sliver between Volkswagen and BMW if you still haven’t found it).</p>



<p>As you’d expect from the huge disparity in car sales shown above, Tesla’s revenues are also dwarfed by the bigger incumbents. Expected 2020 revenues are around 28 billion USD – impressive, but more than an order of magnitude less than VW’s 299 billion USD in 2019. </p>







<p>So why does the market have such a hard on for Tesla? As the chart above shows, Tesla’s market cap seems to be completely out of whack with its revenues and earnings (the latter was just 10 million USD in 2019). </p>



<p>The simple answer is that the market is valuing the VW’s, Toyota’s, and Daimler’s of the world on what they are – car companies. Tesla, on the other hand, is being valued as a tech business, and therefore what it *could* be. Car companies are boring and predictable. Technology companies though… Well, they have pretty much unlimited upside, don’t they?</p>



<p>Here are a few things Tesla has going for it.</p>



<ul><li>First, and most obviously, the electric car market is really just getting started. There are close to 100 million new cars per year sold globally, and less than 1% of them are electric, though this number is growing quickly – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-electric-idUSKBN27C08C">it’s already 5% in China</a> – and expected to surpass 50% in most developed nations by 2030. There is even some talk of the UK and EU <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/build-back-greener-boris-johnson-bans-petrol-cars-by-2030-20201119-p56fwn.html" target="_blank">banning sales</a> of new petrol and diesel cars in the not too distant future.<p>Tesla clearly has a first mover advantage here, and a lead on battery technology and EV engineering, though the quantum of this lead is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-technology-electric-vehicles-engineering-51592842119" target="_blank">disputed</a>. </p></li><li>Tesla may be the first company to actually nail self-driving. After overpromising and underdelivering for years (in 2015, Musk predicted FSD could arrive by 2018), Tesla Full Self Driving appears to have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" target="_blank">launched in beta</a> for some drivers, though early reports of its reliability are mixed.<br></li><li>Revenue growth to date. Sure, as we can see in the above chart, total revenues are still only a fraction of VW’s and Toyota’s, but 10 years ago Tesla had revenues of 100m USD compared to 2020’s projected 28B USD – that’s a roughly 28 fold increase. In the same period, VW’s revenue has increased by about 75%, and Toyota’s by only around 30%.<br></li><li>Well placed in solar and home energy storage. <br></li><li>The Tesla brand is cool, the Elon Musk brand is cool </li></ul>



<p>And finally, Tesla is, for pretty much the first time in its history doing something many of its critics said it would never do – <strong>actually turning a profit</strong>. The 10 million USD profit it made in 2019 was for all intents and purposes breaking even (and was driven largely by sale of regulatory credits), but in 2020 expected profits are a meaty looking 1.26B USD.</p>
