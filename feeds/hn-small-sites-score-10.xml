<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><main><article role="article"><div><p>In a previous life, I was an electronic music designer working on Broadway shows in New York City. Broadway shows look glamorous and expensive on the outside, but it’s often quite the opposite on the inside –&nbsp;at least for the music department. One of the toughest parts of my job as an electronic music designer was to find the best performance-to-cost ratio for computer rigs powering keyboards, guitars, playback tracks, and more.</p><p>Over the past decade, Broadway has replaced large sections of traditional orchestras with synthesizers, playback systems, and electronic drum pads. I’m not in support of that, but that’s a story for another day. The point here is that Broadway’s reliance on computer-driven rigs has increased, while the typical budget required to build high-end stable rigs hasn’t increased at the same rate.</p><p>Some shows I’ve worked at set aside a $10,000-$12,000 budget for two keyboard rigs. That sounds like a lot of money at first, but it’s not. For live shows, it’s usually best to have a 1:1 backup in case the main rig fails. That fact alone means you have to design a rig that fits within 50% of the proposed budget. Furthermore, a high-quality keyboard controller alone is $1,500-2,000 –&nbsp;so that means there’s $3,000 left for a computer and everything else.</p><p>Due to budget constraints, many shows end up using Mac minis. Historically speaking, the Mac mini’s computing power has been a bottleneck for electronic music designers on Broadway. In a perfect world, we’d all like to use the best-sounding sample libraries for our work, but that was never feasible with the Mac mini. Thus, the compromise was always to reduce sound quality to fit within the Mac mini’s compute constraints.</p><p>Apple Silicon changes everything for Broadway electronic music designers. The new M1 Mac mini is capable of running high-end sample libraries and virtual instruments in a stable manner, and it’s only going to get better with M2, M3, and M4-series chips in the future. The performance per dollar characteristics of Apple Silicon machines are going to have a huge impact on Broadway’s sound, and I’m very excited to see, or hear, what happens.</p></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

      Got some hilarious reactions. Gotta share.
    </p><div>

<p>Well, <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support">my last post hit it big</a>. Poor blog had a couple social media death hugs on that day. Gosh, people were fuming about me (supposedly) stating that I would not accept their hand-laced, gold-edged, rose scented bug reports without prior payment. How dare I?! Well, I simply do. </p><figure>

<p>The statement was actually that I ignore support requests from non-customers, <strong>especially</strong> when they come <u>disguised</u> as bugreports in order to avoid my fee. I don’t deliberately delete bug reports from my inbox, I simply risk loosing genuine ones because they are drowned out.</p>

<p>But hey, social media. Fast paced universe. Gotta comment while it’s hot, no time to (properly) read the original article. Some people hold some hilarious opinions, though!</p>

<h2 id="what-people-wrote">What people wrote</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Bugs must be fixed!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they don’t. Have you read the license agreement? Search for the phrase “AS IS”. Every <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved license</a> contains it (usually in caps). It means, I am under no obligation to provide any further work and you are not entitled to it.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s a simple way to make me owe you a service (and I’m even offering it): put money in my bank account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bug was your fault in the first place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Oh wait. Is this going to be one of those conspiracy theories where I deliberately put bugs into my code in order to make you pay for removing them? Nice idea, but…</p>

<ul>
<li>That plan does not scale. There are only so many bugs I could plant.</li>
<li>Fixing bugs is the most time consuming form of support. I’m making a loss on that (in particular when considering the time required to design a good bug that some<u>one</u> might pay for getting removed).</li>
<li>I gave you the source, that takes the leverage out of my hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice to use my software was yours. The disclaimer that it might not work is in the license agreement. I did not put myself in the position of being your only option to solve the issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My bug reports are a work of art, you prick! I spent MY TIME on helping YOU to improve YOUR software!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your bug doesn’t bother me. If it did, I’d have fixed it myself. When submitting a bug report, you are not working for me, you are working for yourself and the user community. The same way I was, when making the original software available free of charge (whether or not you want to do it is entirely your choice, I’m not asking you to). Does your bug report include a patch? If yes, then the problem’s solved for you, if not, then you are expecting me to come up with a fix. That’s a work order, here’s my bill.</p>

<p>Why? If I look at the mail, I’ll be tempted to act on it, giving someone a free ride. That’s unfair to those who paid for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I’ll have to pay and get no guarantee that my bug will be fixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but you are guaranteed, that I will be listening to you and give you a definitive answer in a timely manner. That’s something you don’t get from public bugtrackers. See the problem here? You base your risk assessment on your experience with developers you don’t pay and who therefore have no incentive to help you. When I take your money, you are a customer.</p>

<p>I don’t care.</p>

<ul>
<li>If some other developer wants to self exploit and thinks his time is only worth cheers, that’s their choice.</li>
<li>If the project(s) you are talking about are mission critical (and are otherwise funded), then yes, running a community support forum is a sensible choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the reason, I don’t tend to jump off bridges, just because someone else does it.</p>

<p>Part of letting you use my solution is letting you know what problem I solve (by the way, that’s a service, saving you from reading the code in order to figure out what it does - you’re welcome). The conclusion that we both have the same problem was yours to draw. And yes, my software has long since grown beyond my own needs. But guess what, that still doesn’t compel me to work for you for free.</p>

<p>You made yourself the sole address for support. At least provide a community support forum!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outsource self-exploitation while eating up the infrastructure cost? Sounds like a plan. <strong>NOT!</strong> Get your ass out of your echo chamber. The idea of community support is one of the big criticisms <strong>against</strong> open source. When people have a problem, they want someone to talk to and they want their problem fixed in a timely manner. They don’t want to sign up for forum accounts and they don’t want to monitor them for weeks in the hopes that some community member might eventually come up with an answer.</p>

<p>When it comes to my software, I’m the most competent person to talk to. So whether I like to or not, people will (try to) contact me. As a developer, that puts a choice on your table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop your spare time being eaten up with tech support by pulling the software.</li>
<li>Start accepting payment and realize that you are now running a business that creates additional overhead cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I made myself the sole address for support. That is the only logical conclusion. If I’m running a business, why should I let it be cannibalized by running a public support forum / bug tracker? That’s just adding infrastructure cost to choke profit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should have a donation button instead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great idea! How often do you click those?</p>

<p>Seriously, I’m not a registered charity and only those may accept donations. For everyone else it’s just mislabelled, but still taxable income. The moment you put up a “donation” button, you are running a business, which automatically generates overhead costs. Getting five bucks once every blue moon with the implication of having to kiss the generous donor’s feet is simply not sustainable.</p>

<p>I’m not running a charity and I don’t want your “support”. I want, same as you, being paid for the work I do. I find it utterly dishonest to put my work under an open source license, then spend a ridiculous amount of extra work on guilt tripping my users in order to collect alms.</p>

<p>If the license says, “the software is free to use”, then that’s the deal. You get exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is extra and billable.</p>

December 24, 2020 | https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what <a href="https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/">Arjun Guha</a> and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>

              <section>
              <p>Anonymous posts on Gurlic are quite straight-forward. There is an actual user with the username <code>anonymous</code>. Whenever a new anonymous post is created, the database query looks like this:</p><pre><code>INSERT into posts(content, user_id) 
VALUES($1, (SELECT id from users where username='anonymous'))</code></pre><p>Initially, I wanted a way for users to be able to edit their anonymous posts. That is a little tricky though, because there has to be some record that ties the user to the post itself - which defeats the purpose of anonymous posts. In the case of a database leak, that connection is out in the public. We don't want that.</p><p>So anonymous posts are pretty much a one-off action because once they're created, the user no longer has any control over them - whether it's editing the post, marking it as NSFW, deleting it and so on. </p><p>This also means that the <code>anonymous</code> user has a <a href="https://gurlic.com/anonymous" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">profile</a>, just like any other user, and can be followed, mentioned etc.</p><p>I'm sure someone has a much better way to implement anonymous posts that are tied to the users that created them, while being secure at the same time. It does seem like a lot of extra work though. </p><p>Why be not lazy when you can be lazy?</p>

          the late 1980s I was making paintings about computer games. In January 1991 I bought an Amiga computer and made a series of fictional

          this means of presentation was also appropriate in that it made it seem

<h2>Roughly 500 employees failed the test, which claimed they would receive a $650 bonus.</h2>



<p>“2020 has been a record year for GoDaddy, thanks to you!” the email read.</p>



<p>Sent by Happyholiday@Godaddy.com, tucked underneath a glittering banner of a snowflake and stamped with the words “GoDaddy Holiday Party,” the Dec. 14 email to hundreds of GoDaddy employees promised some welcome financial relief during an <a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/tens-of-millions-of-americans-face-economic-ruin-unless-congress-gets-its-sht-together/">otherwise stressful year</a>.</p>



<p>“Though we cannot celebrate together during our annual Holiday Party, we want to show our appreciation and share a $650 one-time Holiday bonus!” the email read. “To ensure that you receive your one-time bonus in time for the Holidays, please select your location and fill in the details by Friday, December 18th.”</p>



<p>But, two days later, the company sent another email.</p>



<p>“You’re getting this email because you failed our recent phishing test,” the company’s chief security officer Demetrius Comes<strong> </strong>wrote. “You will need to retake the Security Awareness Social Engineering training.”</p>

	</figure>



<p>Phishing tests are sent by companies to gauge their employees’ susceptibility to phishing attacks, where people outside the company will attempt to disguise themselves as trusted sources to gain access to sensitive information, like usernames and passwords.</p>



<p>The follow-up email from Comes said that roughly 500 GoDaddy employees clicked on the holiday bonus email and “failed the test.”</p>



<p>Scottsdale-based GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar and web-hosting company, did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the emails. The emails were forwarded to The Copper Courier by three GoDaddy employees.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/05/05/godaddy-confirms-data-breach-what-19-million-customers-need-to-know/?sh=235bf0a91daa">Forbes reported</a> that 28,000 GoDaddy customers were impacted after a data breach compromised their account usernames and passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the company <a href="https://investors.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/press-release-details/2020/GoDaddy-Reports-Second-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx">surpassing 20 million customers this year</a> and reporting “record customer growth,” the company <a href="https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/press-release-details/2020/GoDaddy-Blog-Update/default.aspx">laid off or reassigned</a> hundreds of employees during the coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/business/godaddy-to-lay-off-hundreds-close-texas-offices">including in Arizona</a>, Iowa, and Texas.</p>



<p>GoDaddy is not the first company this year to trick employees into falling for phishing scams by dangling the carrot of a potential bonus.</p>



<p>In September, Tribune Publishing, which owns <a href="https://www.tribpub.com/#">several major newspapers</a> around the country, sent a similar email to its employees.</p>



<p>The email, circulated by <a href="https://twitter.com/justin_fenton/status/1308851669397053440">several furious Tribune employees on Twitter</a>, said the company was giving out targeted bonuses of $5,000-$10,000, only to later reveal itself as a phishing test sent by the company.</p>



<figure><div>
<figure><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I've been able to confirm that this was in fact! an internal test from <a href="https://twitter.com/tribpub?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tribpub</a>. If you click the links, you get a message from the company's training contractor saying you clicked on a simulated phishing test.</p><p>The level of cruelty is actually stunning, even for this company.</p></div>— Danielle Ohl (@DTOhl) <a href="https://twitter.com/DTOhl/status/1308850196978298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote></figure>
</div></figure>



<p>“The level of cruelty is actually stunning,” Tribune reporter Danielle Ohl <a href="https://twitter.com/DTOhl/status/1308850196978298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1308850196978298880%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fy3z8g5%2Ftribune-publishing-out-evils-itself-with-phishing-email-promising-bonuses">wrote at the time</a>.</p>



<p>A Tribune spokesperson <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3z8g5/tribune-publishing-out-evils-itself-with-phishing-email-promising-bonuses">later told Vice News</a> that the exercise was part of a regular, internal test to assess phishing risks and said that it had no intention of offending its employees. “In retrospect, the topic of the email was misleading and insensitive, and the company apologizes for its use,” the statement read.</p>

<p><img src="https://makeartwithpython.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mcyds.png" alt="McDonalds!"></p>

<p>There is no shortage of questionable products to connect you and your home to the internet.</p>

<p>Each brings another sketchy WiFi device connected to your network, and another set of microphones, each listening in your home for their special trigger word.</p>

<p>Rather than invite more digital strangers into our home, it feels more appropriate to keep a personal garden of digital things we’ve made.</p>

<p>In today’s post, we’ll build a tiny web application (and iPhone / Android app!) to control Christmas lights that only works when you’re home, and connected to your home network.</p>



<p><img src="https://kpkaiser.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/react-native-christmas1.png" alt="React Native Christmas Lights"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/3hezYGq">Jetson Nano</a> is my favorite platforms for building localized internet of things projects.</p>

<p>It’s an ARM64 device, with four built in USB ports, and was designed to do machine learning at the edge.</p>

<p>We’ll use it as a server for a <a href="https://amzn.to/3pmSe3c">Z-Wave USB Stick</a>. Z-Wave is a protocol that exists to do home automation. Importantly for us, it operates separately from your WiFi.</p>

<p>In my case, I’ve hooked it up to 2 <a href="https://amzn.to/3hgyxHt">outdoor light switches</a>, to turn on and off my Christmas lights.</p>

<p>The light switches come in a waterproof shielding, with a single manual button on them. You can press the button to enable pair mode, and also to manually turn the lights on and off.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the React Native app running on my iPhone.</p>

<p>Normally, I wouldn’t attempt to build an iPhone app for such a small project.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> has made running code on your phone a great experience. They automatically build and push to your phone via an app and the command line.</p>

<h2 id="building-an-api-for-your-christmas-lights">Building an API for Your Christmas Lights</h2>

<p>The first thing we’ll want to do is check to make sure we’ve got the Z-Wave stick installed and running on our USB drive in the Jetson Nano.</p>

<p>Every time I work with Z-Wave, I forget details of how the Z-Wave network model works. Because of this, I like to open up an IPython session, and start playing around with the network:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>openzwave</span>
<span>from</span> <span>openzwave.option</span> <span>import</span> <span>ZWaveOption</span>
<span>from</span> <span>openzwave.network</span> <span>import</span> <span>ZWaveNetwork</span>

<span># make sure these Z-wave commands get flushed with a time.sleep</span>
<span># also, /dev/ttyACM0 is the name of my USB port for the Z-Stick</span>

<span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>ZWaveOption</span><span>(</span><span>'/dev/ttyACM0'</span><span>)</span>
<span>options</span><span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>()</span>

<span>network</span> <span>=</span> <span>ZWaveNetwork</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span>

<span># the next two lines start an IPython session in line</span>
<span>import</span> <span>IPython</span>
<span>IPython</span><span>.</span><span>embed</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From here, I start to remember how things work, and see that <code>list(network.nodes.keys())</code> gives me a list of the <code>nodes</code> connected to the Z-Wave network. Because I’m in IPython, I can also tab through each object to see the functions available.</p>

<p>But how do you know what capabilities each Z-Wave node has?</p>

<p>Some Z-Wave devices have multiple switches built into them, each potentially with their own dimmer. To grab switches, we need to do a <code>list(network.nodes[node].get_switches.keys())</code>.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, we can then set state on each node with a <code>set_switch</code> function call:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>node_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
<span>for</span> <span>node</span> <span>in</span> <span>node_list</span><span>:</span>
    <span>switches</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>get_switches</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>switches</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>change</span><span>[</span><span>'state'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'ON'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>True</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>

<p>I’ve added a <code>time.sleep</code>, because it can take a bit for the Z-Wave network to propagate state. Two seconds is probably too long to sleep for, but hey, it works, and I’m not in a hurry.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-react-native-app-with-expo">Building a React Native App with Expo</h2>

<p>Again, building an app is usually too much work for such a small project. But it had been a while since I’d built an app, and I kept hearing about React Native, so I decided to give it a go.</p>

<p>I was surprised to be able to have a built version of my app on my phone in under an hour. There’s a new platform called Expo, which handles all of the heavy lifting usually associated with deploying an iPhone app.</p>

<p>Indeed, because my “app” was so small (literally a single button and a single state of <code>ON</code> or <code>OFF</code>), I really didn’t have much to do beyond the basic, example app:</p>

<p>Here, you can see the call to my Flask app’s API, on my local area network. I’ve set a static IP address for my Jetson Nano, and am running a Flask server on a non-standard port, <code>8050</code>. I did this because I have other Flask apps running on my Nano.</p>

<p>When the app is opened, a <code>GET</code> request is made to the <code>/state</code> resource. It returns a JSON object, with the current state of the Z-Wave switches. If one is on, the network is considered <code>ON</code>.</p>

<p>From here, we can press a single button, to flip the state. This makes a <code>POST</code> request to the <code>/state</code> resource, with the desired new state.</p>

<p>I can build the app from my terminal to the Expo App on my phone via an <code>expo build:ios</code>. Once that’s done, I can open up the Expo app and control my Christmas lights.</p>

<p>Mission Accomplished!</p>

<h2 id="alright-im-sold-wheres-the-code">Alright I’m sold, where’s the code?</h2>

<p><img src="https://makeartwithpython.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/christmas-lights.gif" alt="Pressing the button"></p>

<p>All of the code is open source, and lives on <a href="https://github.com/burningion/minimum-viable-christmas-lights">Github</a>. I didn’t mention it, but there’s also a view in the Flask app you can visit in the browser to control the lights too. You can see it at the <code>/</code> url.</p>

<p>I encourage you to make your app look better than mine, and share the results.</p>

<p>Happy holidays!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>In CPython, types implemented in C actually are part of the type tree</h2>

	<p><small>December 24, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In Python, in theory all types descend from <code>object</code> (they are
direct or indirect subclasses of it). For years, I've believed (and
written) that this was not the case at the implementation level for
types written in native C code in CPython (the standard implementation
of Python and the one you're probably using). Types written in C
might behave as if they descended from <code>object</code>, but I thought their
behavior was actually entirely stand-alone, implemented by each
type separately in C. Courtesy of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">Python behind the scenes #6:
how Python object system works</a>,
I've discovered that I'm wrong.</p>

<p>In CPython, C level Python types are not literally subclasses of
the C level version of <code>object</code>, because of course C doesn't have
classes and subclasses in that sense. Instead, you usually describe
your type by defining a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html"><code>PyTypeObject</code></a> struct for it, with
all sorts of fields that you fill in or don't fill in as you need
them, including a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_base"><code>tp_base</code></a> field
for your base type (if you want more than one base type, you need
to take the alternate path of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#heap-types">heap type</a>). When
CPython needs to execute special methods or other operations on
your type, it will directly use fields on your <code>PyTypeObject</code>
structure (and as far as I know, it only uses those fields, with
no fallbacks). On the surface, this looks like the <code>tp_base</code> field
is essentially decorative and is only used to report your claimed
<code>__base__</code> if people ask.</p>

<p>However, there is a bit of CPython magic hiding behind the scenes.
In order to actually use a <code>PyTypeObject</code> as a type, you must
register it and make it ready by calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_Ready"><code>PyType_Ready</code></a>. As part
of this, <code>PyType_Ready</code> will use your type's <code>tp_base</code> to fill
in various fields of your <code>PyTypeObject</code> if you didn't already do
that, which effectively means that your C level type will inherit
those fields from its base type (and so on all the way up to
<code>object</code>). This is outlined in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#cols">a section of the C API</a>, but of course
I never read the C API myself because I never needed to use it.
The <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">how [the] Python object system works</a>
article has more details on how this works, if you're curious, along
with details on how special methods also work (which is more
interesting than I had any idea, and I've looked at this area
before).</p>

<p>(The distinction between what is considered a 'type' and what is
considered a 'class' by <code>repr()</code> is somewhat arbitrary; see the
sidebar <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ClassesAndTypes">here</a>. C level things defined with
<code>PyTypeObject</code> will probably always be considered types instead of
classes.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>A perceptual color space is desirable when doing many kinds of image processing. It is useful for things like:</p><ul><li>Turning an image grayscale, while keeping the perceived lightness the same</li><li>Increasing the saturation of colors, while maintaining perceived hue and lightness</li><li>Creating smooth and uniform looking transitions between colors</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, as far as I am aware, while there are color spaces that aim to be perceptually uniform, none are without significant drawbacks when used for image processing.</p><p>For this reason I have designed a new perceptual color space, designed to be simple to use, while doing a good job at predicting perceived lightness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness">chroma</a> and hue.

If you need a simple perceptual color space, try it out.</p><p>The rest of the post will go into why a new color space was needed, how it has been constructed and how it compares with existing color spaces.</p><hr><p>What properties does a perceptual color space need to satisfy to be useful for image processing? The answer to this is always going to be a bit subjective, but based on my experience, these are a good set of requirements:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Should be an opponent color space</strong>, similar to for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a>.</li><li><strong>Should predict lightness, chroma and hue well</strong>. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> should be perceived as orthogonal, so one can be altered without affecting the other two. This is useful for things like turning an image black and white and increasing colorfulness without introducing hue shifts etc.</li><li><strong>Blending two colors should result in even transitions</strong>. The transition colors should appear to be in between the blended colors (e.g. passing through a warmer color than either original color is not good).</li><li><strong>Should assume a D65 whitepoint</strong>. This is what common color spaces like sRGB, rec2020 and Display P3 uses.</li><li><strong>Should behave well numerically</strong>. The model should be easy to compute, numerically stable and differentiable.</li><li><strong>Should assume normal well lit viewing conditions</strong>. The complexity of supporting different viewing conditions is not practical in most applications. Other models could be used in conjunction if this is needed in some case.</li><li><strong>If the scale/exposure of colors are changed, the perceptual coordinates should just be scaled by a factor</strong>. More complex models that depend on absolute luminance should be avoided since the viewing conditions can not be accurately controlled and incorrect behavior would be confusing.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="what-about-existing-models%3F">What about existing models? <a href="#what-about-existing-models%3F"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h3><p>Let’s look at existing models and how they stack up against these requirements. Further down there are graphs that illustrate some of these issues.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV">CIELUV</a></strong> – Largest issue is their inability to predict hue. In particular blue hues are predicted badly. Other smaller issues exist as well</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM02-UCS</a> and the newer CAM16-UCS</strong> – Does a good job at being perceptually uniform overall, but doesn’t meet other requirements: Bad numerical behavior, it is not scale invariant and blending does not behave well because of its compression of chroma. Hue uniformity is decent, but other models predict it more accurately.</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSA-UCS">OSA-UCS</a></strong> – Overall does a good job. The transformation to OSA-UCS lacks an analytical inverse unfortunately which makes it impractical.</li><li><strong><a href="https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/2858/">IPT</a></strong> – Does a great job modelling hue uniformity. Doesn’t predict lightness and chroma well unfortunately, but meets all other requirements. Is simple computationally and does not depend on the scale/exposure.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-25-13-15131&amp;id=368272">JzAzBz</a></strong> – Overall does a fairly good job. Designed to have uniform scaling of lightness for HDR data. While useful in some cases this introduces a dependence on the scale/exposure that makes it hard to use in general cases.</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSV</a> representation of sRGB</strong> – Only on this list because it is widely used. Does not meet any of the requirements except having a D65 whitepoint.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So, all in all, all these existing models have drawbacks.</p><p>Out of all of these, two models stand out: CAM16-UCS, for being the model with best properties of perceptual uniformity overall, and IPT for having a simple computational structure that meets all the requirements besides predicting lightness and chroma well.</p><p>For this reason it is reasonable to try to make a new color space, with the same computational structure as IPT, but that performs closer to CAM16-UCS in terms of predicting lightness and chroma. This exploration resulted in Oklab.</p><h3 id="how-oklab-was-derived">How Oklab was derived <a href="#how-oklab-was-derived"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h3><p>To derive Oklab, three datasets were used:</p><ul><li>A generated data set of pairs of colors with the same lightness but random hue and chroma, generated using CAM16 and normal viewing conditions.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Our teams are working to coordinate the many individuals and organizations that have offered to help advance The Rocky Linux Foundation, Inc. (Rocky Linux). The core team is working to lay the infrastructure that will support the legal entity and the engineering efforts required to deliver and support an initial release. Updates regarding project news, release dates, and more will be announced on our <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a>, <a href="https://rockylinux.org/">website</a>, and <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/all-rocky-linux-links/833">other social media platforms</a>.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Transparency with the community and for those that will be relying on Rocky Linux to supplant their CentOS 8 installations before support expiration is paramount. We will soon be communicating a timeline for the delivery of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build systems and infrastructure readiness</li>
<li>Automatic package build infrastructures</li>
<li>When the testing package repository will be made public</li>
<li>Installer testing readiness</li>
<li>ETA for length of time needed for community testing</li>
<li>Release candidate availability</li>
</ul>
<p>We are targeting Q2 2021 to deliver our first release of Rocky Linux, made available not only in standard commercial regions, but also <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us">GovCloud</a>, and China.</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the past three weeks, here is some of the progress we’ve made:</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have selected and vetted auditing, logging, and user account management tooling.</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS):
<ul>
<li>The team selected AWS as the primary build platform for development of Rocky Linux. AWS was chosen primarily to protect the integrity of the software supply chain for Rocky Linux.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, donated hardware and rack space isn’t sufficient to meet our supply chain integrity needs.</li>
<li>Traditional physical hardware separate from our production build environment will still be necessary, and we expect a large portion of our infrastructure will exist outside of AWS for the purposes of business continuity, cost, and platform agnosticity.</li>
<li>We have outlined an infrastructure to best secure and facilitate our engineering efforts using multiple VPCs, subnets, and regions for high availability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Centers:
<ul>
<li>We are negotiating with several data center providers for the secure hosting of our physical infrastructure.</li>
<li>After we have our physical infrastructure provider solidified, we will reach back out to those that have offered to donate hardware .</li>
<li>Discussions with the Oregon State University Open Source Lab (<a href="https://osuosl.org/">OSUOSL</a>) regarding resources are in the works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The core tenets of the Infrastructure Team are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide a platform for the automatic and secure builds of packages and components which will allow for community participation without sacrificing security or trust in the resulting packages</li>
<li>The integrity of the build pipeline and software supply chain are paramount.</li>
<li>Be as vendor and platform agnostic as possible. Avoid vendor lock-in.</li>
<li>Be transparent with the community, to the extent possible and practical.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release Engineering and Packaging</h2>
<ul>
<li>The build process for Rocky Linux will use <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji">Koji</a> and <a href="https://pagure.io/fm-orchestrator/tree/master">MBS</a>.</li>
<li>We are developing scripts and build tools to create a pipeline that allows pulling sources, debranding, and building through Koji and <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki">Mock</a>.</li>
<li>The progress of proof of concepts and processes utilized by the Rocky Linux build process, including all errors and dependencies, is being documented in the <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/Development">wiki</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Security team has drafted a Data Classification Policy, which will be made available for public comment pending review.</li>
<li>Groups, members, and permissions structures for the build infrastructure have been laid out for review and evaluation.</li>
<li>In parallel with the infrastructure team, we have architected and designed AWS network and security topologies aligned with best practices and security standards.</li>
<li>Work has started on OpenSCAP documents for popular STIGs.</li>
<li>Plans are being made with the goal of Rocky Linux becoming FIPS compliant.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>In only 12 days, our <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a> have received nearly 150K page views.</li>
<li>Bandwidth to GitHub resources has exceeded the current plan, requiring an upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have chosen <a href="https://rbcreative.team/">Red Barn Creative Team</a> (<em>formerly Hackerthreads</em> ) as the designated / authorized vendor to sell Rocky Linux branded merchandise. We are awaiting proofs from their designers to present to the community, and will as well be accepting submissions for designs.</li>
<li>Over 370 people have responded to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEXnqD1sNHz9cslkMNOk6krUtDdSCYbxL68TTsn7uGZnoSFQ/viewform">form for registering volunteers</a> and supporters.</li>
<li>A blog and mailing list for future announcements and community updates is in development.</li>
<li>We have outgrown Slack due to the size of the community and required feature sets, and will therefore be migrating to <a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a>. This open source platform has a number of features we’ll be taking advantage of, including: an IRC bridge, multi-factor authentication, advanced logging / auditing / security capabilities, and fidelity in channel and access permissions.</li>
<li>Social media following:
<ul>
<li>4.3K active members on Slack</li>
<li>169 followers on <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/rockylinux">LinkedIn</a> with 1.3K post impressions</li>
<li>4K followers on <a href="https://twitter.com/rocky_linux">Twitter</a> with an average of 22K impressions and 3575 interactions per tweet</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Special Interest Groups (SIG)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have received a number of requests for SIGs on a variety of different topics:
<ul>
<li>Desktop / Laptop</li>
<li>Enhanced Security</li>
<li>Kubernetes / Cloud Native</li>
<li>Minimal Install / OS Bootstrap</li>
<li>Storage appliance</li>
<li>HPC and next generation HPC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The evolution of a SIG should result in optional package repositories and/or custom installers.</li>
<li>We will need leaders for SIGs as well as proposals.</li>
<li>Timelines for these proposals will be coming soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Rocky Linux is first and foremost a freely available Enterprise Linux clone. SIGs will optionally enhance that base and provide extra packages and capabilities to that stable base. At no point will a SIG affect the default core of Rocky Linux.</em></p>
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have a number of companies who have stepped up to sponsor the Rocky Linux Foundation in the form of developers, hardware, cloud instances, and money.</li>
<li>Sponsorship will have different levels, and we are happy to speak with organizations interested in helping.</li>
<li>All contributors will be publicly thanked on our website.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Rocky Linux Foundation, Inc. has been registered as a legal not-for-profit entity in the United States (Delaware).</li>
<li>An application for 501(​c)(3) non-profit status will be submitted as we mature and can afford the legal representation to do so.</li>
<li>We are considering licensing for our data that will enable the greatest flexibility for our community. At present, the team is leaning towards the 3 Clause BSD license, but community input is welcome on this decision.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Localization</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/c/localization/10">localization category</a> has been created on our forums, with many people interested in helping with translations to a number of languages including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, Afrikaans, Greek, Turkish, and many more.</li>
<li>We will be working to ensure future newsletters are translated to as many languages as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an interest in assisting with translations, please reach out via the <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/c/localization/10">localization category of our forums</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lastly, this wouldn’t at all be possible without <em>you</em>. We’re immensely grateful for the community’s enthusiasm, excitement, and help. Rocky Linux is, and will  remain a community-driven effort.</p>

          <p>Thanks for the update <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/u/jorp">@jorp</a>, great summary.</p>
<p>Minor nit, can we change the wording of ‘Spring 2021’ to something more internationally consistent? eg. a month or quarter in 2021.</p>

A migration script from CentOS 7/8 to our Rocky.</p>
