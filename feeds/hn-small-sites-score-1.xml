    <p>While there are many UI libraries available today to build modern web apps, the number of programming languages that compile to JavaScript has also increased in recent years. Here is a quick take on F# and TypeScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Although I did focus on mobile apps in the last years, I've spent the first decade or so of my career concatenating strings, also known as web development. So I think I might know a thing or two about how things work there.</p>
<p>However, as I watched the latest hype cycles in the JavaScript universe from the sidelines, I do not have many preferences when choosing "the right" technology stack. Except for one thing. I know for sure that I do not want to build serious software with JavaScript again, except when it acts as a compilation target for a more capable programming language.</p>
<p>So I did take a look at a couple of potential candidates: <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://reasonml.org/">Reason</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.</p>
<h2>Shortlist</h2>
<p>While I respect Elm and Reason, the overall experience seemed very close to web development with F#. Which can also be used for server-side tasks (even code-sharing between client and server is possible). So out of those four, F# and TypeScript are the most serious candidates for me. Sorry Elm. Sorry Reason.</p>
<h3>F#</h3>
<p>Since finally <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/who-cares-about-functional-programming">crossing the chasm</a> in 2017, I am a big fan of the language. As a long-time C# developer, it brought back the joy in programming to me. Making a case for using it in production at a larger scale project would intrigue me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, F# today is considered a language targeting two platforms: .NET and JavaScript. That is made possible through <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, "a compiler powered by Babel designed to make F# a first-class citizen of the JavaScript ecosystem" â€“ which sounds promising, doesn't it.</p>
<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>When Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> back in 2012, tooling was poor and excitement limited. It needed a significant player in the JavaScript world, Angular, to pick it up, to gain momentum. Today it is so widely used that I consider it the de facto standard for modern web development.</p>
<p>Its success is driven by a powerful type system plus the fact that it is similar enough to JavaScript to keep the learning curve relatively flat. Besides support for immutable data structures, I do not miss much of what I would expect from a modern programming language.</p>
<h2>A Small Case Study</h2>
<p>Now, how to make an informed decision that is not solely based on gut feelings? Good question. I decided to <a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa">conduct a small case study</a>, which I designed to explore three different options to build a type-safe single page application:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#elmish--feliz">F# + Elmish + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">F# + React Function Components + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">TypeScript + React</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, I wanted to find answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How are parent-child relationships handled?</li>
<li>How much boilerplate code needs to be written?</li>
<li>How much guidance and support provides the compiler?</li>
<li>How maintainable, aka scalable, does the approach appear to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to those questions have already been covered in a <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/scaling-model-view-update">separate post</a>. Summary: Going with React components, either with F# or TypeScript, will make you write less code. Whereas choosing MVU (with F# + Elmish) may provide more safeguards through an architecture that is easy to understand and harder to produce errors in.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: Technically, all three approaches are valid, each of them has different strengths and weaknesses. So I cannot recommend one over the other. But I can introduce some more things to consider when making that choice.</p>
<h2>More Things To Consider</h2>
<h3>Language Qualities</h3>
<p>Code written in F# for me more often than not is concise, easy to write, and even more comfortable to read, containing only very few noisy elements. I sometimes sit in front of my computer and just look at F# code, enjoying its beauty. Seriously, that's probably what sets it apart from most other languages I've had the chance to work with. And it brings literally back the joy in programming to me. That's a factor that cannot be stressed enough, in my opinion. I firmly believe that many bored or almost burned out, but very seasoned developers could quickly be sold on it and "flipped."</p>
<p>Whereas TypeScript certainly has different qualities. I like how it integrates with the JavaScript world, offering its type system's help where wanted. But allowing at the same time developers to keep writing their code in the JS style they are used to. It seems to walk the line perfectly fine between the strengths of a statically-typed language and some flexibility and freedom, e.g., through supporting duck-typing. So while I personally am not a big fan of curly braces and semicolons anymore, TypeScript surely provides an enjoyable developer experience as well.</p>
<h3>Vendor Support</h3>
<p>TypeScript receives a lot of attention, not only from Microsoft but industry-wide. I don't see a sign that its development might slow down in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Similarily, F# has always been supported by Microsoft since its inception, and a (small) team is actively working on it. So there is no reason to worry about the future of the language itself.</p>
<p>However, while TypeScript is the whole package of compiler plus language, F#'s web story is a bit different. It relies on Fable as the F# to JavaScript compiler. And Fable is a complex operation which, right now, depends on only a few people's willingness to continue to work on it in their spare time (also see "bus factor" below).</p>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>The tooling support for TypeScript is just great. For example, it integrates well in Visual Studio Code and is supported by many other editors and IDEs. Several of them are commercially supported.</p>
<p>The same is actually true for F#. Visual Studio (on Windows and macOS), <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Jetbrains Rider</a> (on Windows, macOS, and Linux) and <a href="https://ionide.io/">Ionide</a> (on all three platforms as well) support it.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>For TypeScript, a large amount of JavaScript packages are supported by the community. At the time of writing, there are 6,892 packages supported alone through the <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> project.</p>
<p>Whereas the situation for Fable and F# is not that bright at the moment. There is support for a few essential players, e.g., React and Electron. But if you want to use a small random library, you most likely have to create (and maintain!) those bindings by yourself. Which is not a really complicated task â€“ but one that steals time, which could otherwise be spent working on your own project. And if some of the maintainers of the existing bindings lose interest in them, there is a big chance you will inherit them sooner or later (again, see bus factor).</p>
<h3>Bus Factor</h3>
<p>The sheer number of stakeholders makes TypeScript a safe bet for most things, e.g., tooling or library support. It's not only backed and actively developed by Microsoft, but also used by major web frameworks like Angular (Google) and Vue, or at least officially supported (React, Facebook). But it's not only the impressive number of large players. The community also consists of a large number of individual contributors.</p>
<p>Fable, on the other hand, has a small but active community of contributors and a few companies that are backing it (e.g., through <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE Stack</a>). However, the key drivers of the whole ecosystem are only a dozen or so people who move the entire platform forward in their spare time.</p>
<p>I personally see the chance of reaching the tipping point where the ecosystem might be able to grow faster â€“ but that's totally subjective and possibly more wishful thinking than reality.</p>
<h3>The Pit Of Success</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">described by Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks. To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While TypeScript is a tool that integrates smoothly in the JS ecosystem, F# and Fable run on top of it. When using Elmish, JS is the eventual compilation target, and React is the execution layer on which the actual F# application is running without many external dependencies. Given this and the high robustness of the F# compiler plus the reliable guidance by the MVU architecture, it makes Fable and F# a poster child of the idea of the pit of success.</p>
<p>Whereas with TypeScript, every component might look different, depending on its author's taste and level of experience.</p>
<h3>Talent Pool</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that TypeScript is one of the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved programming languages</a> on earth at the time of writing. So it should not be complicated to find TypeScript developers or train any developer on using it.</p>
<p>While not at all being that popular, I think the story for F# might be more rewarding. There is a large pool of .NET developers who mainly use C# today. A language that adopted and continues to borrow more and more features from F# and that is getting more and more bloated on the way. As already mentioned: I believe that many talented and seasoned C# developers can be trained to use F#. This will make programming more enjoyable to them again and allow you to leverage their experience on the .NET platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are valid arguments for both TypeScript and F#. While I can and will not pick a winner at this point, I hope some information in this post can help you to make an informed decision yourself. I am sure it will be the right one! ;-)</p>

<p>… in which we attempt to recreate a game from the nineties using the <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/06/www.racket-lang.org">Racket</a> graphical facilities and we manage to do it in less than 1000 lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-play">The Game Play</h2>

<p>Instead of explaining the game, it is easier to show the game play. In the video below, the valid tiles are marked with their score, but this would be considered cheating in the actual game. The objective here, however, is to program the game, not to play it.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are in a hurry, you can go directly to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">the source code</a> for the game.</p>

<hr>

<p>
 <iframe width="700" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKMgURA5Wg8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<hr>

<p>The game is played on a 8x12 board with 72 tiles. There are six colors and six images which combined produce 36 unique tiles. Two of each tile are combined to make the playing set. The objective of the game is to place all the tiles on the board with the following rules:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a tile must be placed next to one or more tiles</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a tile can be placed next to another one if either their color or image  match. If there are multiple tiles around the tile, each neighbor must  match either the color or the image.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game starts with the first six tiles already on the board, one in each corner and two in the middle. The tiles are selected such that each possible color and each possible image is present on the board, thus ensuring that the very first tile can be placed on the board.</p>

<p>Scoring is done to reflect the complexity of the placement, with 1 point awarded if a tile is placed next to a single tile, 2 points for placing it against two tiles, 4 points for placing it against 3 neighbors and 8 points for placing it against 4.</p>

<p>The game ends when either there are no more tiles to be placed on the board or there is no valid location on which to place a tile.</p>

<h2 id="the-libraries">The Libraries</h2>

<p>Given that this is an interactive game where the user needs to drag tiles on a board, the easiest way to implement this game is to use <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/Snip_and_Style_Classes.html">snips</a> and a <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/editor-overview.html">pasteboard</a>. The <code>pasteboard%</code> is one of the two editors provided by the Racket GUI framework and it will handle most of drag and drop functionality which the game requires. To use it, we will need to provide two classes:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>snip%</code> class which represents a tile. A snip is an object which knows  its size and how to draw itself. You can do cool things with snips, such as  <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/map-snip.html">rendering maps</a> and even basic <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/interactive-heat-maps.html#embedded-snip-controls">GUI  controls</a>.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>pasteboard%</code> class which manages the snips (it can also draw things of  its own). While we can use the <code>pasteboard%</code> directly for testing purposes,  we will need to define our own class to implement the restrictions imposed  by the game.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game will also use the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html">racket/draw</a> facilities for drawing directly to a device context. The draw functions provided by <code>snip%</code> and <code>pasteboard%</code> already use <code>dc&lt;%&gt;</code> objects, and while we could have used the <code>pict</code> library for rendering, for this simple case, it was thought unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="the-assets">The Assets</h2>

<p>While the game board can be drawn using just lines, the game tiles will need six colors and six images, and it would help if these images would be nice ones, rather than using simply a circle, square and triangle shapes. The Unicode character set has lots of <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">emoji characters</a> to choose from, and these are directly supported by Racket, which means that they can be stored in strings.</p>

<p>In the game code, I choose to represent the unicode characters using the <code>\U</code> escape sequence followed by a code point, and during development using <code>display</code> or the <code>text</code> pict constructor to see the actual glyphs in the DrRacket REPL:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/glyphs.png" alt=""></p></div>

<p>Choosing six colors can also be a difficult task if we want colors which look nice, are visually distinct and are also distinct for color-blind people. I don’t know how to chose colors which meet all this criteria, so my preferred way is to find color schemes defined by others, in this case, one of <a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/">Paul Tol’s Color Schemes</a>, the “bright qualitative” one:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/colors.png" alt=""></p></div>

<h2 id="the-theme">The Theme</h2>

<p>Rather than storing the drawing assets (color and glyph) in each tile object, a helper class can be used to manage the common functionality and assets for all snips. A theme class also allows changing the “theme”, that is the colors and images at runtime — this is not implemented in this game, but could be added easily. Even without the ability to change themes, moving some common functionality in a separate class keeps the tile class simpler.</p>

<p>In addition to managing the graphics assets for drawing, the theme class also provides the size of each tile (the <code>cell-width</code> and <code>cell-height</code> fields). These are calculated by the board itself when it is resized and communicated to the theme and from here used by all tiles in the game:</p>



<h2 id="the-tiles">The Tiles</h2>

<p>The tiles represent the objects that can be moved on the board and they are implemented using snips. Two things are needed to create a new snip: define a snip class (not to be confused with a racket <code>class%</code>) and create a class derived from <code>snip%</code> overriding the <code>get-extent</code> and <code>draw</code> methods.</p>

<p>The snip class is used for serializing and de-serializing snip objects, but even though we don’t use this functionality in the game, we still need to define one. The definition is identical for any snip class, except they need to have unique names. Note that the snip class is actually an instance of <code>snip-class%</code> and not a class in itself:</p>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>We define our own <code>tile%</code> class derived from the <code>snip%</code> class. As far as the pasteboard is concerned, the new object needs to: (1) set the snip class for each instance (see the <code>set-snipclass</code> call below, (2) define a <code>get-extent</code> method which the pasteboard can use to determine the size of the snip and (3) define a draw method which is used to draw the snip.</p>

<p>In addition to the snip interface, also has a <strong>key</strong> a <strong>theme</strong> and a <strong>location</strong>. The <strong>key</strong> is a structure which contains the color and glyph codes for the tile and the <strong>theme</strong> is an object which holds the colors and glyphs used by the game (the tile class will ask the theme for the actual color to use corresponding to its key). The key and the theme are used for drawing the snip. Finally, the <strong>location</strong> is a structure which holds the location of the tile on the board (column and row). It is not used by the tile class at all, but it the pasteboard will need to know the location of each tile, so might as well store it inside the tile object you can find the full definition in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">game source code</a>.</p>



<p>With the tile snip defined, we can write a quick test program to see how it works. Here we will use just a plain <code>pasteboard%</code> which will display the snip and allow moving them around with the mouse. There are several objects which make up the “game”:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the <code>bq-colors</code>, and <code>bird-glyphs</code> define the colors and images to use for  the tiles and they are managed by the <code>theme</code> object</li>
 <li>the <code>board</code> is simply the <code>pasteboard%</code> instance we’ll use</li>
 <li><code>toplevel</code> is the toplevel GUI window for the application, an instance of  the <code>frame%</code> class</li>
 <li><code>canvas</code> is the <code>editor-canvas%</code> which acts as the view for the  <code>pasteboard%</code> (the pasteboard itself only manages snips, displaying is  handled by one or more <code>editor-canvas%</code> instances)</li></ul>

<p>The code also creates six tiles, one for each color and image and inserts them into the pasteboard.</p>

<p>The result is an interactive application, which allows dragging the snips around. The <code>pasteboard%</code> provides a lot of functionality out of the box, but it still needs to be further customized to restrict its functionality according to the rules of the game (for example, snips should only be placed in precise positions on a board):</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/pasteboard.gif" alt=""></p></div>

<h2 id="the-pouch">The Pouch</h2>

<p>Having defined the tiles, we need to produce 72 of them, preferably in random order, so it they can be used in the game. To generate all the possible tiles, we can use nested for loops over the all the possible colors and images:</p>



<p>The previous list is ordered by color and image, and we need to shuffle it:</p>



<p>Finally, and this is the tricky bit, the first six tiles need to have unique colors and images. This is because the first six tiles are already on the board when the game starts and to ensure that the user can always place the next tile, all the colors and images need to be on the board. To achieve this, we loop over the shuffled tiles and move the first six unique tiles to the front. Doing this ensures that, while the first tiles are unique, they also start in a random order for each game.</p>

    Circle eversion in two dimensions is impossible.

The figure above illustrates that there’s really nothing to do but introduce loops which we can’t then get rid of. Don’t take my word for it though! The classic video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO61D9x6lNY">Outside In</a> has an much more involved discussion of what happens when we try.</p><p>Since the original proof, a number of realizations of sphere eversion have been discovered, ranging in generality and complexity. This post follows the method of Bednorz and Bednorz from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10466">Analytic sphere eversion using ruled surfaces</a>.</p><p>Before stepping through the eversion, we lay out our ground rules, of which there are just two: We may not cut the surface, and the surface must always remain smooth.  Note that unlike physical objects, self-intersection <em>is</em> permitted.</p><h2 id="bednorz’-sphere-eversion">Bednorz’ Sphere Eversion</h2><p>We start with a full presentation of the sphere eversion of Bednorz and Bednorz in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10466">Analytic sphere eversion using ruled surfaces</a>. It goes by quickly, so we’ll then break it down and try to understand it a bit better. Along the way, you can drag the slider at the top to examine cross-sections.</p><p>
Quality: </p></div><div><p>Success! But that all happened very quickly. What happens at the top is clearly the key. In some sense, we do simply push one end of the sphere right through the other, but we need some clever tricks to keep the hole at the top smooth.</p><p>Bednorz and Bednorz break down the method as follows. As long as nothing topologically interesting happens at the poles of the sphere, we can simply remove them from the equation and focus on a cylindrical band around the equator. All that’s left then is to manipulate the cylindrical band carefully and replace the poles at the end of the process.</p><p>The key element of their method is a family of <em><a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RuledSurface.html">ruled surfaces</a></em>, or surfaces swept out by a straight line moving through space, which accomplish this task. They propose a family parameterized by time <span><span> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> </span></span>.

<h2>From the 80s to eternity</h2>



<p><strong>How BASIC made its way into the 21st century</strong></p>



<p>The BASIC language has been the gateway into programming for countless people. Popular as a beginner programming language in the 80’s and evolving into a powerful professional tool in 90’s, BASIC (and its successor QBasic), helped many people develop a love for programming. These languages provided the foundational learning platform for most of today’s professional developers.</p>



<p>The QB64 project has evolved over the last decade to bring the magic and educational potential of BASIC from its 20th century roots into the modern era. The QB64 project is already in use in both educational and professional contexts and has an active and helpful user community.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64 gets compiled automatically into machine code – allowing exceptional performance, easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++ programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64 adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern program development.</p>



<p>QB64 is available for all recent Windows, Linux, and macOS versions.</p>

                    <p>A few weeks ago, our team adopted a tool called <a href="https://www.pixelic.io/">Pixelic</a>, a UX collaboration tool that integrates with Figma and Slack to make design feedback, task management, and documentation more accessible.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Pixelic's Figma frames screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I observed our team go through multiple design iterations using the tool and thought it’d be helpful for other designers and teams to get a perspective on how Pixelic makes the UX design process much easier.</p><p>Here are three topics that I’ll be sharing:</p><ol><li>When do you use Pixelic? A use case for teams</li><li>Tracking history and product backlog through Pixelic</li><li>Creating a shared understanding via Pixelic and its efficacy</li></ol><h2 id="when-do-you-use-pixelic">When do you use Pixelic?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1566w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This process chart describes our team’s current UX design process from ideation to retrospectives.</figcaption></figure><p>Rows colored in yellow (from rough sketch, discussion/UX policies, to design QA) were design phases where Pixelic made our collaboration easier.</p><h2 id="improvement-points">Improvement Points</h2><p>Pixelic launched its first open beta in May 2020, so there were areas for improvement and a few features still in development.</p><p>We needed a wiki-like feature where we could take notes, store UX specifications, and share them with product and engineering teams. Notion and Zeplin were our go-to-tools for this during the “Understanding” phase in our design process.</p><p>It was pretty difficult to switch from Notion/Zeplin right away, but we hope to see more improvements in Pixelic’s documentation features.</p><h2 id="where-pixelic-came-in-handy-for-our-team">Where Pixelic came in handy for our team</h2><p>We realized that Pixelic could be a source of truth for the communication log as it integrates with Figma and Slack. This came in handy during our Design QA phase.</p><p>Before Pixelic, we had to manually create QA documents in Notion and share it with our engineering and product partners. We would copy and paste several links, upload screenshots, write thorough descriptions on the acceptance criteria.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1942w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sample Notion screen. There was so much to fill out in Notion to make our design QA work.</figcaption></figure><p>With Pixelic, we’re now able to just import Figma frames into the tool and write acceptance criteria using Pixelic’s annotation feature. There’s no need for us to take screenshots, copy/paste Zeplin links, and communicate with our engineering partners to create QA tasks. Pixelic did them all automatically.</p><h3 id="1-tracking-design-task-backlog-history">1) Tracking design task backlog history</h3><p>Not having an optimal product development and design process often made our workflow less productive. It looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Designer “A” and Developer “B” review design and exchange feedback in Slack</li><li>They then add the outcome (often design tasks) of the meeting to a Jira project Kanban board under the backlog</li><li>Product manager “C” notices the new task, but doesn’t have any context as to why it was created. So “C” requests designers “A” &amp; “B” to explain.</li><li>Teammates “A” &amp; “B” stop what they were doing, and loop C in so “C” could understand the context</li></ol><p>If only we had a place where the product manager (“C”) can read/understand the context behind a task or decision without asking the designers “A” and “B,” they would have kept their focus on doing more important tasks. We became less productive as a team due to redundant meetings and discussion. (Meetings are seldom productive!)</p><p>We found that Pixelic was a perfect tool for this pain point. Here are a few ways Pixelic helped us:</p><h3 id="2-pixelic-automates-task-creation-process">2) Pixelic automates task creation process</h3><p>It’s pretty difficult to keeping track of action items during design reviews. Someone has to take charge of translating discussions into actionable tasks and adding them to a project board while others continue discussing.</p><p>But with Pixelic, all you need to do is click the “taskify” button on each comment. Even during meetings, you can convert comments into tasks while viewing the design, so there’s no “context-switching cost” incurred. Pixelic lets you convert comments into tasks without diverging from the discussion.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/taskify.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/taskify.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/taskify.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/taskify.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/taskify.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>"Taskify" button on each comment on Pixelic converts respective comments into tasks</figcaption></figure><p>Traditionally, teams switch between communication apps (e.g., Slack) and task management apps (e.g., Jira, Notion, etc.) to go back and forth, discussing and adding tasks. Pixelic converges them together so that you can instantly flip the switch to “taskify” a comment.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Switching back and forth Slack and Notion to manage feedback and tasks at the same time is cumbersome.</figcaption></figure><p>Pixelic also has built-in version control for each Figma frame. With this feature, you can track all comments by each version.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="3-pixelic-tasks-connect-with-figma-frames-and-their-comments-2-ways-">3) Pixelic tasks connect with Figma frames and their comments “2-ways”</h3><p>Pixelic’s unique task management feature allows designers to access Figma frames directly from the tasks. This is different from what you see in Notion or Jira, Pixelic’s Figma integration imports actual Figma frames into the tool for you.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/task-comments.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/task-comments.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/task-comments.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/task-comments.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/task-comments.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figma frame comments are always connected with tasks bi-directionally.</figcaption></figure><p>This has two key benefits: (1) anyone can understand the context behind the task without asking others, and (2) view relevant Figma frames, or user flows without logging into Figma.</p><p>Engineers and product managers can access relevant UIs connected to each task and quickly understand the task.</p><p>Adding links, screenshots, and descriptions to each task on Jira or Asana is cumbersome if you have to do them every time. In Pixelic, since Figma frames are connected to each task, there’s no need to copy/paste links or screenshots.</p><blockquote>“What if we allow our users to sign up directly from the <strong>home screen</strong>?”</blockquote><p>Let’s say your colleague suggested above during a product meeting. How many of your team would think of the same screen? Was it the landing page? Sign up page? Main application page?</p><p>Without a shared understanding of the product, it’s challenging to communicate, and often people would have to elaborate with more details.</p><p>It’s too hard for people to see the forest through the trees, so to speak. Without the interface, people will think of different representations of the product. It’s just not an effective way to collaborate.</p><blockquote>“This wasn’t what I thought of.”<br>– said every stakeholder 🙄</blockquote><p>Driving shared understanding is crucial to make your workflow productive. Too often, teams revert back to ideation because they failed to align on the same page.</p><p>From my experience working at various startups as a product designer, what worked was communicating visually.</p><p>Visual communication saves not only the presenter’s time but also the audience because they can see what you’re seeing. Experts say a human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than texts.</p><h3 id="pixelic-is-the-ultimate-visual-communication-software">Pixelic is the ultimate visual communication software</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>I took a screenshot of our team discussion on Pixelic (in Korean).</figcaption></figure><p>In offline meetings, you can point out where you are talking about with your fingertips, but in remote settings, it’s not that simple. And remote collaboration via video conferencing now became the norm since COVID-19.</p><p>Pixelic helped us see the visuals (interface) as well as comments next to them while video conferencing. In Pixelic, you can click &amp; drag specific areas of the image and comment on them. This helped us to store everything so we could always go back to them later.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2><p>Yes, adding a tool to your already tool stack isn’t the most exciting thing for your team. But if the new tool replaces or complements your current stack to enhance team productivity, it’s a no brainer to adopt it.</p><p>Pixelic was a no brainer for us. Through Pixelic, we were able to enhance our team productivity. It helped us build a clear, shared understanding of our product across the team. And managing design projects were super easy and convenient thanks to its seamless integration with Figma.</p><p>There are some features that Pixelic still needs to add to replace our entire design collaboration tool stack, but ever since we started using Pixelic, its founders moved fast to add new fixes and updates every week.</p><p>The founders have been super supportive of any questions or requests we had. We’re excited to partner with the Pixelic team to build an optimal tool for software teams.</p><hr><p><em>Jieun is a product designer based in Seoul, South Korea.

Doing so over HTTP is implemented quite well in the default ESP8266 Arduino libraries, but for HTTPS requests things are more difficult. In this post I will discuss the most common approaches used by the community, and develop my own method to do arbitrary HTTPS requests in a secure way. This method will not require any specific certificates or fingerprints to be manually coded in the application.</p><p>HTTPS if a method to do a HTTP request over a TLS (formerly SSL) connection. By doing so, the data that is sent back and forth between your computer and the server is encrypted and protected. The good news is that this protocol can be used with the ESP8266 with the <span>WiFiClientSecure</span> class. The bad news is that the common methods to do so have some big disadvantages.</p><p>First I will show the two most common approaches, and next I will describe a generic solution to their problems.</p><h3>A word about certificates</h3><p>Before diving into the details I will briefly explain the basic principles of secure HTTPS requests in layman's terms.</p><p>Basically, every website has a certificate. This certificate is issued by somebody, who is called a certification authority (CA). Each CA certificate can be issued by another CA which leads to the so called certificate chain. In the picture the chain is 3 certificates long, but in reality the length of the chain can be anything.</p><p>A certificate chain. Image from Wikipedia</p><p>The top level certificate is called a root certificate. This certificate is self-signed, which means that it can be trusted inherently. This is because only a few organisations can issue root certificates, and these are trusted to not offer fake or wrong certificates.</p><p>When you do a HTTPS request to a website from your browser, the browser will look at the certificate for the website, and validating if the certificate is indeed issued by its parent. This can be done because each certificate is signed with the private key of the upstream certificate. An explanation for dummies on public and private keys work can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@vrypan/explaining-public-key-cryptography-to-non-geeks-f0994b3c2d5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>.</p><p>When it is verified that the certificate is indeed issued by a trusted root CA issuer, it is verified that the domain in the certicate is the same as the actual domain. If that is true, we know that the server is who it claims to be, and a secure connection can be started . </p><p>These trusted root certificates are actually stored as part of your browser to be able to validate all other certificates. Each OS or browser stores a slightly different set of roughly 100-200 root certificates, which it knows can be trusted. This is called a certificate store, and this is exactly what I will apply on the ESP8266 later in this article. But first, let's start with the two most popular other approaches.</p><h3>Fingerprints - secure but annoying</h3><p>The method that is proposed in the official ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/client-secure-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a> is to extract the fingerprint of a site's certificate and store this in the code. The fingerprint is a hash of the certificate. Because it is very unlikely that a second certificate exists with the same hash, we know the website can be trusted if the hash is the same as the one we store.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
const char<span>*</span> fingerpr <span>=</span> <span>"CF 05 98 89 CA FF 8E D8 5E 5C E0 C2 E4 F7 E6 C3 C7 50 DD 5C"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>client<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>fingerpr<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>{</span>  
    http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
        payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
<span>}</span>
<span>else</span> 
<span>{</span>
  <span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"certificate doesn't match"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This approach is simple because the certificate chain does not need to be validated, but has two main issues for me:</p><ol><li>The fingerprint needs to be extracted and stored manually for each page the ESP8266 needs to connect to.</li><li>An even bigger issue is that these fingerprints change roughly once a year when the certificate expires. This means that your program can break at any time and you manually need to update the fingerprint in your code.</li></ol><h3>client.setInsecure() - easy but unsafe</h3><p>You could argue that secure connections are overkill for your application. I would be the first to admit that I prefer a pragmatic solution where possible. Imagine that all you want to do with your ESP8266 is to fetch the weather from the internet and display it in some form. Personally I would not mind to do this in an insecure way, since there are no real dangers.</p><p>But imagine the ESP8266 is controlling the lock on your door or a 3D printer which can heat up and catch on fire. Or think of the case where you are transfering personal information to or from some site or API. In these cases it is better to be safe than sorry, and the method in this section should not be used. Nevertheless, I will show it here:</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>setInsecure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>//the magic line, use with caution</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
</code></pre><p>So basically all you need to do is to add <span>client.setInsecure()</span> to your code and it will start the connection without validating the certificate. </p><h3>HTTPS requests with the IoT framework</h3><p>With that out of the way, we finally get to the implementation I have chosen instead for my ESP8266 IoT Framework, which is placed in the <span>fetch</span> class.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>            

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>fetch<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span>host<span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    

fetch<span>.</span><span>clean</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Looks easy enough doesn't it ? So what happens behind the scenes? </p><p>Basically the same thing as in a typical Browser. The ESP8266 contains a full store of all the trusted root certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> memory. This takes roughly ~170 kB of flash memory at the moment, which in my case can easily be missed. This certificate store is generated automatically on building the sofware, no manual steps required. This also means that you can do secure HTTPS requests to any URL (so you could even configure or change a URL after the build).</p><p>You might think, but hey! These certificates will expire too. And this is true. The only difference with the fingerprints is that the validity of root certificates is much longer, and can be over 20 years. Whereas the fingerprint for some services can change every few months.</p><p>As a starting point I found a great but hidden example in the ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/examples/BearSSL_CertStore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>. This example contains a Python script that gets all the certificates from the Mozilla root certificate store and stores them as files. These files will then be uploaded to the <abbr title="SPIFFS is an abbreviation for 'Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System', which is a way to store files on embedded systems.">SPIFFS</abbr> and used during HTTPS requests. I adapted this example to be able to store the certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> instead.</p><h3>Generating a certificate store</h3><p>When a request is started, the <span>certStore</span> class will compare the hash of the certificate issuer with all the hashes of the stored root certificates. If there is a match, the correctness of the domain and other properties will be checked and the connection will be initialized.</p><p>In the default Arduino example these hashes for the stored certificates are generated in the <span>certStore</span> class. It seems more logical to me to do this directly in the Python script to save computing time on the ESP8266, so thats where I moved it. Furthermore I adapted the <span>certStore</span> class (<a href="https://github.com/maakbaas/esp8266-iot-framework/blob/master/src/certStore.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>) to read the information from my <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> variables rather than the file system. </p><p>The final Python script to generate the certificate store is shown below.</p><pre><code><span>from</span> __future__ <span>import</span> print_function

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的<a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/#chinese-version-below">读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Last weekend, I read <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/360061.html">a long, epic piece of techlore</a> that chronicled the fierce and bitter rivalry between TSMC and Samsung in their fight to become the world’s number 1 chip foundry, which stretched back three decades and continues today.</p><p>Among the many dramatic details was the “Nightingale program” that TSMC started in the mid-2010s to jumpstart its R&amp;D, because it was falling behind Samsung and losing Apple’s A9 chip orders to the Korean conglomerate. TSMC conceived of a three-shift, 24-hour non-stop R&amp;D operation, taking a page out of their fellow Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth Foxconn’s assembly operation. The “Nightingales” were engineers and researchers, who were willing to work the “graveyard shift” for a 30% increase in base salary and 50% increase in dividend payout. Due to this program, <strong>the total working hours clocked in Taiwan in 2014 was 2135</strong>, apparently the most of any economy in the world that year.</p><p>TSMC, and arguably Taiwan’s entire economy, was confronting an existential struggle at that time. SMIC (the largest chip foundry in China), and arguably China’s technological and economic future, is confronting a similarly existential struggle on a larger scale.</p><p>There are many interconnected elements that, when put together, could determine how China will come out on the other end of this struggle -- <strong>RISC-V, foundry technology, the “New Infrastructure” stimulus program, open source, and a few key TSMC personnels</strong>, who are now at the helm of China’s semiconductor industry.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each of them, sequentially and interconnectedly.</p><h2 id="risc-v-strengths-and-weaknesses">RISC-V: Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p>The conversation around China’s journey towards technological self-reliance often involves <strong>RISC-V</strong> -- an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware that’s under open source licenses, thus any one can run, change, copy, and distribute it, in accordance with<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"> the four freedoms</a> of open source.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sVMZ8L3CA61u_kc0hdRdB9AItYEuK65vUJ70os7CAaFpogycLyqhYL_BbwMndKktijiEAF8Bi9WLyKCmW5ztmGE3Zhw2dQrRP0VwWcxWIsUqTFVFfYXIS4K5wp_SDExCRiug0cE1" alt=""><figcaption>RISC-V Ecosystem, courtesy of SiFive.</figcaption></figure><p>However, RISC-V is still young. Its<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/"> user-space ISA</a> and<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/"> privileged ISA</a> wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for large-scale software and hardware development, until June 2019. The technology and community ecosystem is maturing, and support from large Chinese organizations has a lot to do with it. Of <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">the six Premier Members</a> of the official RISC-V foundation, RISC-V International, &nbsp;four are Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>But in the near future (say the next five years), what can RISC-V, the technology, realistically enable China to accomplish?</p><p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> &nbsp;RISC-V is a very good foundation for rapidly prototyping and building <strong>special purpose</strong> chips. The development cycle and experience feels closer to software than hardware. This speed in development is partly because it’s open-sourced -- no hassle in getting a commercial license, as oppose to its proprietary counterparts like ARM -- and also partly because the ISA itself is simplified and “reduced” (i.e. the R in RISC), as opposed to CISC (the C means “complex”) which underpins more powerful, proprietary ISAs like Intel’s x86. This reduced architecture enables and optimizes simple computation instructions well, literally elementary school math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It’s less capable of supporting complex mathematical operations, like matrix multiplication and partial derivative (used widely in Deep Learning AI).</p><p>Thus, in reality, chips designed using RISC-V have been used most commonly in <strong>IoT and embedded systems</strong> scenarios. Because of its simplicity and malleability, RISC-V chips also <strong>tend to have low power consumption</strong>, which is a good attribute when battery life is an issue, e.g. wearable devices. This reduced simplicity also means that the compiler (the software layer that translates code, like C, into machine instructions for a chip to execute) does not need to be purposefully designed to optimize performance on RISC-V. Using some common compilers <a href="https://riscv.org/software-status/#c-compilers-and-libraries">like GCC, which RISC-V </a>supports, will do.</p><p><strong>What does it lack? </strong>As you might’ve guessed, RISC-V’s reduced simplicity is also the source of its limitations. While many people like to pit RISC-V against a general purpose ISAs, like Intel’s, <strong>they are more compliments than competitors. </strong>In fact, special purpose RISC-V chips that accelerate certain computations for AI workloads do run side-by-side along general purpose Intel chips in the cloud. It’ll be a long time (more than five years, in my opinion) before RISC-V can enable the design of a <strong>general purpose</strong> chip that powers our iPhones, laptops, or cloud computing servers in a data center, with enough developers incentivized to both extend the ISA and the compiler and other infrastructure software on top of it.</p><p><strong>Can RISC-V become general purpose some day?</strong> Of course. <strong>But that’s not an inevitability</strong>. It’s <strong>a strategic choice</strong> that the RISC-V community can make and work towards, with all the complexity in upstream coordination, developer community building, and open governance, not to mention the work of building the technology itself, that must be executed collectively. That possible future is perhaps the most interesting question when we think about China’s self-reliance, which I’ll discuss in more detail below <strong>in the context of fostering open source</strong>.</p><h2 id="-new-infrastructure-">“New Infrastructure”</h2><p>With the strengths and weaknesses of RISC-V in mind, let’s see where RISC-V chips could get deployed in China’s economy and infrastructure in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It’s no secret that central government industrial policy matters a lot in China, even though its market-driven economy is what materializes much of that vision. The most relevant piece of policy is <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-04/22/content_75961988.htm">the “New Infrastructure” spending plan </a>that came out of the National Development and Reform Commission, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy. This infrastructure stimulus plan sits in a larger context of two other long-term strategic plans: Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035.</p><p>The details of this “New Infrastructure” plan have emerged in the last couple months, with major emphasis in IT and digital infrastructure, not just traditional infrastructure like highways and railroads. As it often happens in China, the signals sent from the top have already shifted private investment dollars. Nascent chip startups, all of a sudden, are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-analysis/sino-u-s-tech-race-turbo-charges-china-chip-investment-triggering-bubble-fear-idUKKBN23V3CO">enjoying investor attention and bubbly valuations</a>.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the “New Infrastructure” sectors that I think RISC-V could play an immediate role in, given its strengths:</p><ul><li>IoT</li><li>Smart transportation</li><li>New energy vehicle chargers</li><li>Limited AI (specific workloads that need customized acceleration)</li><li>Autonomous vehicles (limited to certain types of sensors and data collection)</li></ul><p>And as for sectors that I don’t see RISC-V making much of a dent, given its current limitations:</p><ul><li>Cloud computing</li><li>5G (both base station construction and consumer devices)</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Data centers</li><li>Big data</li><li>Large-scale AI training and production deployment</li></ul><p>As you can see, RISC-V impact would be limited,<strong> but not insignificant</strong>. The logical next step would be for China to help evolve RISC-V <strong>into a more general purpose ISA</strong>, and reduce its reliance on proprietary solutions from ARM or Intel that could always be subjected to more sanctions.</p><p>The path to that end would have to be fostering open source <strong>and doing it the right way.</strong></p><h2 id="fostering-open-source-the-right-way">Fostering Open Source, the Right Way</h2><p>Open source has been popping up in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qcze4R-7zL2wjMh_DNVCIQ">a lot of discussions</a> in various Chinese technical and R&amp;D communities, triggered in particular by MATLAB being now off-limit to Chinese universities that are on the U.S. export control entity list. The discussion inevitably leads to open source: are there open source alternatives to MATLAB? What about CAD softwares, like EDA tools, which every chip foundry needs? Will there be an open source EDA option?</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a predominant “takers” mentality towards open source. In China, open source solutions are mostly seen as “free stuff” that you can take and use, without any expectation or incentive to give back (or in open source parlance: “contribute upstream”).</p><p>It’s already happening in RISC-V. Alibaba <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date</a>, but there’s no intention to my knowledge for the design to also be open-sourced or at least publicly shared for the benefit of the ecosystem. Many small startups in China, now showered with new investments, are doing the same -- using RISC-V to make special purpose chips that are effectively proprietary.</p><p><em>(This is not to generalize that all Chinese organizations are bad open source players; some are contributing a lot and have open source in their DNA. I’ve profiled many of the big tech firms and some startups from the lens in Part II of my “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/"><em>Open Source in China</em></a><em>” series.)</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> China hopes to evolve RISC-V into a more powerful, general-purpose building block to achieve semiconductor self-reliance, Chinese organizations, both individually and collectively, would have to shift from a zero-sum “takers” mentality to a positive-sum “stakeholders” mentality. What that means in reality is absorbing and practicing the open source way of doing things -- not just contributing code upstream and being more willing to share, but also behaviors like transparent governance, open discussions with other stakeholders and developers, and clear due process for decision-making, big and small. <strong>These are both technical and human complexities.</strong></p><p>With an existential struggle at hand, there’s reason to believe that Chinese companies may behave differently for the sake of achieving a national imperative and be less concerned about the tit-for-tat, zero-sum nature of market competition, which is quite cutthroat in China. And<strong> if done right</strong>, RISC-V could unleash massive technological innovation broadly and help China deal with its existential struggle specifically.</p><h2 id="foundries-smic-hsmc">Foundries: SMIC, HSMC</h2><p>Let’…</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>In this article, we’ll tell you what the OKR concept implies and how to start adhering to it.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    When we grew from 10 to 30 people, we got to thinking we became defocused and asynchronous. One part of the team didn’t know what another one was doing; we were playing the Chinese whispers feeling we were heading separate ways. That’s exactly when we decided to adhere to OKR and we still do so.   </p>

  
</div>




<p>Many companies face the same problem, and the OKR framework helps tackle the issue, namely sync people up and help them move in the same direction while meeting their objectives. We’ve got some experience to tell you how you can implement OKR and why no one can do this right the first time (which is completely normal).</p>



<p>To make this article more insightful, we’ve talked to Ilya, a product &amp; strategy thinking mentor, and discovered his experience in implementing OKR in different companies.</p>



<p>Grab your pen and some paper and make notes on the OKR implementation as you read this article.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-is-the-okr">What is the OKR?</h2>



<p><strong>OKR (objectives and key results)</strong> is a goal-setting framework helping you determine the direction of your company’s growth, sync teams up, and engage all employees in the process of setting objectives and defining key results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objectives are set at these levels:</p>



<ul><li>company,</li><li>teams,</li><li>particular employees.</li></ul>



<p>Objectives are then decomposed into measurable results the company wants to achieve. The objective is marked as achieved if a certain result is met.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg" alt="mission strategy key results tasks" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg"></figure>



<p>OKRs first appeared in Intel and then moved to Google. Now many high profile companies like Spotify, Twitter, Airbnb, and Miro use them. It doesn’t mean OKRs can only be applied in the IT universe. You can use them anywhere! Even when planning your own life. I mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, my objective for the next 2 years is to learn French. My key results are to pass DALF for C1 and have 10 Tinder matches with native speakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The major thing about OKR is that both top management and the whole company are involved in defining objectives and key results. That’s why OKRs help you sync up with your team, move in the same direction, and increase the involvement of each team member as everyone knows how they can influence the achievement of a common objective.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-makes-okrs-so-great">What makes OKRs so great?</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg" alt="what makes OKR great" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg"></figure>



<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> to make sure OKRs work for good, the company should be 100% transparent for its employees. That’s the only way you can encourage the team to perform great. Every employee should have access to OKRs.</p>



<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> OKRs are easy to use and understand. Any person opening the OKR spreadsheet can easily get what it’s saying.</p>



<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> OKRs can be set for any term from a month to several years. This helps you set the pace of the company’s development and adjust to the environment quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Two-way goal-setting:</strong> OKRs are not set for teams by the top management. They can draw up the OKRs, but then they should pass them on to teams so that they can edit and adjust the OKRs. And there can be several iterations.</p>



<p><strong>Inspiring goals:</strong><strong> </strong>within the OKR concept, objectives should be ambitious and catchy. Inspiring objectives encourage the team to achieve better results. However, the OKR assumes that you can’t achieve 100% of your objectives and that’s completely okay.</p>



<p><strong>An OKR isn’t a KPI:</strong> The OKR concept doesn’t have an incentive system for achieving objectives. Non-monetary motivation establishes a welcoming environment. So, employees are willing to generate ambitious ideas and have no fear of not meeting the targets.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
  <p>
    An OKR isn’t a KPI. There’s no cash bonus for meeting the OKR. The concept is different, and that’s cool. An OKR isn’t something that should be 100% achieved. If we achieve 100% of our OKRs, it means our objectives were not ambitious enough. And vice versa, if we only achieved 30% of our OKRs, it means we’ve set the bar too high. Meeting around 70% of OKRs says we’re doing a great job.  </p>

  
</div>





<h2 id="objectives-key-results-and-initiatives">Objectives, key results, and initiatives</h2>



<p>How do we define Objectives and Key Results (KR)? John Doerr’s formula helps you get the difference between these two.<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> John Doerr</a> is the person who invented OKR and shared his knowledge with Google. Here’s his formula:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg" alt="i will be as measured by" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg"></figure>



<p>Within the concept, the objective setting is based on its definition and our perception of an achieved objective. The objective should describe the target, and the key results are the parameters we will use to know if we have met the objective. Let’s look closer at the formula:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg" alt="i will be happy in case" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg"></figure>



<p>Key results are an equally important part of the formula. They are decisive in whether an objective has been met or not.</p>



<p>Another way to understand KRs is to ask the question: “If our goal is X, what will success look like?”</p>


<div>
  <p>
    The OKR has an objective that may sound obscure in terms of the result, but it’s powerful and appealing. The second part is the key result, most often it’s a specific metric. The key result shows whether the objective has been met or not. If the goal is inspiring, then the KR reflects reality.  </p>

  
</div>




<h3><strong>What should be the objectives?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Objectives </strong>are catchy qualitative descriptions of what we want to achieve. Objectives should be concise, ambitious, inspiring, and engaging. They must encourage and challenge the team. In this case, the whole company will have a better chance of achieving greater success.</p>



<h3><strong>What are the “key results”?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Key results </strong>are a set of parameters that we use to assess how close we have gotten to our objective. Each objective usually involves between 3 to 5 KRs. If you pick more, the teams will find it hard to stay focused. Key results must be quantitative and measurable.</p>



<p>There are 2 kinds of key results:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Key action-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in completed/not completed projects.</li><li><strong>Key value-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in the value that the company or customers obtain.</li></ul>



<p>Here are some results of key action-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>the chatbot launch</li><li>an online course launching</li><li>the OKR book release</li></ul>



<p>Below are some key value-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>increasing the MRR from X to Y;</li><li>decreasing the Churn rate from X to Y;</li><li>increasing the ER from X to Y;</li><li>maintaining the CAC at around X.</li></ul>



<p>Take a look at the table of key action-driven results and their value equivalents:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg" alt="key action-driven results and key value-driven results" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>Key action-driven results are highly likely to fail in leading you to an objective. The release of a new feature is not a success guarantee. That’s why OKRs have to be value-driven. Only then can they be as effective as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key results should reflect the value to the company or its customers. Teams will be focused on achieving greater success and there’ll be more room for creativity. The employees won’t be stuck on a particular activity but will look for different ways to achieve the objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you’re implementing the concept for the first time, it makes more sense to choose actions as key results. They will help you to switch to OKR:</p>



<p>Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics. First, it’s a good idea to put a set of actions in KRs that we have to perform to get closer to the objective: release a huge feature or a marketing campaign. By the end of the OKR term, you’ll be able to evaluate the success based on the done/not done principle. Another very important point is to only include metrics that we know how to calculate in KRs.   </p>

  
</div>




<h3>How we did it at Dashly</h3>



<p>Last year, the goal for OKR in Dashly was to double the number of active users. It’s a catchy and quite ambitious goal, isn’t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do we know if we’ve achieved it or not? We’ve chosen key metric-based results and we’ve put all our effort to reach them and evaluate our success using them.</p>



<p>If objectives are about ambitions, key results must be clear and precise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key results for the “doubling” target could be the following:</p>



<ul><li>Increasing the MRR to X: this is our monthly revenue. If we want to grow, we should grow our revenue, too.&nbsp;</li><li>Decreasing the Churn rate to Y. The fewer users leave us, the easier it is for us to grow.</li><li>The CAC must not exceed: this is the Customer Acquisition Cost. If we want to be efficient, we can’t spend more than a certain amount on user acquisition.</li><li>Increasing the number of organic visitors to X. The more website visitors we have, the more purchases we generate.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>OKR initiatives</h3>



<p>Objectives and key results should be value-oriented. So, you must learn not to mix them up with activities and tasks that need to be done to achieve the OKR. Initiatives will help in this.</p>



<p><strong>Initiatives </strong>are the very activities, tasks, and projects that you need to accomplish to achieve the OKR.</p>



<p>Let’s get back to our goal of doubling up. We’ve chosen several key results we’ll use to evaluate our success in the future. The KRs are to increase the MRR to X and decrease the Churn rate to Y. And these are the initiatives:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>launching the chatbot: a huge and awesome feature will help decrease the customer churn;</li><li>online course release will help generate new target leads;</li><li>the OKR book release will help increase the number of product signups.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Serverless</strong> gives us the power to focus on delivering value to our customers without worrying about the maintenance and operations of the underlying compute resources. Cloud providers (like AWS), also give us a huge number of managed services that we can stitch together to create incredibly powerful, and massively scalable serverless microservices.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago now, I wrote a post on<strong> <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/">Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS</a>&nbsp;</strong>that became a popular reference for newbies and serverless veterans alike. The capabilities of serverless have changed dramatically since then, opening up a ton of new patterns and possibilities. This project is intended to capture, share, explore, and debate the patterns and practices being used in serverless production applications today.</p>
<p>I will be adding new patterns regularly, each with interactive architecture diagrams to help you better understand them, and sample templates for you to begin quickly implementing them in your serverless projects. <strong>This is a community effort, so <a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/reference-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributions</a> are welcome and greatly appreciated.</strong> Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

                          <p><em><span>Integrating a referral program has been proven to be the most effective way to drive new traffic. Before looking for a reliable </span><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/"><span>MVP development company</span></a><span>, make sure you know how to create a working referral program for your future startup.&nbsp;</span></em><span><br>
</span></p>
<p>First, let’s figure out together what the term ‘Referral program’ actually means. Basically, it’s is a recruiting strategy, that enables users to get some kind of benefits in exchange for referrals.</p>
<p>Two reasons why referral programs are super effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>We trust people more than advertising.</li>
<li>When buying goods or services we usually rely on users’ experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Referred users tend to be more loyal than people, who were attracted by advertising content. It generally takes them less time to try a new product and then make the first purchase.</p>
<p>Below we shared a couple of things to keep in mind when building a referral program for startup. Check them all to let your small business grow:</p>
<h2>Find a way to motivate users</h2>
<p>To create a truly working referral program for startup, think of what you may offer to make someone share your product with others.</p>
<p>Some product owners may think something like ‘Hey, my product is freaking awesome. Why should I stimulate users, who are already happy with it? Let us disappoint you — ‘being awesome’ is just a natural stare of things. If a product is NOT awesome (the entire concept, UI/UX), nothing will work. Don’t sit it out waiting for new customers to come — it is nothing but a waste of time and money.</p>
<p>To make users recommend you, take into account their social activity. Be it an app for pet owners or a free-trial music marketplace, users are just ordinary people who care primarily about their own problems. Will they spare even a few minutes of their precious time to send referral-invites?</p>

<h5>Being ‘just awesome’ isn’t truly awesome</h5>
<p>You might say ‘Ok. How much should I pay for every new user?’ In some cases, money reward doesn’t even work. Why? Because some users may think that the product price isn’t attractive enough to make them believe that recommending ‘this thing’ to friends is a good idea. In this case, it’s better to give them stuff like extra storage space or free premium subscription.</p>
<p>A few examples for you to check:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When the majority of Dropbox users wanted to get extra storage space, the company launched a referral program with extra space for each new user invited. For every referral, both a user and a referral got 500MB of free storage space. With a free account, the user could invite up to 32 new users for a whopping total of 16 GB of bonus storage space. Pro account users earned 1 GB per referral, for a total of 32 GB of bonus storage space.</em></p>
<p><em>Trello gives a free month of Trello Gold (up to 12 months) for every person you get to join this app.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Figure out what a referral action will be</h2>
<p>How to create a working referral program for startup? Find out what a user should do to get benefits. A user must achieve the main goal — attract new customers to your startup. And this is what you should reward for — for the provided value, not actions.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When people invite friends to Evernote, they earn points. Points can be used for monthly or annual subscriptions to Evernote Premium.</em></p></blockquote>
<h5>Reward not for sending invitations, but for new users</h5>
<h2>Is there anything else to keep in mind?</h2>
<p>Clearly explain the required referral actions in your marketing messages. Help users understand what exactly they should do and how they’ll be rewarded. Use plain language and provide all the needed details —&nbsp; a quick demo or an overview with referral program rules will be more than enough.</p>

July 2, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/top-concerns-when-choosing-a-tech-stack-for-your-personal-website | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/top-concerns-when-choosing-a-tech-stack-for-your-personal-website">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="frontend-stack">Frontend Stack</h2>
<p>Until somewhat recently, I think that hosting was probably a more important concern for creating a personal site than the frontend stack. But with options like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the hosting part of the equation has become a whole lot easier. Nowadays a personal site is all about what you build it with. I think it's fair to say most people looking to build a personal site are, in equal parts, wanting to get a professional foothold on the web and also just have fun building something new. And when building something new, there is a whole lot of new out there. So much so, that many people cannot even bring themselves to begin because they're afraid of picking the wrong stack.</p>
<h3 id="picking-a-framework">Picking A Framework</h3>
<p>A good question to ask yourself when picking a framework is which of the two following focuses is most important to you.</p>
<h4 id="1-javascript">1) Javascript</h4>
<p>Javascript, the necessary evil turned eternal turf war, is probably at top of mind for most people looking to build a personal site in order to "play with new tech". This is also a great splitter of options if you do know what javascript framework you want to work in. If you still cannot decide on a framework, then you probably have more this vs that javascript framework articles to read.</p>
<h5 id="react">React</h5>
<p>If you must work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsbyjs</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> are very popular and capable options. Gatsbyjs takes a more holistic approach between the frontend and the backend whereas Nextjs is mostly concerned with creating a static and ssr environment for React apps.</p>
<h5 id="vuejs">VueJs</h5>
<p>If you must work with Vuejs (my personal favorite), <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxtjs</a> (what <a href="https://formcake.com/">formcake.com</a> is build on), <a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</a>, and <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a> are all great options. As is often the case in the world of Vue, it is often easiest to compare Vue based project's with their React equivalents. Gridsome is like Gatsbyjs and Nuxtjs is like Nextjs. VuePress is much more targeted to those who want to create a site for blogging.</p>
<h5 id="angular">Angular</h5>
<p>I cannot really imagine someone making a personal site in Angular unless they really want to force themselves to learn Angular for a job of some kind but there is an interesting <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> static site generator project called <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully">Scully</a> that I have been meaning to try. If anyone reading this has played with Scully, send me your thoughts to <a href="mailto:david@formcake.com">david@formcake.com</a>.</p>
<h5 id="x-cool-kid-framework">X Cool Kid Framework</h5>
<p>You are on your own.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are more concerned with creating a blog and how a framework's authoring experience works than what technology powers the rendering of html. X JS forward frameworks tend to require a lot more configuration than those made specifically for creating a simple site. If this is your situation, you are in luck. There are tons of options and they are all fantastic for this purpose. I will go more in depth on some of these options since they are more tailored for a small perosnal site.</p>
<h5 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h5>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the one of the oldest static site generators that made authoring a top concern with its use of Markdown. Built in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Jekyll was part of the Rails era of web development where developer productivity was considered paramount to everything else. Jekyll is still very popular but is a bit of a non starter for many because it is built in Ruby. Still a great choice for a developer blog but you will have to use RubyGems instead of NPM.</p>
<h5 id="hugo">Hugo</h5>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a more modren framework than Jekyll. It tries to solve more problems out of the box than Jekyll, is more flexible, and considers the speed at which it creates pages to be a top concern. Part of Hugo's popularity comes from the fact that it is written in Go. This contributes to its speed but also contributes to some of the annoying aspects about it. Go is an interesting language but most of us don't have the opportunity to use it in our work. It is therefore best for those who love Go and don't mind using Go's templating libraries. You will also have to give up NPM if you choose Hugo.</p>
<h5 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h5>
<p>One of the newest kids on the block, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is somewhere inbetween Hugo and Jekyll. It's focus is on flexibility and speed. It is super modular so it does take a little bit more time to get setup but for those looking for flexiblity, Eleventy has it in spades. It supports 11 templating language and best of all, it is a node library so you can use NPM for your entire project. This may be my personal choice if I were creating a new blog.</p>
<h2 id="other-concerns">Other Concerns</h2>
<h4 id="3-static">3) Static????</h4>
<p>Yes. In 2020 there is no reason to choose a framework that does not support static generation of pages for a small personal website. Every framework listed above supports static generation. If you need to be convinced of the power of static websites, checkout <a href="https://jamstack.org/">jamstack.org</a> which does a good job of going into all the benifits.</p>
<h4 id="4-hosting">4) Hosting</h4>
<p>As long as we have made the decision to use static generation, hosting is quite easy. There are still a lot of options however. Here are some of the top options and some of the thinking for when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="netlify">Netlify</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is the hosting platform behind the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> movement. Founded in 2014, Netlify has grown rather quickly and has become the defacto hosting platform for static sites. With Netlify you can host static sites, deploy lambdas, and create git based workflows with extreme ease. I would recommend Netlify above all other options for a personal site.</p>
<h5 id="vercel-previously-zeit">Vercel (Previously Zeit)</h5>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is a very similar hosting platform as Netlify. Founded in 2015, Vercel boasts a fully featured platform for hosting static sites including git workflows and lambdas. I have used Vercel for years and I can recommend it. Vercel is a solid choice but I would recommend Netlify above Vercel for a fully featured static hosting platform.</p>
<h5 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h5>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> is quite an old option in the space of static website hosting. Launched in 2008 Github pages originally only supported Jekyll and static files but now supports other frameworks through some configuration. Github pages was once unique in that it automatically was integreted into your github account but this is now a common feature with the likes of Netlify and Vercel. Github pages is underpowered at this point but will always be free. If you want to host something simple and never think about it again, Github pages may be just the right choice.</p>
<h5 id="firebase">Firebase</h5>
<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a platform as a service hosting provider that has some seriously robust features and is backed by Google. Firebase is not a static website hosting provider and aims to solve much more complicated issues around creating and hosting a sophisticated web application. The only reason you would want to choose Firebase is if you wanted authentication for some reason. Firebase allows for simple authentication and storage via it's flagship features <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth">Firebase Authentication</a> and Firebase <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database">Realtime Database</a>. Firebase may also be a good option if you want to play with server tech but don't want to go too deep into the subject.</p>
<h5 id="heroku">Heroku</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> lit the world of application hosting on fire in 2007 when it made hosting a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application as simple as a couple of key strokes using the Heroku CLI. Like Firebase, Heroku aims to solve much more complex problems than a simple static website but is a great system for those who like to tinker with their backend. Heroku is for those who need to solve more complicated problems like storage or authentication, but want to do it with open source software instead of google invented technologies. If you are building a personal site to learn server tech, Heroku is a great option.</p>
<h4 id="5-apis">5) APIs</h4>
<p>Assuming you went with one of the hosting platforms specifically designed for simple static websites, you may be wondering "But what if I need a server for X". You are in luck, there is a great resource created by <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyer</a>, of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> fame, that lists services that are great for static websites without a server, <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major">https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major</a>. <a href="http://formcake.com/">Formcake</a> also perfectly solves the problem of how to create a contact form on a static website. Formcake is committed to always having a useful free tier for developers with small projects. Consider checking it out the next time you tackle building your personal site.</p>

The limited control over the files content makes exploitation very hard; perhaps crafting an executable PowerShell script or bat file is plausible, but then there is the problem of getting those executed.</p><p>Instead, I chose to combine my active trace recording with a call to:</p><pre><code>WINRT_IMPL_AUTO(Windows<span>::</span>Foundation<span>::</span>IAsyncAction) SnapCustomTraceAsync(param<span>::</span>hstring <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> outputDirectory)
</code></pre><p>When supplying an <code>outputDirectory</code> value located inside <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> (Where the <code>.etl</code> files of my running trace are saved) an interesting behavior emerges.</p><p>The Diagtrack Service will rename <em>all</em> the created <code>.etl</code> files in <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> to the directory given as the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument to <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>. This allows destination control to be acquired because rename operations that occur where the source file gets created in a folder that grants non-privileged users write access are exploitable. This is due to the permission inheritance of files and their parent directories. When a file is moved by a rename operation, the DACL does not change. What this means is that if we can make the destination become <code>%WINDIR%\System32</code>, and somehow move the file then we will still have write permission to the file. So, we know we control the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument of <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>, but some limitations exist.</p><p>If the chosen <code>outputDirectory</code> is not a child of <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>, the rename will not happen. The <code>outputDirectory</code> cannot exist because the Diagtrack Service has to create it. When created, it is created with SYSTEM as its owner; only the READ permission is granted to users.</p><p>This is problematic as we cannot make the directory into a mount point. Even if we had the required permissions, we would be stopped by not being able to empty the directory because Diagtrack has placed the snapshot output etl file inside it. Lucky for us, we can circumvent these obstacles by creating two levels of indirection between the <code>outputDirectory</code> destination and <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>.</p><p>By creating the folder <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections</code> and supplying <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> as the <code>outputDirectory</code> we allow Diagtrack to create the snap folder with its limited permissions, as we are inside <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>. With this, we can rename the <code>extra</code> folder, as it is created by us. The two levels of indirection is necessary to bypass the locking of the directory due to Diagtrack having open files inside the directory. When <code>extra</code> is renamed, we can recreate <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> (which is now empty) and we have full permissions to it as we are the owner!</p><p>Now, we can turn <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> into a mount point targeted at <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code> and Diagtrack will move all files matching <code>WPR_initiated_DiagTrack*.etl*</code> into <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code>. The files will still be writeable as they were created in a folder that granted users permission to WRITE. Unfortunately, having full control over a file in System32 is not quite enough for code execution… that is, unless we have a way of executing user controllable filenames - like the DiagnosticHub plugin method popularized by <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/tiraniddo">James Forshaw</a></strong>. There’s a caveat though, DiagnosticHub now requires any DLL it loads to be signed by Microsoft, but we do have some ways to execute a DLL file in system32 under SYSTEM security context - if the filename is something specific. Another snag though is that the filename is not controllable. So, how can we take control?</p><p>If instead of making the mountpoint target System32, we target an Object Directory in the NT namespace and create a symbolic link with the same name as the rename destination file, we gain control over the filename. The target of the symbolic link will become the rename operations destination. For instance, setting it to<code>\??\%WINDIR%\system32\phoneinfo.dll</code> results in write permission to a file the Error Reporting service will load and execute when an error report is submitted out of process. For my mountpoint target I chose <code>\RPC Control</code> as it allows all users to create symbolic links inside.</p><p>Let’s try it!</p><p>When Diagtrack should have done the rename, nothing happened. This is because, before the rename operation is done, the destination folder is opened, but now is an object directory. This means it’s unable to be opened by the file/directory API calls. This can be circumvented by timing the creation of the mount point to be after the opening of the folder, but before the rename. Normally in such situations, I create a file in the destination folder with the same name as the rename destination file. Then …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>I’ve been thinking about designing my own programming language for a long time. I’ve actually been keeping a lot of notes, and even throwing together some code when I can find time. My plan is to build something that takes inspiration from LISP, JavaScript and Smalltalk. I think there’s a niche to be filled. There are many new programming languages coming out lately, but most of them are statically typed and compiled ahead of time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic languages</a> that do come out often don’t perform very well (see CPython, Ruby) or have poorly thought out&nbsp;semantics.</p>
<p>I’ve written a few&nbsp;blog posts pointing and laughing at perceived failures of JavaScript, but the truth is that programming language design is hard.&nbsp;There’s no limit to the complexity of the things you can build with programming code. No matter the design choices you make, no matter the language you design, there are bound&nbsp;to be some inconsistencies and weaknesses somewhere.&nbsp;I think that Smalltalk is a very inspiring programming language, revolutionary in many ways, but it’s also one that has gone extinct. It’s interesting, in my opinion, to ask ourselves why Python thrives but Smalltalk died.</p>
<p>Like LISP, Smalltalk implemented some interesting features which have influenced other languages (such as Java and JavaScript). Some nifty features of Smalltalk are really cool, but still aren’t implemented in any other language. For instance, Smalltalk had the ability to suspend running programs into a saved image, and resume execution later at the saved point. As you can imagine, this is extremely powerful and useful. Forget saving documents or saving games, just save the state of an entire program, no implementation effort required.</p>
<p>I found an interesting talk on YouTube titled “What Killed Smalltalk could Kill Ruby Too”:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX3iRjKj7C0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Robert Martin makes the case that one of the big weaknesses of Smalltalk is&nbsp;that it was just “too easy to make a mess”. Smalltalk was highly dynamic, and encouraged people to “monkey patch” things and do quick fixes/hacks.&nbsp;He also makes the point that Smalltalk just “didn’t play well with others”. When you think about it, Smalltalk had its own source control, IDE and GUI built into live images, living alongside your program. Smalltalk isn’t just a language, it’s an operating system and a way of life. It’s conflating things that would maybe be best left separate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in some key areas, the&nbsp;Smalltalk creators placed their own radical ideas above everything else. They chose idealism over pragmatism. Smalltalk was a language created with a grandiose vision. It had some deeply rooted principles which didn’t necessarily work so well in practice, such as the idea that everything had to be an object, that the object metaphor should be applied everywhere, one size fits all.&nbsp;At the end of the day, programmers want to get things done and be productive. If the language design or implementation gets in the way of getting things done, people will leave. Pragmatism is key for a programming language to succeed.</p>
<p>Smalltalk was also designed with the idea that it should be easy to learn and intuitive. This has led its creators to have a heavy focus on graphical user interfaces.&nbsp;I watched an introduction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774">Self on YouTube</a>&nbsp;(Self is a direct descendent of Smalltalk) and saw the heavy emphasis on interacting with objects through UIs. The user interfaces showcased in this video are, in my opinion, horribly complex and unintuitive. Pretty much all of the interactions done through the UI would have been simpler and easier to understand if they had been done by writing one or two lines of code instead!</p>
<p>When you sit down and think about it for one second, you have to realize that programming doesn’t fundamentally have anything to do with graphical user interfaces. Yes, you can use programming code to create GUIs, but there is no reason that programming should have to involve GUIs and be tied to them. The metaphor of writing code has been extremely successful since the very beginning, and it probably makes more sense to the mathematical mind of a skilled programmer. Not everything has to have a visual metaphor. This is again a case of pushing some idealistic principle too far, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I believe that a lack of pragmatism is something that has killed many languages. Not just Smalltalk, but Scheme too. My first experience with Scheme involved trying and failing to install multiple Scheme distributions because I couldn’t get all the dependencies to work. Then, finally getting a Scheme compiler installed, and struggling to implement simple routines to parse text files, because Scheme doesn’t include&nbsp;the most basic string routines. The Scheme compiler I’d selected bragged that the code it produced was highly optimized, but once I finally managed to write my own string routines, I compiled my program, ran it, and it was dog slow.&nbsp;Parsing a one-megabyte CSV spreadsheet took over a minute. I ended up rewriting the code in Python. Why don’t more people code in Scheme? Because they try to realize their ideas in Scheme, and it just doesn’t quite work out.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It is natural that we would like to employ progress bars in our programs to show the progress of tasks. <code>tqdm</code> is one of my favorite progressing bar tools in Python. It could be easily incorporated to Python using <code>trange</code> to replace <code>range</code> or using <code>tqdm.tqdm</code> to wrap iterators, in order to show progress bars for a <code>for</code> loop.</p>



<p>Multiprocessing tasks should also have progress bars to show the progress. However, the incorporation of <code>tqdm</code> and <code>multiprocessing</code> was not well documented in Python. In this blog post, I would like to present several ways of using <code>multiprocessing</code> with <code>tqdm</code>.</p>

<h3 id="python-multiprocessing">Python Multiprocessing</h3>

<p>Let’s first take a look at some of the basic class methods in Python <code>multiprocessing</code> library. The commonly used <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> methods could be broadly categorized as <code>apply</code> and <code>map</code>. <code>apply</code> is applying some arguments for a function. <code>map</code> is a higher level abstraction for <code>apply</code>, applying each element in an iterable for a same function.</p>



<p>More specifically, the commonly used <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> methods are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>apply_async</code></li>
  <li><code>map</code></li>
  <li><code>map_async</code></li>
  <li><code>imap</code></li>
  <li><code>imap_unordered</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>apply_async</code> and <code>map_async</code> return “future results” immediately, we would need to collect the results using <code>get</code>. <code>map</code>, although it is running functions in parallel, blocks the return of the results until they are ready. <code>imap</code> is a lazier version of <code>map</code>, but it will return an iterator for the processes. <code>imap_unordered</code> is similar to <code>imap</code>, but the execution and returned result order of <code>imap_unordered</code> does not necessarily follow the order of arguments provided.</p>



<p>Based on the nature of these methods, <code>apply_async</code>, <code>imap</code>, <code>imap_unordered</code> are naturally compatible with <code>tqdm</code> to show progress bars.</p>

<h3 id="python-multiprocessing-tqdm-examples">Python Multiprocessing tqdm Examples</h3>

<h4 id="many-small-processes">Many Small Processes</h4>

<p>Sometimes, the entire task consists of many small processes, each of which does not take too much time to finish. The number of processes is much larger than the number of processes we could assign to the <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code>. We would like to monitor the progress of the entire task using one progressing bar.</p>



<p>The bottom line is not modifying the functions we would like to run using <code>multiprocessing</code> and <code>tqdm</code>. In the following examples, I have implemented the examples of using <code>apply_async</code>, <code>imap</code>, <code>imap_unordered</code> with <code>tqdm</code> for functions that take one single argument or multiple arguments.</p>

<p>During the execution of the multiprocessing program, we could see that the 100 jobs were run in 10 batches whose batch size is 10. Each batch roughly takes 0.5 seconds, and the total execution time is roughly 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the entire task consists of few large processes, each of which takes long time to finish. We would like to monitor each of the progress using multiple progress bars.</p>

        <div>

            

            <p>I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but Belle and I have made a SaaS product with web, Android, and iOS apps, starting from scratch, and over the years built it to the point where it pays us both to work on it full-time. That's my idea of success. I'm not interested in being wealthy, or taking venture capital, or scaling beyond the two of us. </p>
<p>Here are some things I've learned along the way. If you think you might like to do something along the lines of what I've described, perhaps you'll find these opinions useful, although I imagine most are not very novel. Many are related so forgive me for repeating myself. </p>
<p>All of these are based on my own experience and values and may be totally the wrong advice for you.</p>
<p><strong>It's okay to start with the technologies you know.</strong> In fact, I strongly recommend it. If you're good at JavaScript, write your backend in Node. If you make iOS apps, start with an app and use something like Firebase if you need server-side bits. Don't start by learning something new, you'll just make something that's already difficult that much harder. (Learn new stuff later, though. That's fine and keeps it fun.)</p>
<p><strong>Things really will go better if you build something you'll use yourself.</strong> Dogfood it. It'll also help you maintain an interest in building it once the novelty of having users and income wears off.</p>
<p><strong>YAGNI <small>(You Ain't Gonna Need It)</small> is a good aphorism but don't take it to mean you can only build what you need today and no more.</strong> I think it's fine to build things in a generic way you can extend. I feel fortunate that Exist's core is still fundamentally the same today, seven years later, because I tried to design a generic data model and integrations architecture that could account for the things we might add. Don't over-architect it, sure, but don't be short-sighted either.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need to go through an incubator or accelerator.</strong> You don't need external funding. These things are undoubtedly useful in some circumstances but they are marketed as a necessity, and even glamorous, because they make other people money. Don't chase status symbols for their own sake. Why give up equity? Why give your investors the means to make decisions for you? Their interests are not necessarily aligned with yours. I'm not saying never do it, just consider your needs instead of taking it as a given.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need to be a "startup".</strong> Your end goal doesn't have to be "CEO of a big tech company with lots of employees". There are viable alternatives and being an indie-sized business is quite a comfortable way to do things.</p>
<p><strong>Mentors are good for support when things are hard, but remember that the person who best understands what you want to do is you.</strong> If they give you conflicting advice, try to understand their viewpoint, and if you still think you know better, ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>If you can make it fit into your life, bootstrapping works fine.</strong> You might move a lot more slowly because you're only working on your product when you're not at your day job, but this doesn't have to be a huge disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>More generally, you <em>can</em> do it your own way.</strong> We took a lot of actions contrary to the prevailing view of the time, partly just because I like to be contrary, and it worked out. That might just be a combination of luck and privilege, but it's evidence you can point to if someone says things like "you can't get by without an incubator", or "you can't compete with a venture-backed startup as a bootstrapped company of two people who do no marketing", for example.</p>
<p><strong>Don't underestimate persistence.</strong> I don't have a lot of time for PG these days but I do think there's a lot of truth to his saying, "Startups die of suicide, not homicide." We're still here because we kept going even when we weren't making enough money and it wasn't clear that we ever would. We've outlived many competitors, even some who appeared years later. If you just keep going you may eventually get where you want to be. If we'd "failed fast" because one year in we were making hardly any money, we'd probably both still work for other people. </p>
<p><strong>Be authentic.</strong> Be yourself, a human being with flaws who has likes and dislikes and bad days. Don't act like you're a big faceless entity. It won't make people trust you more. Just be you, and be honest if you fucked up, or if you're never going to add that feature, or if you added it because you personally wanted it and you don't care if anyone else did. Paradoxically, it can be better to be open with your users about making mistakes and breaking things than to appear to never break things.</p>
<p><strong>Be open.</strong> Share whatever you can. Be transparent about what you're working on, what you want to do next, how much you're making, and how you're feeling about it. A lot of the goodwill users have towards us is because we have an open roadmap and we publish user and income stats.</p>
<p><strong>Be empathetic.</strong> Try to relate to your users as one human to another. Make the effort to understand why they are angry, or rude, or just don't care about your thing. You will fail a lot, and they won't always deserve it, but a lot of good will come of it. Acknowledge their point of view. When we first opened our pre-launch waiting list for Exist, we got some pretty rude feedback about trying to vacuum up everyone's data to sell, or that our idea was dumb, or that we shouldn't be trying to charge for something nobody would pay for. In each case I tried to understand why someone would feel that way and honestly address their concerns. In nearly every case I succeeded in turning the interaction into a positive one and many of those people signed up. I don't always have the energy to do that any more, and you get better at knowing when to just let it go, but I still believe it's something to strive for.</p>
<p><strong>Be good at support.</strong> Man, the bar for support is just so low, especially for indie software. You've probably experienced emailing the developer of an app you use about a bug and just never getting a reply, right? Replying to support tickets alone probably puts you in the top 50% straight off the bat. Replying quickly, even better, and then caring about the issue and fixing it, would seriously push you into the top 10%. Unless you get a lot of support, it's not even that hard to do, and it's such a good way to make your users think well of you. Again, you'll probably lose the motivation to be prompt and kind over time, but it's always something to strive for.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to user feedback.</strong> User suggestions are useful, and if you track what's popular you'll definitely identify trends worth pursuing. Still, temper them with your own strong ideas about what you're making. Don't just add stuff because one person made a big fuss about your product being useless without it. Get comfortable telling people you are not adding their thing just because they asked for it. As a related point, the loudest users are usually not indicative of the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Get to know your users.</strong> If you are friendly, they will be friendly to you and care about you and your thing, and maybe you will care about them and their things too and you can be friends. Be generous if you can afford to, and probably even if you can't. </p>
<p><strong>Be open to your role changing.</strong> This is a pretty obvious one but you'll have to wear a lot of hats and it might turn out that someone needs to write lots of docs, or do a lot of regular support, and you thought you were just here to code the backend. Things can change and there'll probably be plenty of tasks where there's just nobody else to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, you probably can get away with not doing stuff you really don't want to do.</strong> For example, we don't really do much explicit marketing now because it was Belle's role and she stopped wanting to do it and switched to iOS development. As a compromise we recorded a podcast together irregularly but because I never enjoyed doing it we stopped that too. Would we be better off with more marketing? Almost certainly. But we can get away with not doing it because we hate it and we're established enough now from having been around for years and having done the work earlier. This probably won't translate to everything, for example you can't just not write docs if you make a developer tool, but perhaps you can find a compromise that's tolerable for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you do think you need marketing but you don't like the regular methods, you can try just boosting your personal profile.</strong> Write blog posts, go to your local meetups (when those are a thing again), share screenshots of what you're working on to social media. If that still feels too much like selling yourself (and I sympathise), you could try just doing regular release notes posts for your product, or highlighting technical stuff you're doing, or even just sharing user stats. It doesn't need to be "here's why this is so great", it's just a chance for your thing to be more visible.</p>
<p><strong>Being visible gives you more chances at being visible</strong>, for example people might want to interview you about your work. I like this approach because you can just answer questions honestly and it counts as marketing. </p>
<p><strong>Don't waste time on collaborations, opportunities to work together, or deals with big companies.</strong> Because that's all you'll get out of it — wasted time. In general, anyone you don't know who wants to "hop on a call" with you will only waste your time. Even if there's, like, <em>so much</em> synergy.</p>
<p><strong>I strongly recommend you charge everyone who uses your product.</strong> Free plans only get you freeloaders.</p>
<p><strong>If you get a chargeback, just accept it — you will never win your dispute.</strong> We initially disputed every chargeback and went to the effort to prove that the user had knowingly paid for and used our product. We never won. Just accept the chargeback and then cancel that user's subscription. If someone is going to take that route rather than contacting support or asking for a refund, it's easier just to let them go as a customer. </p>
<p><strong>Offer refunds gladly.</strong> It means more to the user to get a refund than it's worth to you …</p></div></div></div>

From Brasilia to Warsaw and from Delhi to Washington, authoritarian populists are attacking free speech, stoking the ugliest passions of bigots and racists, and concentrating power in their own hands. To safeguard the great cultural and political progress of the past half century, those of us who believe in the values of a free society need to rise to the fight of a lifetime.</p><p>At the very moment when it would be most important for those who oppose an emboldened far-right to speak with confidence and conviction, these same values are losing their luster among significant parts of the left. Companies and cultural institutions <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/stop-firing-innocent/613615/">fire innocent people</a> for imaginary offenses; prominent voices alternate between defending cancel culture and denying its existence; and an astonishing number of academics and journalists proudly proclaim that it is time to abandon values like due process and free speech.</p><p>It would be easy, and not altogether wrong, to point the finger of blame for the erosion of democracy at its sworn enemies. But the truth is that part of the reason why these values are vulnerable is that so many of their defenders have themselves fallen short. </p><p>Too often, those of us who are committed to a free society lack convincing answers to pressing political questions, including the persistent disparities of race and class. Too often, those of us who seek to defend democracy against its enemies are deeply enmeshed in an establishment that gives people good reason to rebel against it. And too often, those of us who seek to mount a case for philosophically liberal values do so in an overly apologetic or unimaginative way.</p><p>This is why I have grown convinced that we need to build a new community of thinkers, activists, and citizens that is committed to defending and reinvigorating the values of a free and fair society.

<p>We are holding a competition on sample-efficient reinforcement learning using human priors. Standard methods require 
months to years of game time to attain human performance in complex games such as Go and StarCraft. In our competition,
 participants develop a system to obtain a diamond in Minecraft using only four days of training time.

<p>The MineRL competition offeres a set of Gym environments paired with human demonstrations to provide participants with
the ability to tackle the difficult Minecraft sample efficiently. This year we are introducing a new 
vectorized action and observation space that obscures the agent’s actions to prevent participants from using domain
knowlege to solve the ObtainDiamond task!</p>

<h3> The Task: Obtain Diamond in Minecraft </h3>

<p>Minecraft is a 3D, first-person, open-world game centered around the gathering of resources and creation of structures and items. These structures and items have prerequisite tools and materials required for their creation. As a result, many items require the completion of a series of natural subtasks.</p>

<p>The procedurally generated world is composed of discrete blocks that allow modification. Over the course of gameplay, players change their surroundings by gathering resources and constructing structures.</p>

<p>In this competition, the goal is to obtain a diamond. The agent begins in a random starting location without any items, and receives rewards for obtaining items which are prerequisites for diamond.</p>

I found myself at a hotel with some friends. I was visiting Portland for a conference. Puppet’s first investment round — and mine! — was closing. The money was being deposited.</p>
<p>Have you seen a David Mamet movie, like <em>The Spanish Prisoner</em>? They’re fantastic. But eerie. Disquieting. They build up a story, brick by brick. Then they yank a few bricks away, exposing the whole story as a lie. Only a hollow truth remains, unrelated to your built up belief. It makes you question everything.</p>
<p>I’m waiting for the closing in this hotel, and I order a Macallan 18 to celebrate. This was back when it was only expensive, not egregious. I lift the glass, and I think:</p>
<p>The money is being deposited into my bank.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> it’s a real bank.</p>
<p>I mean, they had, like, a website. And websites are pretty hard to… <em>wait a minute</em>.</p>
<p>Who introduced me to the bank?</p>
<p>The investors introduced me. They specifically wanted me to work with this bank. They’re the ones giving me the money. They wouldn’t say they’re giving me the money then give it to someone else. That’s a silly kind of fraud. I just have to trust them.</p>
<p>I sit there. Sipping my whiskey.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> it’s a real bank.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> I’m getting $2.25 million.</p>
<p>I had never seen a bank account with that many zeroes — and I still may not at that point! I have no idea what to do.</p>
<p>So I sit there. Savoring that delicious, delicious whiskey.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to raise money. I was just focused on running the company. We had bootstrapped for almost four and a half years. I figured we were going it alone.</p>
<p>I had talked to people in the past about raising money. It was like <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/04/18/groucho-resigns/">Groucho Marx’s joke</a> about clubs: I wouldn’t take money from the investors willing to give it to me. “Wow, I would love them as an investor,” you get nothing. Or, “I would happily give you money and ruin your life.” Hmm. Not really the deal I’m looking for.</p>
<p>One day at an event, an investor tracked me down. He said, I’d like to invest in your company.  I said, That doesn’t sound right. A lot of investors say, We should talk. He said: We should talk <em>on Monday</em>. That specificity made all the difference.</p>
<p>He made a very confusing offer: We would like to write a $1.75 million check into a $2 million round. I said, how can you be that bad at math and work in finance. He said, Go find other, rich people that you know to give you the rest of the money. I said, you are, literally, the only rich person I know. He said, I just joined this firm. I am not rich. Then we’re stuck, I said.</p>
<p>I lived in Nashville at the time. There are a bunch of rich people there. But they’re all musicians. They don’t do technology. We most emphatically did not hang out. We weren’t going to fill this round through my network.</p>
<p>Eventually, by connecting me to their network of rich people, I was able to raise $2.25 million. Mostly through luck not skill. I didn’t build a deck. I didn’t run a formal process. I didn’t pitch multiple investors to get competitive term sheets. I pretty much did the exact opposite of <a href="https://www.venionaire.com/fundraising-playbook/">the play book</a>. The investor who filled out the round turned me down at first, but I heard his wife persuaded him. I don’t know if she liked me or was cursing him.</p>
<p>Once all of the investors are in place, you wait.</p>
<p>The things you learn in your first round.</p>
<p>Closing takes about thirty days. Five rounds later, I have no idea why. It takes thirty days, and it costs $30,000. One of the terms in the term sheet you get from your investors states that you pay for closing. “We’re going to give you this money, and then you’re going to give some of it to the lawyers.” Investors cap the fees, and the lawyers <em>coincidentally</em> hit that exact number every time.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know what the lawyers do at closing. The documents are massively long, but they’re pretty much the same. At a late-stage company, I can understand: There is diligence to do (although not by the lawyers), financial data to look through (done by analysts, not lawyers), customers to talk to (by the investors, not the lawyers). At an early stage, though, there just isn’t much information. I don’t know what they do.</p>
<p>But it takes thirty days. And costs thirty grand. Says so on the term sheet.</p>
<p>So you wait.</p>
<p>But when that waiting stopped, boy howdy did things move.</p>
<p>The money did get deposited. It was a real bank after all.</p>
<p>Within a month I’d moved from Nashville to Portland. Within two months, I had my next three employees. And within six months I had a team of ten.</p>
<p>Raising money set us off like a rocket. Bootstrapping for more than four years provided a fantastic foundation for quick growth.</p>
<p>Looking back, I’m glad we raised money. I only wish we had done it earlier.</p>

Let’s dive in:</p><h3 id="1-use-2nd-gen-convenience-images-for-quick-environment-spin-up">1. Use 2nd gen convenience images for quick environment spin up</h3><p>The “Spin Up Environment” step is responsible for creating the virtual environment in which your job will execute (hence “executor”). Pulling in an executor, in this example an entire Docker image, can be slow. Although you can specify a custom Docker image, CircleCI also provides <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/#next-generation-convenience-images">pre-made convenience images</a> that we have found to be very convenient.</p><p>CircleCI recently released a second-generation version of these convenience images, which promise faster spin-up times. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/cimg-base/blob/master/Dockerfile.template">cimg-base repository</a> documents everything that is installed in the base Docker Image. Because the convenience images are all built off of the same base image, they can cache very well <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-build-a-docker-image-on-circleci-2-0/">using Docker Layer Caching</a>.</p><p>In our example, the only change we need to make is to point to one of these new images in our <code>executors</code>. In our case, we can also remove our credentials used to access our private image:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>executors:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>   ci-node:</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>     docker:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>-     - image: 123456789.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ci-node:our5ha</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+     - image: cimg/node:14.3</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span> </span></p><p><span>7</span><span> workflows:</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>   main_workflow:</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>     jobs:</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+      - jest-unit</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>-      - jest-unit:</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>-         # Give this job AWS credentials to access our private Docker images</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>-         context: dev-ctx</span></p></pre></div><p>The results are pretty dramatic when the cache hits:</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/4ramSJxcaUSP3OekcYBkRK/9fac31c12fdcd24b12a2a0a66056c72e/1j-4V-pGdkkTL6bRMc4LkeRZqINrhDWebZzn8j9E.png" alt="CircleCI: with cache hits."></p></div><p>Even when the cache doesn’t hit, there are usually enough layers cached that spinning up the environment now takes less than 15 seconds (down from 30-50 seconds before).</p><p>Even more helpful than this speed, the new convenience images are Debian-based. This allows us to use Unix tools that our developers are familiar with, like the package manager <code>apt</code>, instead of the sometimes-confusing Alpine <code>apk</code> (Alpine does not include common tools like <code>bash</code> or <code>jq</code> by default).</p><h3 id="2-use-shallow-clones-for-swift-code-checkout">2. Use shallow clones for swift code checkout</h3><p>Repositories balloon over time, especially if you use a monorepo as we do. Even if the file size at HEAD is kept relatively small, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5613345/how-to-shrink-the-git-folder">past file blobs can stick around in the .git folder</a>. One of the best ways to speed up <code>git clone</code> commands is to use a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-beyond-basics-using-shallow-clones">shallow checkout</a>.</p><p>There are a few open-source <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/">CircleCI Orbs</a> that make this optimization easy to implement. In particular, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/guitarrapc/git-shallow-clone">we like this one</a> because it lets us customize any git settings we’d like.</p><p>To use this orb, at the top of your config, add:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>orbs</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>git-shallow-clone</span><span>:</span><span> guitarrapc/git</span><span>-</span><span>shallow</span><span>-</span><span>clone@2.0.3</span></p></pre></div><p>Then replace <code>- checkout</code> in all your jobs with <code>- git-shallow-clone/checkout</code>.</p><p>When we made this change, our checkout step dropped from 15-25 seconds down to 3-5 seconds just like that!</p><p>It’s worth noting that there are two reasons why someone might <em>not</em> use shallow checkouts:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Some Git commands are not supported by shallow checkouts.</strong>
These include fetching information from multiple branches or from deep in the Git history.</p></li><li><p><strong>Git providers sometimes rate limit shallow checkouts.</strong>
This only becomes an issue for large workflows or frequent runs.</p></li></ol><p>That said, for the majority of use cases, shallow checkouts are safe to use and can save a significant amount of time.</p><h3 id="3-untar-in-ram-for-rapid-cache-restores">3. Untar in RAM for rapid cache restores</h3><p>Caching <em>can</em> be a wonderful, run-time-saving thing. That said, accessing our large <code>node_modules</code> folder (nearly 300MB) from the CircleCI cache could sometimes take longer than starting from scratch with a fresh <code>yarn install</code>.</p><p>Internally, CircleCI manages caches and workspaces by putting files into a tarball and uploading that compressed tar file into Amazon S3. When you request a cache, CircleCI downloads the tar file from S3, validates that the file is the one that was requested, and then untars it.</p><p>Because <code>node_modules</code> can have thousands of files, even with lightning-fast network speeds, disk IO can slow down the untar process significantly.</p><p>In our example, restoring our cache took 1:07. Only 6 of those seconds were spent downloading and validating, while decompressing the files took over a minute. In the worst-case scenario, this cache restore step could take up to 3 minutes to complete.</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/6Jtu3bfEugHoXeUokHzzag/d747dd8b395c2fa20910eb5fb2c69538/1i1ZdxE38xmjY57AFoLK9hvEqWZ_fshqhPd6_gCI.png" alt="CircleCI: Untar in RAM."></p></div><p>Lucky for all of us, as of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/changelog#ram-disks">April 7th, 2020 CircleCI release</a>, CircleCI supports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#ram-disks">mounted RAM disks</a> on Docker executors.</p><p>Using these RAM disks has dropped the <code>restore_cache</code> run time down to a consistent 10–20 seconds.

While the larger <code>resource_class</code> costs more money, because our jobs now finish in about half the time, the cost difference has been negligible.</p><p>And while your mileage may vary, give larger instance sizes a try and see if they work for your use case.</p><h3 id="4-parallelize-jobs-for-expedited-workflows">4. Parallelize jobs for expedited workflows</h3><p>Improved caching and access to caches is all very well and good, but when dependencies change, caches need to be updated. In these cases, the <code>yarn install</code> step will need to do more work, as well as the <code>Saving Cache</code> step, adding an extra minute or so to our pipelines. To solve this problem, we decided to play around with parallelization.</p><p>First, we tried saving the cache in a single job separate from all of our other jobs. Each subsequent job could then restore the cache from its saved location in the workspace instead of saving the cache as part of all of our jobs, including the jest tests:</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/Uraphwbv2Qr5ch8w5Dc3g/cc782477babf02e39560d899b75a97c7/Before.svg" alt="CircleCI: before restore cache."></p></div><p>Became</p><div>

It could take almost 2 minutes to store our dependencies in the workspace, and that step needed to complete before we started our jest job.</p><p>To get around this problem, we changed the way we split our jobs. We divided them into first-level jobs that can rely on the global cache for dependencies (and don’t depend on the completion of other jobs) and everything else. Then we added a new first-level job, <code>cache-deps</code>, that cached all dependencies for any job that ran after the first level.</p><p>Our new pipeline runs all first-level jobs immediately, and then anything with a dependency. This division has the added benefit that most of our first-level jobs no longer need to write out to the cache, as <code>cache-deps</code> now takes care of that.</p><p>In our config, this looks like:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>+  cache-deps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>+    parameters:</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>+      key:</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+        type: string</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span><span>+    executor: ci-node</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>+    steps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>+      - git-shallow-clone/checkout</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>+      - restore_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+          keys:</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>+            - &lt;&lt; parameters.key &gt;&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>+      - run: yarn install</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>+      - save_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>+          paths:</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span><span>+            - node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/admin-dashboard/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/core/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span><span>+            - ...</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>+      …</span></p></pre></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A while ago, Alex Lo from the South China Morning Post kindly quoted me in one of his columns, and I am happy to return the favour. In his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3090798/must-united-states-demonise-china">piece</a>&nbsp;last week, Lo raised an interesting aspect. America has always needed an enemy, or so he put it, and China was but the latest in a long series of “monsters” in need of destruction. His introductory quote of John Adams, the 6th US president, warning against such behaviour had long been dismissed and become a blueprint for America’s engagement in the world.</p>

<p>Lo goes on saying that every post-War president, including Donald Trump, went into office trying to heed Adams’ wise advice but ended up doing the opposite. We can see the temptation. When your military is deployed in more than 150 countries in a world that has fewer than 200, one may claim not to run an empire, and America has obviously not done that in the textbook sense of it, but according to Lo it obviously becomes harder to justify your presence regardless what fanciful claims you make.</p>

<p>When you have a democracy, public opinion must be managed or, in some cases, even manufactured. And these days, America seems to be in the business of demonising China to do just that and deflect from domestic issues. Lo thinks that simply existing as a rising power, such as China, is enough to make someone an enemy, which must be isolated, demonised, contained, if not destroyed. How Washington has tried to use Hong Kong as a pressure point and factor in this hegemonic calculus is remarkable.</p>

<p>But here it comes what Lo is saying that absolutely resonates… Creating an enemy requires the opposing entity to behave like one or declare itself as one. The issue with this is, does China want to be America’s enemy? From the evidence of China’s actions and reactions, one wouldn’t get the impression. Despite the poking and provoking of Trump’s vassals as well as the entire Washington establishment itself Beijing hasn’t exactly taken the bait and manoeuvred skillfully across the minefield.</p>

<p>Isolating China as Mike Pompeo trumpets to be America’s foremost policy is easier said than done on a globe of many stakeholders. It would inevitably mean some sort of a Cold War, but China can’t be compared to the Soviet Union in any respect. Who would assemble to constitute one bloc versus the other? Washington by way of modern-day mantras such as America First doesn’t seem to be able to recruit an incremental number of countries to form a bloc.</p>

<p>To be sure, there are a few allies that would go out of their way to walk in step with America. A die-hard one these days appears to be Australia that under their current government seems to have sold their soul to America’s cause of having an enemy, or otherwise called the Indo-Pacific initiative. There may be others, but they haven’t come forward as carrying Washington’s water. Apart from possibly the UK, forget about Europe. India more and more seems inclined to play ball, but don’t bet on it.</p>

<p>On the flip side, China isn’t even interested in forming a bloc, and it may not need to in the first place. As long as Beijing’s trading partners behave in the context of an open and multilateral word order, why have a bloc? Readers may think I forgot Japan and South Korea as US allies in Indo-Pacific. I wouldn’t be too sure about that. Tokyo and Seoul have been careful not to provoke Beijing, much as the ASEAN countries will not be lured into taking sides. Trade and regional integration are top on their minds.</p>

<p>Europe is developing a similar mindset gradually and under the duress of Trump’s bullying. Never mind what formal condemnations echo from Brussels with regards to China’s presence and actions. The reality is that China’s economy has been least impacted by the health crisis, and who wouldn’t want to partner with the top dog in global business, for maybe years to come. Pragmatism against the backdrop of a sole superpower in relative decline seems to be the motto going forward.</p>

<p>While Trump and Joe Biden are busy greasing their propaganda machines and attempt to outperform each other bashing China, as they have little else to show for but the declared enemy, vast parts of the rest of the world are moving on. It’d be too nonchalant to claim that all is business as usual for the Chinese, but apart from building its own mouthpieces on social media the Beijing leadership has distinctly avoided direct confrontation with mostly Pompeo’s attack tirades.</p>

<p>Instead, the moves from Beijing have been a lot more subtle, such as leaving no doubt about the territorial integrity of China, rushing its contingency plans in response to US tech bans, building on its alliance with Russia, schmoozing European countries into commercial partnerships, veering trade away from America to ASEAN, cultivating a more constructive relationship with Japan and Korea, and stubbornly pursuing the generational Belt and Road and the commensurate expansion of its ecosystem.</p>

<p>If you think about it, no sane person would call any of these actions outright anti-American, apart from the American government itself of course. Anything and everything Beijing does, as a matter of the country’s existential needs or as a reaction to any bullying, is deemed a provocation on Washington’s end. It’s not even a question of chicken and egg. This is what propaganda is and does. It creates a narrative that the masses and stakeholders are being spoon-fed, no matter how much truth there is.</p>

<p>China doesn’t want conflict. Why would it? Neither is it in any danger of trying to become an imperial power and take over the world as some mainstream media have insinuated. All China wants is to further its country and people, a legitimate quest. Naturally, its growth changes the global equation, and that is being perceived as a threat. But is China an enemy by definition? Well, in the world of one sole superpower it has the potential of becoming one. In a multilateral and -polar world of the future, however, it doesn’t need to be.</p>

<p>In many locations you can get PCBs made fast, cheap, and of very good quality. In Brazil, where Vítor Barbosa lives, this isn’t the case, so he built a&nbsp;“<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/171775-haxmark460-home-pcb-printer">haxmark460</a>” PCB printer&nbsp;to help manufacture circuits at home.</p>
<p> The build modifies a Lexmark E460dn laserjet printer to mark PCBs directly, using an aluminum carrier plate instead of its normal paper feed operation.</p>
<p>An Arduino is utilized to hijack and output printer signals, enabling it to it to work in a much different way than how it was originally designed. The carrier plate, with blank PCB material taped on, is fed into the front and the PCB is pulled through and properly marked by the printer. After a dip in acetone to allow the toner to stick to the copper, the board is ready to etch!</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The first time I encounter a regular expression was many years ago, but I still remember my first thoughts on it:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is this string-like thing?</li>
<li>I rather don’t touch it, looks scary</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t remember quite well what that regex was doing, or how exactly looked like, but it scared me to death. Looking in retrospective I realize that it was probably not scary at all and that in fact, it was an easy way to solve the problem in hand. But why did I got this feeling? It’s just the awkwardness of the syntax, they certainly look strange, and if you don’t know what they are, they look very complicated.</p>
<p>My intention here is not to scare you out, regex can be simple once we understand them, but if you don’t and you look at something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">^\(*\d{3}\)*( |-)*\d{3}( |-)*\d{4}$
</code></pre></div><p>Can be intimidating…</p>
<p>Today we are going to demystify regular expressions, we will see what they are, what they are useful for, and how you can design your regular expressions to solve problems.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-are-regular-expressions">What are regular expressions</h2>
<p>Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in data strings. They have their own syntax, as is they are their own programming language, and there are methods and ways to interact with regular expressions in most (if not all) programming languages.</p>
<p>But what kind of patterns are we talking about? common examples of regular expressions determine for example if a given string is an email address or a phone number, or they can be used to verify if a password fulfills a certain complexity.</p>
<p>Once you have the pattern, what can you do with the regular expressions?</p>
<ul>
<li>validate a string with the pattern</li>
<li>search within a string</li>
<li>replace substrings in a string</li>
<li>extract information from a string</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="working-with-regular-expressions">Working with regular expressions</h2>
<p>For this article, we are going to cover how to work with regular expressions in JavaScript, though the concepts learned here apply to other languages as well. With that said, in other languages, there may be some differences in the way they treat regular expressions.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example that will validate if the string contains the word <code>Hello</code> or not.</p>
<p>In JavaScript there are 2 ways to going about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructor</li>
<li>Literal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructor">Constructor</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> RegExp(<span>'Hello'</span>)
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>regex</span>.<span>test</span>(<span>'Hello World!'</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>result</span>)

<span>--------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>--------------</span>
<span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="literal">Literal</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>/Hello/</span>
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>regex</span>.<span>test</span>(<span>'Hello World!'</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>result</span>)

<span>--------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>--------------</span>
<span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In both scenarios, the variable <code>regex</code> is an object, which exposes different methods we can use to interact with the regular expression. However, the first example has a more familiar look, instancing an object with a <code>string</code> as a parameter. In the second scenario things look a bit weird, there is something that resembles a <code>string</code> but instead of quotes is wrapped in <code>/</code>. As it turns out both ways represent the same, I personally like the second option, which is very clean, and IDEs or code editors can have syntax highlighting on the regular expression compared to the first scenario where the regular expression pattern is defined just as a string.</p>
<p>So far our regular expressions have been fairly simple, is just the exact match on the string <code>Hello</code> and it worked perfectly for JavaScript, however the result we obtained can be different for other languages, even though the regular expression is the same. This is because each programming language can define certain defaults or special behaviors in their regular expressions which can vary from one to another. So sorry about that, but is just how it is. When we build a RegEx, though for the most part will be the same in most programming languages, before you use it somewhere else you will have to test it and adjust it if necessary.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="different-uses-of-regular-expressions">Different uses of regular expressions</h2>
<p>When working with regular expressions we are basically working with the RegExp object methods, or with string methods which allows us to interact with regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regexpprototypetest">RegExp.prototype.test()</h3>
<p>The <code>test()</code> method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Example: Look if the specified string contains the string <code>foo</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>'table football'</span>

<span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> RegExp(<span>'foo'</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>regex</span>.<span>test</span>(<span>str</span>))

<span>-------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>-------------</span>
<span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="regexpprototypeexec">RegExp.prototype.exec()</h3>
<p>The <code>exec()</code> method executes a search for a match in a specified string. Returns a result array, or null.</p>
<p>Example: Look for all the instances of <code>foo</code> in the given string</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>'table football, foosball'</span>
<span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>/foo/g</span>

          <p>My
<a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/improving-risc-v-linux-support-in-rust/">previous blog post</a>
introduced my work to improve <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust's</a> support for
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> Linux systems. Since then I fixed a couple of
interesting compiler bugs. This blog post is more technical - describing these
bugs and explaining some <code>rustc</code> internals along the way. I conclude by
reporting on movement in the broader Rust community regarding RISC-V. I
assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>

<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

				<p><strong>UPDATE 6/25/2020:</strong> The bottom of the post now has a section about using 2D low discrepancy sequences with an alias table and compares results vs the 1D methods.  The code has been updated as well to include that stuff.</p>
<p>In this post we are going to talk about Round Robin first, then Weighted Round Robin.</p>
<p>The ~500 lines of standalone C++ that generated the data for this blog post can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Atrix256/WeightedRR" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Atrix256/WeightedRR</a></p>

<p>Let’s say you find yourself in one of these 2 equivalent scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to repeatedly choose from a list of 10 objects in a fair way, where the objects are chosen at roughly the same rate – like, a loot drop table for killing monsters in a game.</li>
<li>You have 10 queues of work that you want to process work items from in a fair way, where work is consumed from the queues at roughly the same rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case you want a stream of integers between 0 and 9 where ideally any section – large or small – should have roughly even counts of those numbers chosen.  In other words, it should have a flat histogram for both large and small sections.</p>
<p>One way to deal with this is to just walk through the numbers 0 through 9 over and over and over.  You could increment a number whenever you wanted the next index and use modulus to ensure it was between 0 and 9.</p>
<p>I’m calling this “Sequential” in the graphs and that would work, but depending on your usage case, it might be undesirable that it was so obviously going in order from 0 to 9.</p>
<p>Another way to deal with this would be to roll a random integer 0 through 9 and use that as your answer.  In the code, I roll a random float between 0 and 1 and remap that to an integer 0 through 9 so it’s more like the other methods.  I’m calling this “White Noise” in the graphs and that also would work in that the histogram is going to be flat after an infinite number of samples, but it won’t be very flat in small numbers of samples.</p>
<p>Yet another way to deal with this is to use a low discrepancy sequence (deterministic or randomized aka blue noise) such as the golden ratio additive recurrence low discrepancy sequence which looks like this:</p>
<pre title="">float GetNextValue(float x)
{
  float newX = x + 1.61803398875f;
  return newX - floor(newX);
}
</pre>
<p>In the above, the first value you ever plug into this function can be any number.  It can be 0.0, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>1.61803398875 is the golden ratio and since we are dealing with values between 0 and 1, you could also use 0.61803398875 instead which is the fractional part of the golden ratio, but is also 1 divided by the golden ratio (the golden ratio conjugate).</p>
<p>The golden ratio is a good choice here because it’s an irrational number, meaning that from a mathematical point of view (ignoring limitations of computers for a second) it won’t ever repeat values.</p>
<p>The golden ratio is also an excellent choice among irrational numbers because it is the most irrational number.  Less irrational numbers – like pi – still don’t repeat but they have “near repeats” which make them less good of a choice.  Then there are numbers like the square root of 2, which are pretty decently irrational – more than pi, but less than the golden ratio.</p>
<p>An alternate way to write the code is like this, which gives you “random access” to the sequence, but is more prone to having floating point precision issues.</p>
<pre title="">float GetValue(int index, float seed)
{
  float newX = seed + float(index) * 1.61803398875f;
  return newX - floor(newX);
}
</pre>
<p>If you use this in our problem for generating floating point values between 0 and 1 and remapping to integers 0 through 9, you will get fairly even counts of occurrences of those integers (a fairly flat histogram) from both small and large sections of the sequence.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the program generating a sequence of 80 items, using the techniques talked about so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted50.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted50.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>It’s hard to tell what the histogram looks like from that, but it is still a bit interesting looking at the difference in patterns of the numbers chosen.  There are seeming patterns even in the golden ratio because the values are quantized to 10 possible values.</p>
<p>Here are histograms of 100 samples. It shows that white noise is doing noticeably worse than the irrational numbers, but the irrational numbers don’t have a winner that is easy to discern with the naked eye.  Sequential can’t even be seen because it is by definition a completely flat histogram and so is a flat line at y=0.1.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted100.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted100.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms of 10,000 samples. White noise and pi look about the same, but golden ratio and square root of 2 are much closer to the actual flat histogram value / sequential sequence.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted10k.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted10k.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms of 1,000,000 samples. White noise is way worse than everything else, but it’s hard to see a winner from the rest of the group.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1m.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1m.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here we remove white noise from the graph to see the others better. Pi shows being the worst. Square root of two is next, and then the golden ratio which is closest to the sequential / flat histogram line.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1mb.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1mb.png?w=800"></a></p>
<h2>Round Robin vs Random Integers</h2>
<p>When using white noise, round robin is just random integers.  It’s the same as rolling dice.  So what is the difference?</p>
<p>In the last section I say that using a low discrepancy sequence is better than using white noise, because it reaches the target histogram more accurately with fewer samples – fewer rolls of the dice.</p>
<p>The downside to this though is that the numbers are no longer random… a person viewing the sequence of numbers can almost certainly guess what the next number is going to be.</p>
<p>So, that makes it not useful to use these for places where randomization is important – like when gambling or for cryptography.</p>
<p>But, where this is useful is for places where fairness matters but randomness does not.</p>
<p>One example could be pulling work items from a work queue.  Who cares if it is possible to guess which thread is going to get assigned the next item of work?  The important thing is that the work is spread evenly.</p>
<p>Another example is in numerical integration in monte carlo integration, and also other stochastic rendering situations.  This is more what I care about.  In these situations, you don’t care if the choice can be predicted or not, but if you can reduce the amount of error vs the target distribution in fewer samples that means you’ll have less noise in your resulting image, which is ::chef kiss:: oh so great.  A better image for the same processing power.</p>
<p>If you were in a situation that wanted randomness, but you still wanted some of these benefits, you should check out “blue noise”, which is a randomized version of low discrepancy sequences.  A good place to start might be my post on generating blue noise in 2 dimensions, which you could modify to only generate 1 dimensional blue noise and use for this purpose.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/10/20/generating-blue-noise-sample-points-with-mitchells-best-candidate-algorithm/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.demofox.org/2017/10/20/generating-blue-noise-sample-points-with-mitchells-best-candidate-algorithm/</a></p>
<h2>Weighted Round Robin</h2>
<p>Let’s say you find yourself in the same situation as before but now there are weighted probabilities involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the loot drop situation, different loot should be awarded with different probabilities.</li>
<li>For the work queues, you could have different powered CPUs servicing the work queues maybe.  More powerful processors should be more likely to get work served to them perhaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our situation, we’ll say that the weight of item 0 is 1, the weight of item 1 is 2, and so on, up to the weight of item 9 being 10.</p>
<p>Let’s check out our options again.</p>
<p>First, we could go sequentially.  This means that our sequence would go like this: 011222333344444… etc.</p>
<p>A possible issue with this (again, depending on your specific needs) is that it is even, but it goes through every occurrence of a number before moving to the next number.  If it was desired that the numbers be visited in a more interleaved fashion, you’d want to try something else. </p>
<p>The next thing you could try is to take the item weights and divide them by the total of the item weights, so that they add up to 1.0.  This would make them normalized.  From here, we could roll a random floating point number between 0 and 1, find the item that has the range that contains that floating point number, and use that as the selected item.</p>
<p>That would solve the problem I mentioned, but would introduce the problem of white noise: while large sample counts have the right histogram (distribution), small sample counts don’t.</p>
<p>We could also use irrational numbers again, which would do better at reaching the correct histogram than white noise but become deterministic like sequential, but still shuffled “a bit”.</p>
<p>Here’s the program output for 80 item sequences of the various techniques:<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted80.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted80.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms with 100 samples. The irrationals are all doing pretty well. White noise is not doing great. Strangely, sequential is also not doing real great for the last value because the sequence length doesn’t divide 100 evenly this time!<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted100.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted100.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms with 10,000 samples.  It’s harder to see for sure who is winning by nature of the graph, compared to the last section, but we can see white noise is not doing great.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted10k.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted10k.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms with 1,000,000 samples. It’s nearly impossible to see anything about it.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1m.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1m.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here is the graph of subtracting sequential from the others.  It shows that white noise is by far the worst.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mb.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mb.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Removing white noise from that graph, we can see that pi is worst, golden ratio is best, and square root of 2 isn’t far behind the golden ratio.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mc.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mc.png?w=800"></a></p>

<p>If you look at the code, you might be saying to yourself that the weighted version isn’t great because you need a loop to convert the 1D floating point value in [0,1] to the weighted item chosen.  If you switched to using an alias table, it’d be an O(1) constant time operation, but then the 1D value would not be enough – you’d need a 1d value and a biased coin flip.  AKA just a 2d value that is [0,1] on each axis.  It would be interesting to compare an alias table / 2D LDS sequence to see how it converged versus this method.  I really, really, should have done …</p></div></div>

Jeff Bezos sums this up in one elegant quote:</p><blockquote>You can build a business strategy around the things <strong>that are stable in time</strong>. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, “Jeff I love Amazon, I just wish the prices were a little higher.” Or, “I love Amazon, I just wish you’d deliver a little slower.” Impossible.<p>So we know the energy we put into these things today will still be paying off dividends 10 years from now. <strong>When you have something you know is true, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.<p>‍</p></strong>— Jeff Bezos</p></blockquote><p>Riffing from there, I thought it prudent to come up with my own, evolving list of permanent assumptions. The exercise itself is one of enormous introspection and as such I couldn't recommend it enough. Enjoy, and I'd love to see yours as well!</p><ol role="list"><li>Most people, consciously or unconsciously, lie to themselves constantly to fit a self image from which they derive benefit.</li><li>Stories shape everything around us and form the loose fabric of reality.

The search itself is pursuit as happiness.</li><li>Happiness is not the goal and is not guaranteed. The point of life is not to be happy, the point of life is to feel fulfilled — to seek ferociously while being content where you are.</li><li>Knowledge is useless without context.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Redbug is safe to be used in production, thanks to a self-protecting
mechanism against overload, which kills the tool in case too many
tracing messages are sent, preventing the Erlang node to become
overloaded. Let’s see it in action:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>$ </span><span>erl</span>
<span>Erlang</span><span>/</span><span>OTP</span> <span>19</span> <span>[</span><span>erts</span><span>-</span><span>8</span><span>.</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[...]</span>

</div>
</div><p>Let’s now look at the actual message produced by redbug. By default
messages are printed to the standard output, but it’s also possible to
dump them to file:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>% 15:20:20 &lt;0.31.0&gt;({erlang,apply,2})
</span><span>%</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>])</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Depending on the version of redbug you are using, you may get a
slightly different message. In this case, the message is split across
two lines. The first line contains a <strong>timestamp</strong>, the <strong>Process Identifier</strong>
(or <em>PID</em>) of the Erlang process which invoked the function and the
<strong>caller</strong> function. The second line contains the function called,
including the input arguments. Both lines are prepended with a <code>%</code>,
which reminds us of the syntax for Erlang comments.</p><p>We can also ask Redbug to produce an extra message for the return
value. This is achieved using the following syntax:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>4</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>redbug</span><span>:</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>"lists:sort/1-&gt;return"</span><span>).</span>
<span>{</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Let’s invoke the <code>lists:sort/1</code> function again. This time the output
from redbug is slightly different.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>5</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>]).</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>

<span>% 15:35:52 &lt;0.31.0&gt;({erlang,apply,2})
% lists:sort([3,2,1])
</span>
<span>% 15:35:52 &lt;0.31.0&gt;({erlang,apply,2})
% lists:sort/1 -&gt; [1,2,3]
</span><span>redbug</span> <span>done</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>In this case two messages are produced, one when entering the function
and one when leaving the same function.</p><p>When dealing with real code, trace messages can be complex and
therefore hardly readable. Let’s see what happens if we try to trace
the sorting of a list containing 10.000 elements.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>6</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>seq</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)).</span>

</div><p>Most of the output has been truncated here, but you should get the
idea. To improve things, we can use a couple of redbug options.  The
option <code>{arity, true}</code> instructs redbug to only display the number of
input arguments for the given function, instead of their actual
value. The <code>{print_return, false}</code> option tells Redbug not to display
the return value of the function call, and to display a <code>…​</code>  symbol,
instead. Let’s see these options in action.</p><div>

</div><p>By default, redbug stops after 15 seconds or after 10 messages are
received. Those values are a safe default, but they are rarely

options. <code>time</code> is expressed in milliseconds.</p><div>

</div>
</div><p>Last but not least, redbug offers the ability to only display results
for matching input arguments. This is when the syntax looks a bit like
magic.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>12</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>redbug</span><span>:</span><span>start</span><span>([</span><span>"lists:sort([1,2,5])-&gt;return"</span><span>]).</span>

</div>
</div><p>In the above example, we are telling redbug that we are only
interested in function calls to the <code>lists:sort/1</code> function when the
input arguments is the list <code>[1,2,5]</code>. This allows us to remove a huge
amount of noise in the case our target function is used by many actors
at the same time and we are only interested in a specific use case.
Oh, and don’t forget that you can use the underscore as a wildcard:</p><div>

<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of it’s mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div v-pre="">
        <p>I've been offline (blog wise) for nearly 3 months now - <a href="https://sarfas.codes/blog/laravel-route-model-binding/">in fact my last post was on April 12th!</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of that has come down to me moving house, COVID-19 messing with my working schedule, and some other things I've been working out in the background. The main thing that's changed here is; <strong>I'm now self-employed</strong></p>

<p>Having taken on some large projects at my main job, I had to cut back on my side-projects and contracting work in the evenings. This was to keep me from burning out as I was working too much.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Coronavirus days, and I found myself missing the contracting work. I loved working from home, and being able to structure the freelance hours around my own schedule. So I decided I was going to take this on full time, and pack in my dayjob.</p>
<p>I left my last PAYE ("normal job") role 3 weeks ago now, and have been working full time on <a href="https://cleveregg.io/">CleverEgg Digital</a> with a close group of clients.</p>

<p>For me, the main positive is controlling my own hours.</p>
<p>If I want to take a day off - I just do it. Yes, I'm not earning money that day, so I need to catch it up; but the option is there if I need it. There's no HR process, no holiday bookings, nothing. I take a day, when I like.</p>
<p>The hours. I'm most efficient after midday. Due to this, most of my contract work is done between the hours of 11am and 7pm. This gives me the freedom to do whatever I like in the mornings, and still have a late night if I like - I don't have to get up for work early ⏰</p>

<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>
<p>If you're considering doing this, you need to be your own worst critic and be strict on your time. Time is literally money in the contracting world.</p>
<p>You don't have a boss staring down you 24/7. Or checking up on your progress everyday. If you wanna earn some money, do it off your own back.</p>
<p>Once you get a few clients, the thought of invoices being settled will be a good motivator - so that's always a bonus.</p>
<p>I've found that working for yourself means you do need to know a little more than just "your trade". Here's a few I can mention off the top of my head;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Accounting,</li>
<li>Fundamentals of understanding Contracts, Terms, and negotiation thereof,</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a developer by trade, yet I've had to use all of the above 3 in the last 24 hours. Naturally I could pay someone to do all of them; but I'm not in any financial position to do so.</p>

<p>I should have done this sooner! I'm far happier in my work, as well as in a better position with my mental health.</p>
<p>I thought I'd be working longer hours to chase the extra money - given I can do so. However, I actually work less than I did with my "standard job"; and I'm no worse off financially.</p>

<p>Freelance/Contracting isn't for everyone. Clients are very hard to come by, especially in today's economy and situations. I've been extremely lucky in that I've found a handful of clients who are well backed financially, and are unaffected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>I cannot express how much I owe of this to the <a href="https://laravelphp.uk/">LaravelUK</a> community. Both in sourcing/sharing clients, and giving me support and advice for the last 2 years whilst I ponder over this decision.</p>
<p>If you do take the plunge and go into this chaos, here's a few tips;</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a community of like-minded people within your industry</li>
<li>Ensure that you have enough money that you can go without work for a bit
<ul>
<li><em>You won't be getting sick pay, or Annual Leave</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't under charge. Cheaper clients are cheap for a reason. Those that want your time, respect your trade, and want to look after you will pay for it.</li>
<li>Be confident in your work; but not complacent / arrogant</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy it. Being your own boss is awesome!</strong></li>
</ul>    </div></div>]]>

  <p>Discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23717878">Hacker News</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the coronavirus shortening my work commute into a walk down the hall, I’ve been able to read more in the mornings. Now that I’ve been gifted more time in the day, I am finishing about a book a week (I’m privileged to have at least an hour a day for reading, and that time quickly adds up). It has been amazing to return to my teenage reading habits when my parents feigned exasperation at my perpetual nose-in-book lifestyle - “is that kid reading again?”. In these tumultuous times, books have also been a welcome respite (well-documented positive effects of reading on mental well-being probably don’t hurt).</p>

<p>Reading more, I couldn’t help but notice book reviews everywhere. Inspired, I wrote <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-30-solaris.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-21-the-man-who-solved-the-market-how-jim-simons-launched-the-quant-revolution.html">few</a>, but found myself asking what I wanted to get out of the creative energy I was channeling into them (after all, I’m not a professional book-review-writer and my time is limited). In order to think clearly about the topic, I sought inspiration in the work of other writers.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-other-writers-approach-book-reviews">How do other writers approach book reviews?</h2>

<p>With the question “how should I write about what I’ve been reading?” in mind, I started compiling examples of book reviews and categorizing them by style:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Persuasive reviews</strong>: I bucket reviews <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/books/review-night-boat-tangier-kevin-barry.html">like those</a> from the NYTimes into this category. Even though the author of the inevitably informs you about the book’s content, they’re advocating that their readers purchase the book (or don’t purchase the book in some case). Frequently the review also gives a background on the book’s literary lineage.</li>
  <li><strong>Summary reviews</strong>: Products like <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/library/">Blinkist</a> or <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes/antifragile">Nat Eliason’s book reviews</a> fall into this category. I think there’s a place for summarization-style reviews of non-fiction <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/#branchbooks">“branch books”</a> - if one were to imagine knowledge as a tree, “branch books” typically cover a single topic on the edge of the tree, rather than attempting to be a wide-reaching, foundational tome of a subject area.</li>
  <li><strong>Thematic reviews</strong>: The New York Review of Books <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/07/02/what-is-college-worth/">often</a> <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/11/07/heritage-of-evil/">combines</a> discussion of several books into a general overview of a topic. This approach is well-suited to academics or subject-matter experts who have the time (and intellectual stamina!) to read a variety of books connected to a common thread.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep-dive reviews:</strong> Slate Star Codex was (while I was writing this, the takedown of the blog happened) an <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/">example</a> of this category, with <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/">opinionated book reviews</a> that form connections between the author’s well-formed thoughts and the subject matter at hand. They’re often witty and summarize the content as needed while weaving it into a story.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a general overview of possible styles loaded into my memory, I switched to thinking about what I was hoping to get out of the process.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want-to-get-out-of-book-reviews">What do I want to get out of book reviews?</h2>

<p>After consuming diverse, different review styles, I realized that I could reduce my motivation for reviewing books to two goals: retention of what I learned (in the case of non-fiction) books and writing something other people enjoy reading.</p>

<p>Thankfully there is a large body of knowledge about how to accomplish the first goal using <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a>.</p>

<p>Spaced repetition is also called SRS, and there are many sources about how to use the system to increase retention:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://robertheaton.com/">Rob Heaton’s</a> blog post on <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/">How to read</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting long term memory</a> discusses using Anki for deep reviews</li>
  <li>A (sic) Hahvahd Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week">article</a> about retention and understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, making book reviews enjoyable for other people is a more difficult problem, and the best path is being inspired by others. If you find a great review <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/2020/06/13/micah.lerner@hey.com">send it my way</a>!</p>

While statelessness has a lot of benefits, it’s unfortunately rarely possible in the real world. In this post, I’d like to detail this stance of mine a bit.</p> <div> <h2 id="state-in-functional-programming">State in Functional Programming</h2> <div> <p>Functional Programming is based on a set of principles. Among those principles are <em>pure</em> functions:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>A pure function is a function that has the following properties:</p> <ol><li><span>Its return value is the same for the same arguments</span></li><li><span>Its evaluation has no side effects</span></li></ol> </blockquote>  </div> <p>For example, the following function is <em>pure</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>int</span> <span>timesTwo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>A <em>pure</em> function allows <em>referential transparency</em>: the swapping of then function with its return value. With that in mind, the introduction of state may defeat the previous definition. For example, the following breaks <em>referential transparency</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>Multiplier</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>private</span> <span>int</span> <span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>times</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>The above implementation is <em>immutable</em>: state is set once when the object is created, and cannot be changed afterwards. Successive calls with the same argument will return the same result over and over. Yet, the method has side-effects.</p> <p>To keep most of the system <em>pure</em>, practitioners of <abbr title="Functional Programming">FP</abbr> push non-pure functions to the system boundaries.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-web-architectures">State in web architectures</h2> <div> <p>The HTTP protocol is stateless. The benefit is obvious: when a request hits the load-balancer, the latter can forward it to any web server that belongs to the cluster, and that hosts the requested resource. This allows for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_or_Scale_Out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horizontal scaling</a>. When the load increases, it’s straightforward to add more nodes until the performance becomes acceptable again. It works like a charm, until the requirement goes beyond just displaying static pages.</p> <p>In reality, a lot of use-cases require different HTTP requests to be recognized as originating from the same "session": authentication, e-commerce caddies, etc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookies</a> are the browsers' answer to those requirements.</p> <p>Servers do offer a generic storage mechanism, keyed to a session identifier. On the first request, the server adds a cookie with a specific session id to the response. Subsequent requests will use this cookie, so the server associates the request with the same session. Different servers have different cookies: <code>JSESSIONID</code> for Java EE, <code>PHPSESSID</code> for PHP, <code>ASPSESSIONID</code> for ASP, etc.</p> <p>Data stored on a specific cluster node won’t obviously be accessible to requests forwarded to other nodes, even when they originate from the same session. To avoid that, sessions needs to be "pinned down" on the node that received the first request for that session. In standard web architectures, this is one of the responsibility of the load-balancer: it keeps the association between a session id and the node in memory. This feature is known as <em>sticky sessions</em>.</p> <p>However, nodes will sometimes fail. If session data is on that node, it will be lost. To compensate for that, data needs to be replicated on other nodes. That capability is known as <em>session replication</em>.</p> <p>Sticky sessions, and even more so sessions replication, make architectures stateful.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-rest-architectures">State in REST architectures</h2> <div>  <ol><li><span>Client-server architecture</span></li><li><span>Statelessness</span></li><li><span>Cacheability</span></li><li><span>Layered system</span></li><li><span>Uniform interface</span></li></ol> <p>Note that #2 explicitly defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Statelessness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statelessness</a> as a requirement of the REST architecture. However, the definition of it in this context is not the absence of state, but that state shouldn’t be stored server-side.</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>The client-server communication is constrained by no client context being stored on the server between requests. Each request from any client contains all the information necessary to service the request, and the session state is held in the client. The session state can be transferred by the server to another service such as a database to maintain a persistent state for a period and allow authentication.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>The quote above defines two options to store data:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>In a database</dt> <dd> <p>Storing data is the <em>raison d’être</em> for databases, whether SQL or NoSQL. Hence, it seems like an obvious choice to store state. However, this generally implies <em>disk-based persistence</em>. In turn, this means increased access time to data, 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than for in-memory access.</p> </dd> <dt>On the client</dt> <dd> <p>Another option is to store data as cookies. This approach raises some interesting challenges on its own: the first one is about security. If credentials-related data is stored client-side, then how can the server guarantees they are genuine? The currently agreed-upon answer is <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON Web Tokens</a>. One just needs to remember it makes the flow more complex, and slower, because validation still needs to occur server-side, prior to any further request handling.</p> <p>The second challenge revolves around data serialization. Simple types <em>e.g.</em> <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> can easily be set in cookie values, but what about more complex types? It would require an serialization/deserialization mechanism: when the request is received, cookies should be deserialized into objects, and when the response is sent, objects should be serialized back into a compatible format <em>e.g.</em> JSON.</p> <p>The complete setup is worth a dedicated post, but here are some points that deserve some attention:</p> <ul><li><span>How to manage serialization limitations?</span></li><li><span>The need to automate the serialization/deserialization flow</span></li><li><span>Configure the entities to be serialized, and decide which JSON library to use</span></li></ul> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-kubernetes">State in Kubernetes</h2> <div> <p>First, one should remember that Kubernetes was originally focused on stateless workloads. For example, <code>StatefulSet</code> was introduced in version 1.5 as a beta feature. Furthermore, rolling upgrades of the <code>Deployment</code> object handle pods only. If containerized applications use a database, and software require different schema versions, you’re on your own: while possible, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvCnrBZ0DPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not trivial</a>.</p> <p>Apart from that, Kubernetes offers some interesting options to manage state:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Inside the container</dt> <dd> <p>The easiest way to store data is to use the container’s topmost layer. This is the case when one uses one of the filesystem unmapped directories <em>e.g.</em> <code>/var/log</code>.

	<div>
		
<p>A while ago I decided to delete my ‘like’ history on Twitter.</p>



<p>Since then, I’ve discovered interesting ways in which Twitter’s engineering makes it impossible to do.</p>



<p>The recent ones are easy, if you have access to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter API</a>. You can request the list of ‘favorites’ (they never renamed them to ‘likes’ on the API layer) and from there you can <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-favorites-destroy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delete them</a>, one at a time.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import twitter

api = twitter.Api(
    os.environ['CONSUMER_KEY'], os.environ['CONSUMER_SECRET'],
    os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY'], os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'],
    sleep_on_rate_limit=True
)
while True:
    favorites = api.GetFavorites(count=200)
    if not favorites:
        break
    print(f"GetFavorites(): Received {len(favorites)} status objects.")
    for status in favorites:
        print(f"{status.user.screen_name:20}: {status.text}")
        status = api.DestroyFavorite(status_id=status.id)
</code></pre>



<p>From the looks of things, you can delete the most recent 3,000 or so ‘likes’ you’ve ever made using a script like this.</p>



<p>After that, things get harder.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve been thinking about what a ‘like’ on Twitter and Facebook means.</p>



<p>When you click it, you’re sending a single piece of information to the person who wrote the tweet. Ostensibly, I guess, that you liked their tweet. Really it’s just read-receipt for Twitter — you’re just telling someone that you read what they wrote. If you’re mentioned in a tweet it seems almost <em>fait accompli</em> that you’re going to hit ‘like’. It means “yeah yeah, I got your message”, and not much else.</p>



<p>After that, it just sits there, in your history, and in Twitter’s database. It becomes part of their algorithm to tune your feed to keep you hooked.</p>



<hr>



<p>Once you’ve deleted all the ‘likes’ that the API will allow you to see, you’ll find, to your surprise, that there are still thousands to go. They show up on your ‘likes’ page, and they show up in your exported data archive, but the little red ‘heart’ isn’t active.</p>



<p>I guess these ‘likes’ are in some sort of static cold storage. I’d be fascinated to hear from a Twitter engineer (a) how it works, and (b) why they still work for Twitter.</p>



<p>You can’t delete them, the platform doesn’t treat them as ‘liked’ tweets at all.</p>



<p>The only way to get rid of them is to is to click the heart twice: to ‘like’ it anew and then ‘unlike’ it. This sends the author  and anyone mentioned a fresh notification telling them that you liked their tweet.</p>



<p>If you want to delete your old history of tweets. You’re going to have to send a new notification to every single person in every single tweet you’ve ever liked. Thousands upon thousands of them. For tweets that can be years old.</p>



<hr>



<p>I like it when people like my tweets. I come up with witty, snarky things to say so that people click ‘like’. I want to write more of them. It keeps me coming up with ‘tweetable’ things to say.</p>



<p>At its most cynical, “like” is the endorphin button: Every time you like someone’s tweet you’re sending them a tiny little burst of pleasure that keeps them addicted to Twitter.</p>



<p>The sad thing is, the better you <em>are</em> at twitter — the better you are at pithy, wry sarcasm in short form — the more effective you are at keeping everyone else addicted to an intentionally-addictive platform.</p>



<p>We all are each other’s drug pushers.</p>



<hr>



<p>The only way someone won’t get a notification when you “like” their tweet is if (a) they don’t follow you, and (b) you set your account to ‘private’ mode first.</p>



<p>To get an exhaustive list of the tweets you’ve liked, you have to download your Twitter “data archive”, a <code>.zip</code> file of all data Twitter keeps on you (that they want to admit to). In the <code>date/like.js</code> file is the list of all the likes, along with their ID numbers.</p>



<p>This would be enough to use the API to ‘like’ and ‘unlike’ each tweet, but if you want to reduce the disruption to others you need to take more steps.</p>



<p>I used the Twitter API to retrieve the full details of every Tweet in the list so that I could group them by author and by accounts mentioned in the Tweet. I ended up writing some unreasonable amount of Python and SQLAlchemy code to correlate them all.</p>



<p>My plan was to group the operations so that I could (a) prevent notifications to strangers by being in ‘private mode’ whenever I was running my program, and (b) when it came time to disrupt my friends’ by sending them notifications, I’d try to group them all so it all happened at once instead of spread out over interminable days of hundreds of notifications.</p>



<p>It <em>would</em> be hundreds, after all: your likes are pretty proportional to the tweets you see. The tweets you see most tend to be the friends you’ve followed the longest.</p>



<p>I started working my way through the list. A couple of times a day the routine was:</p>



<ul><li>set my twitter profile to ‘protected mode’</li><li>start my script. Watch it chug through ‘liking’ and ‘unliking’ a stream of tweets</li><li>crash when the rate limit was hit</li><li>reset my Twitter profile to ‘public’ mode</li><li>wait a couple hours, and repeat</li></ul>



<p>For friends of mine who’s tweets I’d liked *hundreds* of times, I either <strong>blocked</strong> them first so they wouldn’t get notifications (knowing I could unblock them afterwards, and invite them to re-follow me), or I tried to message them first to warn them that I was about to spam them.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear friends, over the next several days you're likely to see every tweet of yours I've ever "liked" get a fresh "like" notification — even years-old ones.</p><p>They're all good tweets.</p></div>— Tom Eastman (@tveastman) <a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1260676895328198656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For the people who get scores-to-hundreds of notifications, having this tweet pinned on the top of my profile would at least give them some explanation as to what the hell was happening.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OKAY, THIS MAKES MORE SENSE NOW</p>— Dr Sophia Frentz 🌈 (@SophiaFrentz) <a href="https://twitter.com/SophiaFrentz/status/1261194791729020933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It definitely weirded people the hell out though. Some of my friends politely removed me till it was done.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tveastman</a> muting u my friend.

</div></figure>



<p>I also accidentally re-started conversation threads left hanging years previously, thanks to the fresh notification on an old tweet.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lol Tom Necro, also HTTP/3 is almost here which doesnt even use TCP</p>— Beau Butler (@oddynz) <a href="https://twitter.com/oddynz/status/1261228701947068416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But finally, after about two weeks of running the script at least once a day until rate-limited, I had finally deleted all my likes. Finally, I had a clean slate.</p>



<p>Only, I didn’t.</p>



<figure><img src="https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna.png" alt="" srcset="https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna.png 609w, https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna-340x243.png 340w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px"><figcaption>Completionists gonna have a hard time with this</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can’t delete a like on an old tweet without ‘liking’ the tweet again.</p>



<p>It turns out that there are plenty of tweets old tweets you might have hit ‘like’ on once, but you can’t see any more.</p>



<p>Tweets from deleted or suspended accounts <em>remain</em> in the count even if they’re not visible by the system. Tweets by people who you don’t follow who have protected their accounts are inaccessible.</p>



<p>Tweets that you liked, by Twitter users who have subsequently blocked you, can never, ever by removed by you.</p>



<p>And so, at the end of the day, I can no longer see my liked tweets, but maybe you can. And some of the tweets will be people who no longer follow me, and some of them — there forever — will be from people who loath me.</p>



<hr>



<p>What was the point of all this?</p>



<p>When it became obvious that I wasn’t going to be able to delete my like history without sending thousands of notifications. I decided to press on with the project because I wanted to see exactly what social cost Twitter would exact upon me, just for trying to reclaim my own data.</p>



<p>I didn’t measure how many people unfollowed me, but I certainly got some bewildered reactions. I had friends reach out to me out-of-band to ask me if my account had been hacked.</p>



<p>And for all that, it turned out to be un-completable. Twitter will not allow you the means to completely wipe your “like” history short of actually deleting your account.</p>



<p>‘Likes’ might not seem important. But it’s critical to the sorts of algorithms social media use to tune their feeds to keep you hooked, and to target you with advertising. They’re also a paltry, lazy mode of communication. From now on, if I like someone’s tweet, I’ll conjure the mental effort to at least tell them so, with words.</p>

<p>In the midst of a global health crisis like <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="COVID-19 (opens in a new tab)">COVID-19</a>, how could data be more helpful? The main reason for slow responses on the part of leadership, both in businesses and in governments worldwide, is the lack of a clear picture of the current and projected future situation. What if there was a way for billions of analysts with the ears of Presidents, CEOs and Prime Ministers, to have simultaneous access to a global database with real-time updates on an evolving situation that is actively impacting lives and economies? </p>



<p>Most companies are guilty of underutilizing the troves of data sitting at their fingertips. How much faster could we react to a global situation like the coronavirus if we had access to all of that data and were able to interact with it via simple, user-friendly data-visualization dashboards that provide sub-second query response times? </p>



<p>While we may not yet have a system in place that provides a
global data service on this level, the technology is already here. We can
prepare for our future by implementing it and taking full advantage of the
stores of data we already collect on a daily basis. Given the range of global responses
to COVID-19, the need for a collaborative and universal data source is clear. </p>



<p>Our best chance of avoiding the next pandemic is to learn from our mistakes and our ignorance in the current rapidly developing international crisis and use that knowledge to improve our data infrastructures and emergency protocols so that we can be ready to share critical data and perform concurrent sub-second analysis en masse around the world. </p>

<p>Fortunately, businesses and governments are now taking action. A great example of this is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="China Mobile (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.chinamobileltd.com/en/global/home.php" target="_blank">China Mobile</a>, which played a major role in providing critical data and insights to Chinaâ€™s government, businesses, and citizens as they dealt with the initial outbreak of the coronavirus. </p>

<p>China Mobile, one of the top telecommunication operators in China (the equivalent of AT&amp;T or T-Mobile in the U.S.), built a coronavirus data analysis dashboard using <a href="https://kyligence.io/kyligence-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kyligence (opens in a new tab)">Kyligence</a> that helped guide the decisions of the Chinese government, businesses, landlords, and citizens and enabled them to act quickly when it came to determining who to quarantine, how long those people should remain in isolation and what regions were most likely to need additional support to contain and recover from the outbreak.</p>



<p>Utilizing cellphone data to track the location history of
individuals across the country, they were able to help identify anyone who had
been to the high-risk areas the government had identified as Zone A or Zone B.
This allowed government officials and business leaders to make on-the-spot,
data-driven decisions to reduce the spread of the virus. Those who had been to
Zone A or B in the last few months were asked to stay home and self-isolate for
14 days, whereas those who had only been to Zone C were considered low-risk and
free to move about as needed.</p>



<p>The way this tool works is by calculating the location of a
given cellphone signal over a specified period of time. It then identifies the
people who were near this individual, including those that live or work nearby
or were visiting the designated area, based on their cellphone signals,
providing the user with a list of people that may have been exposed to the
virus if the individual in question tested positive for COVID-19.</p>



<p>For example, a user of this dashboard can choose a city that has had many confirmed cases of the virus and send an SQL script to a Kyligence <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OLAP cube (opens in a new tab)" href="https://kyligence.io/blog/olap-analytics-is-dead-really/" target="_blank">OLAP cube</a>. The Kyligence data service will then locate and identify anyone currently in that designated city who has traveled to areas that are known to have had an outbreak of the virus within the last month based on their cellphone signalâ€™s location history. The high-risk individuals are then displayed as red dots.</p>



<p>The rapid response of China Mobile to this emergent health crisis was invaluable for those reacting to the situation. Having access to this information gave people critical information to keep their communities safe. </p>







<h2><strong>How Kyligence Monitored COVID-19</strong></h2>



<p>At the end of January 2020, families across China prepared to travel around the country to see their friends and families for the biggest holiday of the year, Chinese New Year. Leading into this holiday, cases of coronavirus spiked in China and the government responded by extending the holiday for an extra week to keep businesses closed and people safe at home.  </p>



<p>During this extended holiday, Luke Han, CEO of Kyligence, set up a project to monitor the progress of the virus in China. He quickly pulled a team together and within 6 hours they had completed the provisioning of the entire cluster with <a href="https://kyligence.io/kyligence-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kyligence Cloud (opens in a new tab)">Kyligence Cloud</a>. Over the next 2-3 days, the team worked to prepare the data and build the report. </p>



<p>The team built a dashboard pulling from open source data
that reported a daily breakdown of how many patients in China:</p>



<ul><li>Were confirmed to have the virus</li><li>Were suspected to be infected</li><li>Had been cured</li><li>Had died</li></ul>



<p>This data could be broken down and viewed by date, province, and city as shown in the two graphs below. </p>

<p>Our team of 6 included a cloud architect, two ETL
developers, two data modelers and one data analyst. From the data they analyzed,
they were able to derive a range of additional metrics regarding the amount of
confirmed cases as well as confirmed death rates and cured rates:</p>



<ul><li>Per hospital, per hospital bed, per doctor, and per nurse </li><li>Per million in the population</li><li>Per square kilometer</li></ul>



<p>Their analysis showed that Hubei Province was experiencing the highest pressure by far on medical resources based on the number of confirmed cases per million and the number of cases confirmed per hospital (see the two graphs below). </p>

<p>The team was also able to conclude that the tests to confirm if a person has the illness are administered and processed faster than the virus itself spreads. On February 5<sup>th</sup>, the total suspected cases fell below the total confirmed cases (graph below). As soon as someone was suspected of being infected, they were able to receive the test and their results rapidly, allowing for timely isolation and prevention of further spreading of the virus. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/03/China-COVID-19-Dashboard-5.png" alt="China COVID-19 Dashboard 5" srcset="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/03/China-COVID-19-Dashboard-5.png 974w, https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/03/China-COVID-19-Dashboard-5-300x91.png 300w, https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/03/China-COVID-19-Dashboard-5-768x234.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px"><figcaption><strong>Example 5: Kyligence COVID-19 Tracking Dashboard</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The importance of testing and isolating positive cases has since been re-emphasized by communities battling this virus around the world. Most notably one small town in Italy, Vo Euganeo, the location of the first death in that country. The people of this town aggressively tested and isolated patients with COVID-19 to the point of <a href="https://www.livescience.com/small-italian-town-cuts-coronavirus-cases-testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">eliminating the virus</a> from their town completely.  </p>



<p>This technology is key to our ability to collaborate globally on rapidly developing emergency situations. Having timely access to this data empowered the senior leadership at Kyligence to act quickly to protect employees and their families by implementing remote-work policies based on the knowledge gained from this analysis. </p>



<p>Thanks to the rapid and decisive acts of Kyligenceâ€™s leadership, not a single employee<a><span color="#007fac"> </span></a>or member of their families has contracted the virus. This dashboard focused on China, but this technology could be used for any country or even on a global scale.</p>

<h2><strong>Implications for the Future â€“ How We Can Use Big Data to Prepare and React</strong></h2>



<p>These two Kyligence-powered dashboards that were built to monitor the status of this viral outbreak are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential applications for this technology on our ability to prepare for, and react more quickly to, the next global crisis. </p>



<p>With <a href="https://kyligence.io/blog/kyligence-augmented-olap-for-the-big-data-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kyligenceâ€™s technology (opens in a new tab)">Kyligenceâ€™s technology</a>, China Mobile was able to provide accessible data to the government, organizations and the general public that enabled them to respond efficiently and effectively to the epidemic (now pandemic) situation. </p>



<p>Kyligence provides a data service that can handle any size dataset so that analysts can do what they do best without needing to jump through hoops or wait minutes to hours between queries. The key to avoiding and surviving the next pandemic will be our ability to analyze data on a global scale, with teams from all countries able to utilize the same dashboards simultaneously. </p>



<p>This data service is capable of being accessed by millions, or billions, or people simultaneously. It provides all kinds of rich and standard interfaces including SQL, <a href="https://kyligence.io/kyligence-mdx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MDX (opens in a new tab)">MDX</a> and API so that any data scientist or analyst can perform self-service analysis as needed.</p>



<p>While Kyligence can build and provide the data visualization and reporting dashboards, our core product offering delivers a data service layer that can be consumed by many people, organizations or entire governments. In the case of a global health crisis like the sudden rise of COVID-19, there could potentially be billions of people accessing data at the same time. </p>



<p>That level of access requires very strong backend support with essentially non-existent query latency to ensure users are able to understand the data and act immediately. Leaders need to be able to quickly view and assess their data so they are able to make crucial decisions and act in the best interest of their families, their employees, and their citizens. </p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>In this series of posts I’ve done a lot of experimentation. An element which
I’ve had to implement a number of times is calling functions defined in a
WebAssembly module.</p>

<p>Calling a WebAssembly function involves transferring data to an instance,
calling a function, and retrieving the results. This is known as marshalling.</p>

<p>The source code for the examples can be found
<a href="https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/example-wasi-marshalling">here</a>
and the marshalling package
<a href="https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/jetblack-wasi-marshalling">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="our-first-c-function">Our First C Function</h2>

<p>Here is an example function written in C and compiled to WebAssembly.</p>

<pre><code>__attribute__((used)) double* multipleFloat64ArraysReturningPtr (
    double* array1,
    double* array2, 
    int length)
{
  double* result = (double*) malloc(length * sizeof(double));
  if (result == 0)
    return 0;

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
    result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];
  }

  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the highest level the function takes two floating point arrays which it
multiplies and returns the result. At a lower level, two pointers to double
arrays are passed with a length. A result pointer is allocated with the required
length in which the result is stored. Finally the pointer to the result array
is returned.</p>

<p>To make this happen, first memory has to be allocated for the two input arrays
in the WebAssembly module. The data must then be copied into the arrays. When
the function is called it creates a third array by allocating space in the
WebAssembly. The pointer to this memory is then returned. The JavaScript must
copy the result array, then free the two input arrays and the result array.</p>

<h2 id="our-first-javascript-prototype">Our First JavaScript Prototype</h2>

<p>I’ve written a package to simplify the marshalling of data between JavaScript
and WebAssembly. Here is how to create a binding for the function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>proto</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>FunctionPrototype</span><span>(</span>
    <span>[</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Int32Type</span><span>())</span>
    <span>],</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>(),</span> <span>4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This matches the <code>C</code> prototype.</p>

<pre><code>__attribute__((used)) double* multipleFloat64ArraysReturningPtr (
    double* array1,
    double* array2, 
    int length)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the return type also declares the length of the returned array. The
<code>C</code> function will only return a pointer to the start of the array, so we need
the length. In the real world we’d probably make a function out of prototypes
that require length parameters.</p>

<p>We can invoke the function as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>proto</span><span>.</span><span>invoke</span><span>(</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>multipleFloat64ArraysReturningPtr</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>],</span>
  <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>],</span>
  <span>4</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As well as the function arguments we provide <code>wasi.memoryManager</code> to allow
access to the WebAssembly memory and <code>wasi.instance</code> to retirve the function.</p>

<p>When the function is invoked three things happen. First the input arguments are
<em>marshalled</em>. Memory is allocated for each array, and the array data is copied
into that memory. The integer value can be passed directly.</p>

<p>Second the function is called with the marshalled aruments and the return value
is received.</p>

<p>Third the memory for the input arguments is freed, the result value is copied
from the WebAssembly memory to a JavaScript array, and the memory that was
allocated inside the WebAssembly instance is freed.</p>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>

<p>While not strictly part of WASI, memory management is the first problem to
solve. When a WebAssembly module is instatiated a memory buffer is either
passed, or created by the instance. When using the WASM standard library
provided by <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc">wasi-libc</a> the memory
management functions <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> can be exported from the instance.</p>

<p>After instantiation they are held in the following class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MemoryManager</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span> <span>(</span><span>memory</span><span>,</span> <span>malloc</span><span>,</span> <span>free</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>memory</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>malloc</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>free</span> <span>=</span> <span>free</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>dataView</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DataView</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An array of floats might be marshalled as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>marshallFloat64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>address</span> <span>=</span> <span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>Float64Array</span><span>.</span><span>BYTES_PER_ELEMENT</span> <span>*</span> <span>array</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>typedArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Float64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span> <span>array</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span>
  <span>typedArray</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>address</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An array that was allocated inside the WebAssembly instance might be
unmarshalled as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>unmarshallFloat64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>Array</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>typedArray</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>free</span><span>(</span><span>address</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="our-second-c-function">Our Second C Function</h2>

<p>Here is our second <code>C</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>__attribute__((used)) void multipleFloat64ArraysWithOutputArray (double* array1, double* array2, double* result, int length)
{
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
    result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This time the calling function allocates the memory for the output array and
passes it in.</p>

<h2 id="our-second-javascript-function-prototype">Our Second JavaScript Function Prototype</h2>

<p>The JvaScript function prototype looks as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>proto2</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>FunctionPrototype</span><span>(</span>
  <span>[</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>Out</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Int32Type</span><span>())</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We don’t need to provide a return type as nothing is returned. The <em>output</em>
argument is wrapped in an <code>Out</code> class to inform the marshaller to unpack it
after the function is called.</p>

<p>The function is called as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>output</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>proto2</span><span>.</span><span>invoke</span><span>(</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>multipleFloat64ArraysWithOutputArray</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>],</span>
  <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>],</span>
  <span>output</span><span>,</span>
  <span>4</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because we supplied the output array with the correct length, we didn’t need
to supply a length argument to <code>ArrayType</code>.</p>

<h2 id="wheres-wasi">Where’s WASI?</h2>

<p>So far there’s been no need for WASI. That ends with strings.</p>

<p>WASI enters the picture when we need to leave the WebAssembly sandbox and
interact with the system in which we’re running. It’s not obvious why this
should happen with strings. In JavaSCript strings use UTF-8. As soon
as we need to decode a string the C standard library will want to know about
our <em>locale</em> (our language environment). To do this it it checks the environment
variables, which exist outside the sandbox!</p>

<p>This introduces the first of our system call requirement: <code>environ_sizes_get</code>
and <code>environ_get</code>. The first call finds the amount of space required to store
the environment variables; the second fetches them.</p>

<p>The other need for WASI is when the code interacts with stdout/stderr. While
we might think this is unnecessary, it is common for C libraries to report
errors through the <code>perror</code> function which returns and error and reports the
cause to stderr.</p>

<p>There are a small bunch of functions we need to support here. The final outcode
is the following set of imports to the WebAssembly.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>WebAssembly</span><span>.</span><span>instantiate</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>

<p>We’ve got a ganeric marshalling layer between JavaScript and WebAssembly which
is pretty cool! We’ve also got enough WASI to drop in publically available
<code>C</code> libraries.</p>

<p>We’ve not yet addressed C++ libraries and we’re waiting for the <code>flang</code> compiler
to be incorporated into the <code>llvm</code> toolchain, so there’s a way to go before we
have access to everything we need to use JavaSCript to do real work with
native libraries.</p>

	With no clear direction from the federal government on how to handle the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s been hard to decide what’s safe and unsafe as states begin to open up. There's no right answer; you just need to know the risks and how much risk you're willing to take. That's why Professor Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Arizona,&nbsp;Dr. James P. Phillips, MD, the Chief of Disaster Medicine at GWU Emergency Medicine, and I developed a COVID-19 Risk Index to help you do this, based on four key factors:</p>
<p>
	1) Enclosed space</p>
<p>
	2) Duration of interaction</p>
<p>
	3) Crowds</p>
<p>
	4) Forceful exhalation&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Again, we hope this Risk Index is helpful to you as you decide what you are comfortable doing as these activities become available. We created this as a public service, so please feel free to tweet, post, e-mail, and print and hang this on your refrigerator&nbsp;or around your workplace. You can download the infographic <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2ecgl0wur1kyzp/COVID-19%20risk%20infographic_final.pdf?dl=0">here</a></p>

I actually quite like AWS and its offerings. I’m making this post because I’m genuinely curious
how to interpret the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/">AWS Acceptable Use Policy</a>. The static content for this blog is hosted within an
AWS S3 bucket. Does saying “Fuck You AWS” constitute offensive content?</p>

<p>The section titled ‘No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content’ says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may not use, or encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use, the Services or AWS Site for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive. Prohibited activities or content include:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Offensive Content. Content that is defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes child pornography, relates to bestiality, or depicts non-consensual sex acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Otherwise objectionable” seems to cast a very wide net.
One of my <a href="http://thoughts.josephdeon.me/2020/07/01/hello-weblog.html">three goals</a> for self hosting this blog was ownership. To me part of
ownership is being able to express myself freely. I hoped that meant as
long as I worked within the confines of the law I would be in the clear.</p>

<p>If this post gets removed then I know I have not fully achieved my ownership goal and it
might be time to just host on a pi.</p>

<p><br>
P.S. I posted this to hackernews. It made it to the front page and generated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23717254">some discussion</a>.</p>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>The Hague, 2 July 2020</span></p>


<p><strong>At a joint press conference today, French and Dutch law enforcement and judicial authorities, Europol and Eurojust presented the impressive results of a joint investigation team to dismantle EncroChat, an encrypted phone network widely used by criminal networks. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the last months, the joint investigation made it possible to intercept, share and analyse millions of messages that were exchanged between criminals to plan serious crimes. For an important part, these messages were read by law enforcement in real time, over the shoulder of the unsuspecting senders. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The information has already been relevant in a large number of ongoing criminal investigations, resulting in the disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports. Certain messages indicated plans to commit imminent violent crimes and triggered immediate action. The information will be further analysed as a source of unique insight, giving access to unprecedented volumes of new evidence to profoundly tackle organised criminal networks.  </strong></p>

<p>In recent years, European countries have been increasingly affected by organised crime groups who are pervasive and highly adaptive, posing one of the most pressing security challenges faced by law enforcement and judicial authorities. In this regard, the abuse of the encrypted communication technologies is a key facilitator of their criminal activities.</p>
 

<p>Since 2017, the French <em>Gendarmerie </em>and judicial authorities have been investigating phones that used the secured communication tool EncroChat, after discovering that the phones were regularly found in operations against organised crime groups and that the company was operating from servers in France. Eventually, it was possible to put a technical device in place to go beyond the encryption technique and have access to the users' correspondence.</p>

<p>In early 2020, EncroChat was one of the largest providers of encrypted digital communication with a very high share of users presumably engaged in criminal activity. User hotspots were particularly present in source and destination countries for cocaine and cannabis trade, as well as in money laundering centres.</p>
 

<p><a href="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/doclibrary/corporate/Infographics/The%20dismantling%20of%20an%20encrypted%20phone%20solution%20used%20by%20organised%20crime%20groups%2c%202020/2020-07_Infographic-Encrochat-Case.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR-infographic-thumbnail.png" alt=""></a>Given the widespread use of the encrypted telephone solution by EncroChat among international criminal networks around the world, French authorities decided to open a case at Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, towards the Netherlands in 2019. Further developments in the investigations led to organising the processing of the data, which was captured on the basis of the provisions of French law and with judicial authorisation, through the frameworks for international judicial and law enforcement cooperation. [<em>Click on image to enlarge</em>].</p>

<p>The data was in first instance shared with the Netherlands. Eurojust facilitated the creation of a joint investigation team (JIT) between the two countries and with the participation of Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, in April 2020. </p>

<p>Europol has been actively involved in the investigations led by France and the Netherlands since 2018, relating to the provision and use of encrypted communication services by organised crime groups. Through its role as an information hub and its extensive analytical and technical support system, Europol was able to create and provide a unique and global insight on the scale and functioning of organised crime, as a result of this investigation. This will help law enforcement to combat organised crime in the future more successfully. Europol’s support from the early stages of this JIT included: promoting and arranging international cooperation, providing extensive analytical and financial support, technical expertise and a secured platform for the exchange of information between the countries involved.  A large dedicated team at Europol investigated in real time millions of messages and data that it received from the JIT partners during the investigation, cross-checked and analysed the data, and provided and coordinated with the JIT partners the information exchange to concerned countries.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR_GendarmerieNationale.jpg" alt="">A large number of suspects have also been arrested in several countries which were not participating in the JIT but particularly affected by the illegal use of these phones by individuals active in organised crime, including in the UK, Sweden and Norway. Many of these investigations were connected with international drug trafficking and violent criminal activities.</p>

<p>At the same time, numerous operational meetings for the daily coordination between the law enforcement entities of the JIT partners and other countries took place at Europol, partly during COVID-19.</p>

<p>Eurojust intensively facilitated the judicial cooperation, during the extensive use of European judicial cooperation instruments such as European Investigation Orders. Throughout the investigation, the JIT members organised five coordination meetings at Eurojust to bring all involved parties together in a secure environment, identify parallel or linked investigations, decide on the most suitable framework for cooperation and solve potential conflicts of jurisdiction.  </p>

<p>In France, where the operation takes place under the code name "Emma 95", the Gendarmerie has set-up a Taskforce since March 2020. With more than 60 officers, the Gendarmerie leads the investigations targeting the EncroChat encrypted telephone solution under the supervision of the magistrates of the JIRS of Lille. The Taskforce has been monitoring the communications of thousands of criminals, leading to the opening of a wide range of incidental proceedings. France does not wish to communicate further on these on-going investigations nor on the results obtained. The considerable resources deployed demonstrate the importance of these investigations and the importance attached to their success in France. </p>

<p>In the Netherlands, where the operation went under the code name “Lemont”, hundreds of investigators have, with authorisation of the examining magistrate, followed the communications of thousands of criminals day and night since the operation began to unravel and act on the intercepted data stream. The criminal investigation has been led by prosecutors from the Dutch National Public Prosecution Service and the information has been made available to about a hundred ongoing criminal investigations. The investigation has so far led to the arrest of 60 suspects, the seizure of drugs (more than 10 000 kilo cocaine, 70 kilo heroin, 12 000 kilo cannabis, 1 500 kilo crystal meth and 160 000 liter of a substance used to produce synthetic drugs), the dismantling of 19 synthetic drugs labs, the seizure of dozens of (automatic) fire weapons, expensive watches and 25 cars, including vehicles with hidden compartments, and almost EUR 20 million in cash. The expectation is that information will be made available in more than 300 investigations. In a number of cases, more arrests are very likely to follow in the coming period. </p>

<p>The interception of EncroChat messages came to an end on 13 June 2020, when the company realised that a public authority had penetrated the platform. EncroChat then sent a warning to all its users with the advice to immediately throw away the phones.</p>
 

<p>While the activities on EncroChat have been stopped, this complex operation shows the global scope of serious and organised crime and the connectivity of criminal networks who use advanced technologies to cooperate on a national and international level. The effects of the operation will continue to echo in criminal circles for many years to come, as the information has been provided to hundreds of ongoing investigations and, at the same time, is triggering a very large number of new criminal investigations of organised crime across the European continent and beyond. </p>

<p><strong>What is EncroChat?</strong></p>

 
<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_encrochat.png" alt="">EncroChat phones were presented to customers as guaranteeing perfect anonymity (no device or SIM card association on the customer's account, acquisition under conditions guaranteeing the absence of traceability) and perfect discretion both of the encrypted interface (dual operating system, the encrypted interface being hidden so as not to be detectable) and the terminal itself (removal of the camera, microphone, GPS and USB port). It also had functions intended to ensure the ‘impunity’ of users (automatic deletion of messages on the terminals of their recipients, specific PIN code intended for the immediate deletion of all data on the device, deletion of all data in the event of consecutive entries of a wrong password), functions that apparently were specially developed to make it possible to quickly erase compromising messages, for example at the time of arrest by the police. In addition, the device could be erased from a distance by the reseller/helpdesk.</p>

<p>EncroChat sold the cryptotelephones (at a cost of around EUR 1 000 each) at international scale and offered subscriptions with a worldwide coverage, at a cost of 1 500 EUR for a six-month period, with 24/7 support.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some MuchSkills users must be wondering why we ask them to list their ‘job focus’ instead of ‘job title’. I’ve also been asked to define what we mean by ‘job focus’ by some of you, so I thought it might be good to explain what we mean by the concept here.</p><p>We wanted a term that helped us convey two things about ourselves to others:</p><ul role="list"><li>The skills we are proficient in.</li><li>The skills we are keen on using – those that energise us.</li></ul><p>The term ‘job title’ didn’t work for us for two reasons. One, it doesn’t tell us much about the skills people actually use during their work or about a person’s interest in deploying those skills. Two, we felt job titles were a throwback to an old order where titles were used as currency, indicating a person’s status in the hierarchy, and we believe modern egalitarian and collaborative workplaces don’t really need such hierarchies.</p><p>That inspired us to coin the term ‘job focus’.</p><p>At MuchSkills, we’d like to define ‘job focus’ as<strong>:</strong><em> “The value we bring to our colleagues and workplaces that is connected to our personal interests, values and competences.”</em></p><p>To record your ‘job focus’ on MuchSkills, you must answer these two simple questions: What is it that I’m good at? What is it that energizes me?</p><p>Let’s use my ‘job focus’ as an example.</p><p>It reads: Digital Strategy &gt; Business Strategy &gt; Digital Transformation &gt; User Experience Design &gt; UI Design &gt; Storytelling &gt; Design Thinking &gt; Sales.&nbsp;</p><p>These skills are arranged in order of importance – from top to bottom. The MuchSkills interface allows you to do this by increasing or decreasing the sizes of each bubble.</p><figure id="w-node-f7a825d2da2c-ba81df3a"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc27bf865f41cedb4b7b9a5/5ef35e2952537cab4fe9f40a_MuchSkillls%20-%20Noel.png" alt="Noel Braganza on MuchSkills - Job Focus, Soft Skills, Technical Skills profile"></p></figure><p>On the other hand, my job title is: Digital Product Designer. This title doesn’t tell you that there are so many other skills I am proficient in and enjoy working with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same story with so many other job titles.</p><p>Do remember that the emphasis of ‘job focus’ is on both “proficiency” <em>and</em> “interest”. If you are good at a particular skill, but aren’t really keen on using it now or in the future, you shouldn’t list it under ‘job focus’.</p><p>Before I entered the world of Digital Product Design, for instance, I was a copywriter and happened to be a good one too. Today if I ask myself what I am proficient in, one of the answers will be ‘copywriting’. But copywriting isn’t what interests or energises me today. It is not something I want to work with in the future. So I do not list it under ‘job focus’.</p><p><strong>The secret to staying engaged at work</strong></p><p>In my opinion, ‘job focus’ tells people – whether colleagues or hiring managers – way more about us and our capabilities than a CV or ‘job title’ can.</p><p>We believe this is important knowledge for hiring managers or team managers because when employees put their ‘job focus’ out there so that everyone can see the strengths they enjoy using at work, employers can use that information to match them with the right projects.</p><p>Why is this important?</p><p>Three words:<a href="https://www.muchskills.com/blog/are-engaged-employees-more-productive"> Increased employee performance</a>.</p><p>A<a href="http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2014_Dubreuil_etal_JofPosPsych.pdf"> 2014 study</a> published in <em>The Journal of Positive Psychology</em> validated the association between the use of an individual’s strengths and work performance. “…[E]ncouraging strengths identification, use, and development in human management practices can be an excellent way to promote work performance, thereby stimulating passion, vitality, and concentration at work,” the study concluded.</p><p>Gallup’s<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx"> <em>State of the American Workplace</em></a> report published in 2017 also found that workers want roles and employers that allow them to make the most of their strengths. “Employees do their best in roles that enable them to integrate their talent (the natural capacity for excellence), skills (what they can do) and knowledge (what they know),” it said.</p><p>That’s not all.</p><p>The ‘job focus’ concept acknowledges that skills and interests change over time. There may be times when you upskill or find you are interested in developing an existing or new skill. The MuchSkills ‘job focus’ tab allows you to capture that by enabling you to increase or decrease the size of the bubble with that particular skill. All this is instantly visible to colleagues, managers and even recruiters (if you make your profile public).</p><p>So go ahead and list your ‘job focus’ now.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Today we are excited to share <a href="https://now.me/">now.me</a> -- a way to get right to the meeting you're supposed to be in right now.  At any given moment, if you visit the site, it will look at your calendar, see what video call you're meant to be in, and take you right there.  It works with most video call providers, including Zoom, Google Meet, Whereby, team.video, and others.  We have been using this tool internally for a while now, and thought we might as well share it with the world.</p>
<p>In a way it seems like a small problem to solve.  It's not so hard to open up your calendar, find the meeting you're supposed to be in, find the link to it, and open it up.  But at that moment when it's time to get together with your clients or colleagues, that time is precious. We want those brain cycles in to go toward preparing for the conversation that is about to take place.  Especially if we're running late, or if we're trying to get together materials to share, or deep in thought pondering whatever trade-offs we are about to weigh -- it can make a big difference not to have to context-switch at that moment.</p>
<p>As we use now.me, we find ourselves dreaming of next iterations: Beautiful as it is in its current state, it could be nice to add support for custom themes where we could set our own images, or toggle dark mode.  Another idea we've pondered is an option to keep a now.me tab open, and then when a meeting is about to start, it would show a notification and even automatically join the meeting in a new tab, with no interaction required.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear your feedback!  Try it out at <a href="https://now.me/">https://now.me</a></p>

<p>Although it is true that the need to create a brand new algorithm does not appear often in our days, it is also equally true that a programmer who has the ability to successfully <strong>combine analytic and synthetic thinking</strong> and efficiently solve a multi-dimensional problem will probably be proven to be more effective than somebody who does not.</p>
<p>Out of the three types of skills that I am mentioning above the one that requires the most <strong>programming talent</strong> is without a doubt the <strong>Algorithmic thinking</strong>; the most successful software companies are convinced about the the truth of this statement and this is why algorithms lie in the core of their interviewing processes.</p>
<p>Although talent is definitely required in most cases it is not enough when facing a new problem; we can certainly be assisted by some “methodical” steps that can serve as the blueprint for the creation of a solution and discussing them is the topic of this posting.</p>
<p>A summary of these “methodical” steps that I am usually following whenever I have to deal with an original problem is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articulate the problem with clarity and try to understand niche cases.</li>
<li>Creating several sets of testing input – output</li>
<li>Code at least one brutal force solution</li>
<li>Study the problem trying to understand it in depth.</li>
<li>Decide if an existing algorithm can solve it directly or a special “trick” is needed;</li>
<li>Can one of the standard methodologies like graph, recursion, dynamic programming or data structures can be used?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will now pick a simple algorithmic problem and try to explain the thought process to solve it.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>This is a well known problem that can be found in several websites that specialize on preparing candidates for programming positions.<br>
Assume a water tank which has multiple parallel movable divisors placed in different locations as can be seen in the following picture:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank.gif?resize=490%2C330" alt="tank" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>To better understand the picture you have to think that its third dimension is omitted; the blue bars represent the divisors that can be removed. Each divisor is set in a specific distance that cannot change.</p>
<p>The objective is to discover the two divisors that can hold the most water when others will be removed.</p>
<h2>First thoughts</h2>
<p>Now that we have the problem clearly defined, lets pause for a second and try to put together a trivial solution which will solve it without considering its performance.</p>
<p>The fact that we are looking for a <b>pair </b>of divisors makes it obvious that if find all the divisor pairs and calculate the covering areas for each of them and simply select the largest one (we do not need to consider the third dimension since it will be the same for all the pairs.</p>
<p>Before we do any coding and using the picture above we can create the testing data to check our brutal solution and verify it.</p>
<p>Eyeballing the picture we immediately see that there are two candidate solution:</p>
<p>The 1 – 10 pair results to 3 X 9 = 27 while the 3 – 6 pair to 7 X 3 = 21 <strong>so the expected solution will be 28.</strong></p>
<h2>Describe the problem programmatically</h2>
<p>At this point it makes sense to try to describe the problem in a programming language (for this example we will use python).</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is to represent the water tank programmatically. We can start by introducing a class to hold the coordinates of the upper point of each location:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])
</pre>
<p>Now using Point we can represent the tank as follows:</p>
<pre title="">tank = [Point(1, 3), Point(3, 9), Point(6, 7), Point(10, 4)]
</pre>
<p>Also we can declare the function to calculate the max_area:</p>
<pre title="">def get_max_area(points):
    pass
</pre>
<p>Since we already have calculated the expected answer we can add an assertion to validate our solution:</p>
<pre title="">assert get_max_area(tank) == 28
</pre>
<p>At this point our code should look as follows:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])

tank = [Point(1, 3), Point(3, 9), Point(6, 7), Point(10, 4)]

def get_max_area(tank):
    pass

assert get_max_area(tank) == 28
</pre>
<p>If we run the program we should see the following output:</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-1.gif?resize=678%2C109" alt="tank-1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>A Brutal solution</h2>
<p>Assuming that we are having a pair of Points (representing two divisors) its covered area can be found if we multiply its width by the lower divisor:</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-2.gif?resize=486%2C328" alt="tank-2" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In this example the area will be covered by a 7 X 3 rectangle; 7 is the height of the lower divisor while 3 is the distance between them.</p>
<p>To simplify our solution, we can define a function which will receive two divisors as Points and return the enclosed area:</p>
<pre title="">def get_area(p1, p2):
    width = p2.x - p1.x if p2.x &gt; p1.x else p1.x - p2.x
    height = min(p2.y,  p1.y)

    return width * height
</pre>
<p>Now we are ready to implement the brutal solution. We should simply create all possible pairs of divisors, calculate the area for each of them and return the maximum value:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
import itertools

Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])

tank = [Point(1, 3), Point(3, 9), Point(6, 7), Point(10, 4)]

def get_area(p1, p2):
    width = p2.x - p1.x if p2.x &gt; p1.x else p1.x - p2.x
    height = min(p2.y,  p1.y)

    return width * height


def get_max_area(tank):
    max_area = 0
    for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(tank, 2):
        max_area = max(max_area, get_area(p2, p1))
    return max_area


assert get_max_area(tank) == 28
</pre>
<p>If we run the program above we will see that it completes without an error so our thought process was correct.</p>
<h2>The problem with the brutal solution</h2>
<p>Our brutal solution appears to be correct, so now let’s see how it scales. Let’s go ahead and stress test it by creating a tank that consists of a large number of points and see how it behaves. To do so we need to write a function to generate random points and call our get_max_area with increasing number of divisors:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
import itertools
import random
import timeit
import functools

Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])


def get_area(p1, p2):
    width = p2.x - p1.x if p2.x &gt; p1.x else p1.x - p2.x
    height = min(p2.y, p1.y)

    return width * height


def random_points(count, max_height):
    for x in random.sample(range(1, count * 10), count):
        y = random.randint(1, max_height)
        yield Point(x, y)


def get_max_area(tank):
    max_area = 0
    for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(tank, 2):
        max_area = max(max_area, get_area(p2, p1))
    return max_area


for count in [100, 1000, 5000, 10000]:
    tank = list(random_points(count=count, max_height=12))
    print(
        'count:', count, 'duration:',
        timeit.timeit(stmt=functools.partial(get_max_area, tank), number=1)
    )

</pre>
<p>So, running the above program resulted on the following output on my computer:</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-3.gif?resize=599%2C132" alt="tank-3" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>As you can see although our solution works fast enough when the number of divisors is low it grows very fast and when we are trying 10,000 of them it takes more than 41 seconds!</p>
<p>The poor performance is caused from the fact that we are calculating the area for all the possible pairs.</p>
<p>We now that the possible combination of n things by k are given by the following formula:</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CodeCogsEqn.gif?resize=169%2C44" alt="CodeCogsEqn" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So assuming we have 10,000 divisors, the possible pairs will be:</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/combos.gif?resize=161%2C44" alt="combos" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>which equals 49,995,000 or in other words it has a time complexity of O(C(n,k)) which results into an extremely slow solution.</p>
<p>At this point we must revisit our problem and think if we can come up with a “smart trick” that will allow us to improve our solution.. Please pause for a while and think our problem again trying to detect if there is something that will allow us to bypass most of the calculations of the brutal solution and then move on to the explanation of the efficient solution..</p>
<h2>The trick</h2>
<p>Lets revisit our original example and try to go step by step to an efficient solution. This time we will start by calculating the area of the first and last point as can be seen in the following picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-4.gif?resize=461%2C308" alt="tank-4" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The area between the first and the last point is: <strong>3 X (10 – 1) = 27</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that we use the point with the lower height and multiply it by the distance.</p>
<p>The trick arises is exactly here.</p>
<p>Note that for obvious the point with the lower height is impossible to result to a larger area when combined with any other point. This means that once we have calculated the first – last area in our example we can simply get rid of the first point without having to deal with it anymore.</p>
<p>This is a great improvement over the brutal solution since for it each point (including the first) has to be paired with all the others. In our example this means that for the brutal solution the first point is matched against all the three others but as we can see we do not need to do so since it is impossible to find a larger area anywhere else except the last point.</p>
<p>Following our observation, we keep the calculated area (27) remove the first point and continue to the next point as can be seen here:</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-5.gif?resize=455%2C305" alt="tank-5" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Note that now the last point is lower that the first; the enclosed area is <strong>4 X (10 – 3) = 28</strong> which replaces the previous maximum area value (was 27). Thinking in the same way we remove the last point and now our problem looks as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-6.gif?resize=453%2C310" alt="tank-6" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Now the enclosed area in <strong>7 X (6 -3) = 21</strong> which is less that the previous maximum area which remains 28 while we remove the lower Point and remain with a single point meaning that our problem is over and we have found the solution which is 28.</p>
<h2>The efficient solution</h2>
<p>Now that we have found the <strong>trick</strong> our next step is to re-write our get_max_area …</p></div></div>

    <em>Many languages have redundant features; progress in language design includes removing those features.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    (This post is also <a href="http://postd.cc/less-is-more">available in Japanese</a>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many programming languages, and new ones are being introduced all the time. Are these languages better than previous languages? Obviously, that's impossible to answer, since there's no clear measurement of what constitutes a 'better' programming language.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, if you look at a historical trend, it looks as though one way to make a better language is to identify a redundant language feature, and design a new language that doesn't have that feature.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this article, you'll see various examples of language features that have already proven to be redundant, and other features where we are seeing strong indications that they are redundant.

    When the first computers were created, programs had to be written in machine code or assembly language. In machine code, you can express everything the CPU can do, because the machine code is written it terms of a CPU's instruction set. While it's possible to write correct programs in machine code, you can also write a lot of incorrect programs, including programs that crash horribly, or perhaps even destroy the machine on which they are running.
  </p>
  <p>
    You're most likely used to writing code in a higher-level language, but even so, if you share my experience with this, you'll agree that it takes a lot of trial and error to get things right. For every correct program, there are many incorrect variations. The set of incorrect programs is much bigger than the set of correct programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    With machine code, you have limitless ways to create incorrect programs. Yes: you can express everything the CPU can execute, but most of it will be incorrect. Thus, the set of valid programs is a small subset of the set of all possible instructions.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Early computer programmers quickly discovered that writing in machine code was extremely error-prone, and the code was also as unreadable as it could be. One way to address this problem was to introduce assembly language, but it didn't solve the underlying problems: most assembly languages were just 'human-readable' one-to-one mappings over machine code, so you still have unlimited ways to express incorrect programs.

  </h3>
  <p>
    After having suffered with machine code and assembly language for some time, programmers figured out how to express programs in high-level languages. The first programming languages aren't in much use today, but a good example of a 'low-level' high-level language still in use today is C.
  </p>  
  <p>
    <img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/less-is-more-language-features-figure-02.png" alt="The set of all valid programs, inside the much larger set of all possible instructions, with the overlay of all possible instructions in a high-level language.">
  </p>
  <p>
    In C, you can express almost all valid programs. There are still tons of ways to write incorrect programs that will crash the program (or the computer), but since the language is an abstraction over machine code, there are instructions you can't express. Most of these are invalid instruction sequences anyway, so it's for the better.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice what happened: moving from machine code to a high-level programming language removes a feature of the language. In machine code, you can express <em>anything</em>; in a high-level language, there are things you can't express. You're okay with that, because the options that were taken away from you were bad for you.

  <p>
    In 1968, Edsger Dijkstra published his (in)famous paper <em>Go To Statement Considered Harmful</em>. In it, he argued that the GOTO statement was an bad idea, and that programs would be 'better' without the GOTO statement. This sparked a decade-long controversy, but these days we've come to understand that Dijkstra was right. Some of the most popular languages in use today (e.g. Java and JavaScript) don't have GOTO at all.

  </p>
  <p>
    Since GOTO has turned out to be an entirely redundant language feature, a language without it doesn't limit your ability to express <em>valid</em> programs, but it does limit your ability to express <em>invalid</em> programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do you notice a pattern?
  </p>
  <p>
    Take something away, and make an improvement.

  <p>
    There's nothing new about this; <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/2323-bobs-last-language">Robert C. Martin told us that years ago</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can't just arbitrarily take away <em>anything</em>, because that may constrain you in such a way that there are valid programs you can no longer write:

  <p>
    Today, everyone seems to agree that errors should be handled via some sort of exception mechanisms; at least, everyone can agree that <em>error codes</em> are <em>not</em> the way to go (and I agree). We need something richer than error codes, and something that balances usefulness with robustness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem with exceptions is that this mechanism is really only <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl">GOTO statements in disguise</a> - and we've already learned that GOTO is considered harmful.
  </p>
  <p>
    A better approach is to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union">sum type</a> to indicate <em>either</em> <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2">success or failure in a composable form</a>.

  <p>
    As Robert C. Martin also pointed out, in older languages, including C and C++, you can manipulate pointers, but as soon as you introduce polymorphism, you no longer need 'raw' pointers. Java doesn't have pointers; JavaScript doesn't do pointers; C# <em>does</em> allow you to use pointers, but I've personally never needed them outside of interop with the Windows API.
  </p>
  <p>
    As these languages have demonstrated, you don't need access to pointers in order to be able to pass values by reference. Pointers can be abstracted away.

  <p>
    Most strongly typed languages give you an opportunity to choose between various different number types: bytes, 16-bit integers, 32-bit integers, 32-bit <em>unsigned</em> integers, single precision floating point numbers, etc. That made sense in the 1950s, but is rarely important these days; we waste time worrying about the micro-optimization it is to pick the right number type, while we lose sight of the bigger picture. As <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/396/bugs-considered-harmful-with-douglas-crockford">Douglas Crockford explains, in JavaScript there's only a <em>single</em> number type, which is a great idea - just too bad it's the wrong single number type</a>.

  </p>
  <p>
    With the modern computer resources we have today, a programming language that would restrict you to a single, sane number type would be superior to the mess we have today.

    Null pointers <a href="#7874496bf5134a66ae5a6350cbb6c04f" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Nulls are one of the most misunderstood language constructs. There's nothing wrong with the concept of a value that may or may not be present. Many great programming languages have this concept. In Haskell, it's called <em>Maybe</em>; in F#, it's called <em>option</em>; in T-SQL it's called <em>null</em>. What's common in all these languages is that it's an <em>opt-in</em> language feature: you can declare a value as being 'nullable', but by default, <em>it isn't</em> (nullable).
  </p>
  <p>
    However, due to <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare">Tony Hoare's self-admitted billion-dollar mistake</a>, mainstream languages have null pointers: C, C++, Java, C#. The problem isn't the <em>concept</em> of 'null', but rather that everything <em>can</em> be null, which makes it impossible to distinguish between the cases where null is an appropriate and expected value, from the cases where null is a defect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Design a language without null pointers, and you take away the ability to produce null pointer exceptions.
  </p>  
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    If Tony Hoare is correct that null pointers cost billions of dollars in the last few decades, getting rid of that source of defects can save you lots of money. From Turing-complete languages like T-SQL, Haskell, and F# we know that you can express all valid programs without null pointers, while a huge source of defects is removed.

    Mutation <a href="#68650468d124404aacaa4916a8b2a51a" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    A central concept in Procedural, Imperative, and Object-Oriented languages is that you can change the value of a variable while executing your program. That's the reason it's called a <em>variable</em>. This seems intuitive, since a CPU contains registers, and what you actually do when you execute a program is that you move values in and out of those registers. It's also intuitive because the purpose of most programs is to change the state of the world: Store a record in a database. Send an email. Repaint the screen. Print a document. Etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it turns out that mutation is also a large source of defects in software, because it makes it much harder to reason about code. Consider a line of C# code like this:
  </p>
  <pre><span>var</span>&nbsp;r&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>this</span>.mapper.Map(rendition);</pre>
  
  <p>
    When the <code>Map</code> method returns, has <code>rendition</code> been modified? Well, if you follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command Query Separation</a>, it shouldn't, but the only way you can be sure is to review the implementation of the Map method. What if that method exhibits the same problem, by calling into other methods that <em>could</em> mutate the state of the application? There's nothing in C# (or Java, or JavaScript, etc.) that prevents this from happening.

    In a complicated program with a big call stack, it's impossible to reason about the code, because <em>everything</em> could mutate, and once you have tens or hundreds of variables in play, you can no longer keep track of them. Did the <code>isDirty</code> flag change? Where? What about the <code>customerStatus</code>?
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine taking away the ability to mutate state:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/less-is-more-language-features-figure-07.png" alt="The set of all valid programs, inside the much larger set of all possible instructions, with the overlay of the set of possible instructions in a language without mutation.">
  </p>
  <p>
    Most languages don't completely take away this ability, but as Haskell (a Turing complete language) demonstrates, it's possible to write any program without implicit state mutation.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, many people might object that Haskell is too difficult and unintuitive, but to me, that kind of argumentation is reminiscent of the resistance to removing GOTO. If you are used to relying on GOTO, you have to learn alternative ways to model the same behaviour without GOTO. …</p></div></div>

<p>PostgreSQL instance has got restricted access by <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file(host based authentication file).</p>
<p>We can provide in it information from which <code>ADDRESS</code> to which <code>DATABASE</code> on which <code>USER</code> by what <code>METHOD</code> we allow connecting. Additionaly we have to provide <code>TYPE</code> of connection.</p>
<p>This file resides in same place where <code>postgresql.conf</code>(we can alter this behavior by setting <code>pg_hba</code> parameter in <code>postgresql.conf</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>postgres@postgres-lab ~<span>]</span>$ cd /postgresql/data/

<span>[</span>postgres@postgres-lab data<span>]</span>$ vi pg_hba.conf

<span># IPv4 local connections:</span>
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
<span># IPv6 local connections:</span>
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
</code></pre></div><p>Allowed <code>TYPE</code>'s:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>local</code> - socket connection - needed to connect from shell on database server</li>
<li><code>host</code> - standard TCP/IP connection over the network - bnost SSL and no SSL</li>
<li><code>hostssl</code> - TCP/IP connection but only with SSL</li>
<li><code>hostnossl</code> - TCP/IP only without SSL</li>
<li><code>hostgssenc</code> - TCP/IP only GSSAPI</li>
<li><code>hostnogssenc</code> - TCP/IP only without GSSAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>DATABASE</code> we can specify database name or use special value <code>sameuser</code> if database name should be same as name of user that is connecting.</p>
<p>With <code>USER</code> we can specify user or role - role name should be preceded by <code>+</code> sign.</p>
<p><code>ADDRESS</code> field could be - hostname, IP range in CIDR format or special words:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>samehost</code> - which correspond to all IP adresses of database server</li>
<li><code>samenet</code> - which correspond to all IP in database server subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>METHOD</code> field we can set one of authentication methods - most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trust</code> - allow connection without password - moslty set for local connections from database server itself</li>
<li><code>reject</code> - reject connections</li>
<li><code>md5</code> - allow connections after getting from user password - encrypted</li>
<li><code>password</code> - allow connection after getting plain password - DO NOT USE in untrusted networks - better -&gt; never use this option</li>
<li><code>ldap</code> - getting account authorization data from LDAP server</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>DATABASE</code> and <code>USER</code> fields you can specify special word <code>all</code> if you don’t want to create any restrictions here.</p>
<p>There can be situation when we must use additional field named <code>auth-options</code> for specyfying details for example for <code>hostssl</code> connection type. This topic will be covered in another post.</p>

As an individual contributor, career ladders tell me what the company ostensibly values (and, by omission, what it doesn't value).</p> <p>I recently compiled this list of career ladders and figured I would share it here. Some ladders include nontechnical jobs, I will just look at engineering and engineering management.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/02/13/fog-creek-professional-ladder/">Fog Creek</a></strong>: from 2009, but obviously Joel's thinking has been very influential. Focus is on growing ownership, ability to write production code independently, shipping experience, and at senior levels, design/planning/architecture. Teamwork, self study, mentorship, and impact are all key, as well as the Joel Test.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder">Rent the Runway</a></strong> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>): from 2015. Takes a fun D&amp;D inspired Dex/Str/Wis/Cha stats based evaluation, corresponding to technical skill, productivity, impact, and communication/leadership. Management track is also included, with more focus on architecture, hiring, organizational skills, and leadership/salesmanship.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/04/03/artsy-engineering-compensation-framework/">Artsy</a></strong>: inspired by Rent the Runway</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://capgemini.gitbooks.io/grade-ladder/content/">CapGemini UK</a></strong>: also inspired by Rent the Runway</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://basecamp.com/handbook/appendix-05-titles-for-programmers">Basecamp</a></strong>: pretty simple.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://engineering.thumbtack.com/how-we-built-an-engineering-job-ladder-from-the-ground-up/">Thumbtack</a></strong> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ACBs-crUHnqf1wANUQwX9oZIDOi5tvJJXGWpKTcf00/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>): from 2019. Breaks down technical skills into <strong>code quality/testing</strong>, <strong>debugging</strong>, and <strong>scoping/project design</strong>, and nontechnical factors to <strong>collaboration, citizenship, leadership, and impact</strong>. Leadership is interestingly broken down into <strong>Autonomy, Judgement, Initiative, and Consensus Building</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="https://circleci.com/blog/why-we-re-designed-our-engineering-career-paths-at-circleci/">CircleCI</a></strong> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131XZCEb8LoXqy79WWrhCX4sBnGhCM1nAIz4feFZJsEo/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>): one of the most well known ladders, detailed but not overwhelming.

      <p>In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into PCA, from both a mathematical and implementation perspective.
We’ll derive the equation from the ground up, look at how we can compute it and finally end with what it can be used for. This post is primarily targeted at those with a basic understanding of PCA but want to know the assumptions it relies on, its properties and derive how it can be computed.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the repository containing the Jupyter notebook from which this is derived, it’s 
<a href="https://github.com/ymohamedahmed/blog-posts/tree/master/pca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-optimal-coding-perspective">The optimal coding perspective</h2>
<h3 id="finding-a-low-dimensional-representation">Finding a low dimensional representation</h3>
<p>PCA can be thought of as finding a low-dimensional representation of a set of vectors. Given points in an <em>n</em>-dimensional space, we might wish to find some new <em>k</em>-dimensional space (with <em>k</em> &lt; <em>n</em>) which captures as much of the <em>essence</em> of the original space as possible. The exact definition of capturing the ‘<em>essence</em>’ is subject to design, however, we can consider it from multiple perspectives.</p>


<p><img src="https://ymohamedahmed.github.io/post/pca/images/pca.svg"></p><h3 id="the-notion-of-reconstruction-error">The notion of reconstruction error</h3>
<p>If we take our low-dimensional representation and attempt to recover the original <em>n</em>-dimensional vector of each point, we could measure how much each point varies from its reconstruction. The difference between each reconstruction and the original, is one way of measuring the effectiveness of our new <em>k</em>-dimensional space and is the approach taken by PCA.  Naturally, this requires a definition of a <em>similarity</em> between two matrices. If we have a matrix $X$ of our original points and our reconstruction $X'$ then we can define the difference between them as a sum of the square of errors $\sum_{i,j} (X-X’)_{i,j}^2$.</p>
<p>This quantity is known as the <em>Frobenius</em> norm of the matrix $||X-X'||_F$ and is essentially an extension of the L2 ($||\mathbf{v}||_2^2 =  \sum_i \mathbf{v}_i^2 = \mathbf{v}^\top \mathbf{v}$) norm from vectors to matrices. It is just a fancy name for squaring every element in a matrix and taking their sum. Crucially, however, we can see that the Frobenius norm of a matrix, $A$, is precisely equivalent to $Tr[A^\top A]$ (see the illustration below).</p>


<figure>
    <img src="https://ymohamedahmed.github.io/post/pca/images/output_smaller.gif">
    <figcaption>Showing the relationship between the Frobenius norm and trace operator: $||A||_F^2 = \text{Tr}(A^\top A)$</figcaption>
</figure> 

<p>As a result, our error of interest, can be computed as $Tr[(X-X’)^\top (X-X’)]$, this will come in handy since the trace operator comes with a bunch of neat tricks for manipulating the matrices involved.</p>
<h3 id="pca-assumptions">PCA Assumptions</h3>
<p>We’ve defined how we’re going to evaluate this reconstruction, but not at all the means of performing the coding or its inverse.</p>
<p>PCA chooses to implement both the encoding and decoding as a matrix multiplication. So we can think of PCA as finding a matrix $D$ that will transform our input, $X$ to our coded version $C$ by a matrix multiplication (i.e. $C = XD$).
The matrix, $X$, being our original data of $m$ rows and $n$ columns.</p>
<p>We might choose, however, to use some matrix, $D_k$ which reduces the number of dimensions of our data from $m$ to $k$. To make it easier, we can tag the matrix with the new number of dimensions. If this is the case, then $D_k$ is of size $n \times k$ and so that the resulting coding, $C$, is of size $m \times k$.</p>
<p>One of the most crucial assumptions made by PCA is that the transformation matrix, $D_k$, has <strong>orthonormal</strong> columns. Criticially, this does not, technically, make it an <strong>orthogonal</strong> matrix since it may not be square and the rows may not be orthonormal.</p>
<p>This assumption is useful since it simplifies the reconstruction process, in fact, $X'$ can be computed as $XD_kD_k^\top$, i.e. we can use the transpose of the encoding matrix to perform the decoding.</p>
<p>To understand exactly why the reconstruction can be performed by the transpose of the matrix let’s consider a code $\mathbf{z}$ which we’ve generated as $\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$ and are decoding using $\mathbf{D}^\top$.</p>
<p>The reconstruction error is $(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z})^\top(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}-\mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$.</p>
<p>We can take the derivative with respect to the code $\mathbf{z}$, $\nabla_\mathbf{z} = -2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$, which given the definition of $\mathbf{z}$ is equal to $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$.</p>
<p>We defined our matrix to have orthonormal columns so we know that $\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{I}$ because the dot product of each column with itself will be one. Hence, our gradient is  $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. This tells us that our encoding/decoding system is at a stationary point in the reconstruction error. Note that this only tells us for an individual point that was encoded with a matrix that has orthonormal columns, decoding with the transpose is a good idea. It doesn’t tell us anything about how to pick $\mathbf{D}$ or what happens if you use it for multiple points.</p>
<p>Given these assumptions, we can reframe our problem as finding the coding matrix which minimises the reconstruction error.</p>
<p>This means that formally, for some given value $k$, we wish to discover the matrix $D_k^*$.</p>
<p>$$D_k^* = argmin_{D_k} ||X-X'||_F =  argmin_{D_k} ||X-XD_kD_k^\top||_F$$</p>
<h3 id="discovering-the-coding-function">Discovering the coding function</h3>
<p>Given that we wish to minimise the reconstruction error, let us attempt to discover the transformation precisely capable of this.</p>
<p>We’ll need a few tricks to get us there.</p>
<ul>
<li>$(A+B)^\top = A^\top + B^\top$</li>
<li>$(AB)^\top = B^\top A^\top$</li>
<li>$(A^\top)^\top = A$</li>
</ul>
<p>From the visual illustration, recall that we can write the reconstruction error as $\text{Tr}((X-XD_kD_k^\top)^\top(X-XD_kD_k^\top))$.</p>
<p>By using the rules  this can be expanded into $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(X^\top X -X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>We are, however, only interested in the effect of the matrix $D_k$ so we’ll axe the first term $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>Crucially, however, the trace operator has two useful properties for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s insensitive to cyclic permutations (i.e. $\text{Tr}(ABC) = \text{Tr}(CAB) = \text{Tr}(BCA)$)</li>
<li>the trace of a sum of matrices is the sum of their traces (i.e $\text{Tr}(\sum_i \mathbf{A}_i) = \sum_i \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}_i)$)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this, we can write the equation of interest as: $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}-2\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)+ \text{Tr}(D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since we define the columns of $D_k$ as being orthonormal, $\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{D}_k = \mathbf{I}$ and so we can rewrite the second term as $\text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$ which matches the form of the first term (from permuting it) and therefore can be written as the following maximisation.</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{D}_k} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$$</p>
<p>This is sets up exactly the quantity that PCA is attempting to maximise.</p>
<h4 id="relationship-with-eigendecomposition">Relationship with eigendecomposition</h4>
<p>Having happily derived the maximisation problem, I’ll do my best to convince you that this is, in fact, maximised by having the k-columns of $\mathbf{D}_k$ as the k eigenvectors of $\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}$ with largest eigenvalues. This will roughly take the form of an inductive proof. So let’s start with considering $k=1$, that is if we had the choice of using a single vector, what would we go with?</p>
<h5 id="base-case">Base case</h5>
<p>We’ll use the lowercase, $\mathbf{d}$, to emphasise that it’s a vector rather than matrix. So let’s try and tackle:</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d})$$</p>
<p>The trace of a scalar, is defined as itself, so we wish to find $$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>However, recall that we mandated as our first assumption that the columns of $\mathbf{D}$ are orthonormal and hence we know that $\mathbf{d}^\top\mathbf{d} = 1$.</p>
<p>This allows us to reframe this as a constrained optimisation problem and use Lagrange multipliers to discover which vector minimises the quantity of interest whilst satisfying the norm constraint. For convenience, we’ll use $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}$.</p>
<p>Hence we can write this as:
$$L(\mathbf{d}, \mathbf{A}, \lambda) = \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - \lambda(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{d} - 1)$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR Lagrange multipliers are just a technique for optimising a function over a specific region, in our case we’re not looking for all vectors but only ones with a norm of 1. We rewrite the function to include the constraint and take the derivative of the new function, known as the <em>Lagrangian</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By taking the derivative of $L$ we can find the solution.</p>
<p>$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{d}} = 2\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - 2\lambda\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>The derivative is precisely zero when $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \lambda\mathbf{d}$, that is when $\mathbf{d}$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
Furthermore, we can see that the quantity in fact takes on the associated eigenvalue since $\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{d}^\top \lambda\mathbf{d} = \lambda $, where $\lambda$ is the associated eigenvalue. This is always possible since we can mandate that the eigenvector has a unit norm.</p>
<p>Hence, we can see here that for the base case, the best vector is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.</p>
<h5 id="inductive-step">Inductive step</h5>
<p>Having showcased our hypothesis for $k=1$, let’s see what happens for other values of $k$. Precisely, let us show that if our hypothesis is true for some arbitrary $k$ then it is also true for some $k+1$. That is the best encoding matrix with $k+1$ columns, consists of the $k+1$ unit eigenvectors with the largest associated eigenvalues.</p>
<p>We are now interested in the following problem.</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{D}_{k+1}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_{k+1}^\top …</p></div></div>

<p>Leishmaniasis is a <a href="https://www.dndi.org/diseases-projects/leishmaniasis/">neglected disease</a>. As a disease of poverty, it has historically received <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530408/">limited funding</a> for discovery, development and delivery of new tools. Current treatment is costly, lengthy, painful and sometimes toxic. Like a handful of similar diseases, it is the scourge of whole regions affected by them, because we still miss cheap, safe and effective cures for them.</p>
<p>At the same time, new drug candidates are being developed and old ones are being tested every day. Today, millions of drug activity assays are available at the press of a button. In this Indaba Grand Challenge, we dare to ask you to help identify amongst the already known, tested and (often) approved drugs, potential cures for different forms of leishmaniasis.</p>

<p>Humanity has been remarkably successful in curing most of communicable diseases, be it of bacterial or viral origin. However, there remains a whole group of diseases that largely evade successful treatment – the ones transmitted by parasites. Large number of them is caused by a group of small, single-celled animals named <em><a href="https://www.dndi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rao_Drugdiscoverykinetoplastiddiseases_ACSInfectiousDiseases_2019.pdf">kinetoplastids</a>. </em>They cause such diseases as African sleeping sickness (caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>), Chagas disease (<em>Trypanosoma cruzii</em>) and&nbsp; Leishmaniasis (different <em>Leishmania</em> species). </p>

<p>Leishmaniases (as it is a whole group of diseases), are spread by bites of sandflies and readily communicated between animals (such as dogs). Out of 30 species that attack animals, 21 affect humans. There are more than 350 million people in nearly 90 countries, that live in areas where leishmaniasis is common. Around 90% of its most dangerous variant – visceral leishmaniasis –&nbsp; is recorded&nbsp; in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and Brazil, but disease is prevalent also in Mexico, South and Central America, Asia (excluding the South-East Asia), Middle East, southern Europe and Africa (in particular North and East Africa) .</p>

<p>Every year approximately 12 million people are afflicted with the disease, with over 2 million new cases each year, most of which is a cutaneous (skin) leishmaniasis (nearly 1.5 million), but nearly 25% comprises the most lethal, visceral variant. Parasite suppresses the host’s immune system to avoid eradication, which often leads to frequently lethal secondary respiratory infections.&nbsp; Yearly, approximately 50 thousand people die worldwide because of <em>Leishmania </em>caused diseases.  </p>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis causes swelling, malaise, wasting, damages spleen and liver, as well as leads to characteristic graying of skin (hence the name <em>black fever</em>). The fever caused by the disease lasts for more than two weeks and does not abate with antimalarial drugs. The cutaneous type makes for wide-spread sores that can take over a year to heal, and lead to necrosis (dying of tissue). It leads to scars on the face, neck, arms and legs. The third, mucocutaneous type causes both skin and mucosal ulcers, leading to the damage of soft tissues and cartilage, predominantly of nose and mouth area. All types tend to co-occur with AIDS (approximately 1 in 60 AIDS patients in south of France suffers from leishmaniasis).</p>

<p> The treatment for visceral leishmaniasis is problematic and relies mostly on antibiotics, which have a variable success rate. The most commonly used non-antibiotic drugs, containing pentavalent antimony (such as sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimonate) are toxic to the heart, kidneys, pancreas and bone marrow of the patient, leading to headaches, abdominal issues, vomiting and low levels of blood platelets. They also require a month-long treatment through injections, as medication does not work well if taken by mouth. There is no safe treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, that would work dependably, with fluconazole (an antifungal medication) and pentamidine (an antimicrobial used for other kinetoplastid diseases) being the most promising support medications. Miltefosine, the first promising oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, tends to be effective for cutaneous form, but has limited use, as it is known to cause birth defects. </p>
<p>In the recent years a massive drug discovery campaign has led to discovery of a new drug (codenamed GNF6702) and its analog (a new, improved version, named NITD689), which affect parasites ability to degrade unnecessary and damaged proteins. While these drugs seem to work against a wide range of pathogens (including these causing African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and visceral leishmaniasis), they are not effective against the other leishmaniases. Additionally, there is an emerging mutation among the parasites, that already now renders the drug ineffective. Therefore, even though it is currently successful in the clinical trials, it will most likely not lead to the eradication of the disease.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>There is a dire need for a new, safe therapy for kinetoplastis, one that can be administered earlier, with lesser likelihood of bothersome side effects, one that could eradicate these diseases once and for all. Finding this therapy is the goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge, and literally lives are at stake. The approach to identify potential cure candidates is drug repurposing. </p>
<h2>What is Drug Repurposing?</h2>
<figure><img src="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg 910w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-300x198.jpg 300w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-768x508.jpg 768w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-85x56.jpg 85w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-234x155.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px"><figcaption>Photo Credit: pixabay.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Drug repurposing is the act of researching if an existing drug can be used for new therapeutic purposes. It’s something that has been done for centuries. A large amount of medications on the market right now are used for multiple purposes: for instance, aspirin is a pain reliever and also a blood thinner, ibuprofen is also used for pain relief, and for reducing inflammations.</p>
<p>The high cost of research and development involved in finding new drugs means that most of these will be targeted to “First World” countries to generate returns.</p>
<p>For “neglected diseases” or “tropical diseases”, drug repurposing is used as a sort of universal strategy: it lowers the costs of research and production and the time needed for clinic trials, which is why you’ll find that many of these diseases use medication that was originally used for other illnesses.</p>
<h2>The Challenge </h2>
<p>Drug discovery methods and pipelines are well described and modular. Each can be decomposed into smaller pieces, which can be rearranged and modified. All of these pipelines rely heavily on knowledge representation, pattern detection and building of statistical models.</p>
<p>The goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge is to, through the use of standard techniques and publicly available data on drugs, drug targets and kinetoplastids (parasites causing amongst other leishmaniasis), identify either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs which can target known drug targets in <em>Leishmania </em>(especially one of the 15 species known to cause the cutaneous type of disease)<em> </em>in addition to their official use.</li>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs with sufficiently similar targets in the goal organisms to the targets in kinetoplastids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the verification of a drug-target interaction is possible and routinely done <em>in silico</em>. However, not all drug-target combinations can be verified, due to sheer combinatorial expansion and limited computational resources. In addition, the identification of similarities and analogies between known experimental data is far from trivial and, despite the existence of numerous approaches, cannot be solved by one statistical technique alone.</p>
<p>By launching this Grand Challenge, and true to the core values of Deep Learning Indaba, we aim to build a <strong>collaborative effort</strong>, joining experts and enthusiasts in machine learning and software engineering, with doctors, epidemiologists, medicinal chemists and policy experts, to create a <strong>synergistic effect at scale</strong>. Our vision, if it becomes true, is one where interesting discoveries of the community are taken up by the experts, and conclusions of the experts are fed back to the community to iteratively improve on its findings and make breakthroughs possible. <strong>No single person can do it perfectly, but through a joint effort, together we can. </strong></p>
<h2> Challenge Specs </h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Propose a new treatment, comprising an <em>Leishmania </em>protein (either from a defined species, or a protein present in the proteome of one or more of the <em>Leishmania </em>species) and a small molecule (or set of small molecules). Submission can be specified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small molecule (SMILES/SMARTS string or SDF file) and a protein name</li>
<li>PDB file with a structure of a target and a bound small molecule</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Available resources: </strong>We have put together a list of available resources and additional material <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://deeplearningindaba.com/grand-challenges/leishmaniasis/resources/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

The issue has to do with how new features and new products are defined. Regardless of the client’s experience building digital products, SaaS, mobile apps, web apps, the majority generally tend to screw this up. As a Product Design Consultant, I haven’t worked on one feature where I didn’t have to provide clarity to strip down and simplify the scope. The real issue is that the client tends to give little thought to the product scope (amount and complexity of features) for the first version and how it feeds into the second version, through user feedback and analytics data, and how that feeds into the third version. Whatever you think your Minimal Viable Product is, can be stripped much further down.</p><p>I have a few theories as to why clients make this mistake.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>They’re too passionate and excited about the new feature or product, so there is a lot of attachment to the final product vision, which makes for emotional decision making</p></li><li><p>They have a really grand vision and they *think they’ve stripped down the scope to the core, when they haven’t</p></li><li><p>They think they have to build everything because of a bureaucratic reason</p></li><li><p>They think the user won’t like the feature or product, because the real value is in the combination of all of those features being in one place</p></li></ul><p>This mistake is important because building too much, too fast, will create a larger time frame between their starting point and their point of receiving positive feedback from users (qualitative feedback, product market fit, user analytics data or some KPI). This larger gap will lead to them running out of resources faster, whether it’s funding, or psychological motivation to continue.</p><p>I will use a couple of examples based on real clients I’ve worked with to explain my theory and how to go about the thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>1- The client was building a SaaS analytics dashboard for an enterprise use case. As with any data visualization dashboard, giving the user the ability to see an overview snapshot of data to answer their underlying business question is the primary goal, and the secondary goal is for them to dig deeper into specific data points to further uncover information that will guide their business decisions. The first step is to build the primary overview dashboard with the snapshot 30,000 ft view of the data and optimize that in the first version, then focusing on iterations. The second step is to build the deep dive views. If there is no interaction with the overview of the data because it’s deemed not interesting enough, because it’s answering the wrong business questions that the user doesn’t actually care about, then the deep dive views don’t matter, the user won’t try to dive deep into something irrelevant. The way to measure the interaction with the snapshot view of the data without having built the deep dive views was to allow click actions into that overview data, but just provide static deep dives, rather than fancy interactive deep dives that lead to more deep dives. In short, the secondary view, which in this case was the analytics deep dives, had to be stripped down a lot.</p><p>2- The client was building a social application. “We need the ability for users to comment, and for other users to respond to these comments via text, voice, and video.” If the initial user doesn’t comment, the corresponding feature of text, voice and video is utterly useless and literally unusable in the UI. So we built the initial comments section, measured the interaction using an analytics tool, or sometimes manually tracked what percentage of users left the initial comment. The idea was that if that percentage is high enough, we would continue with the rest of the product hypothesis, if it’s low, rethink the initial comment.</p><p>In short, design the core, core-core, like the actual core. Then strip it down further, and build it. And measure it, optimize it. And once it reaches a certain level, then you can start to build the rest, otherwise “the rest” will never be used, and won’t be given a fair chance to be measured.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>VSCode has become a staple for many developers local environment. One of the reasons is the powerful extensions which can be run from within the IDE itself, from type checking to code auto formatting. Here we will take a look at an overview of VSCode and then dig into how the auto formatting works. The final task will be to build a small version of Prettier (or eslint --fix) which can run as a VSCode extension. The goal is to understand the mechanics at work inside this kind of extension and some key differences with other types of extensions.</p>

<p>The article today will be broken down into 3 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#1-electron">Electron</a></li>
<li><a href="#2-vscode-extensions">VSCode extensions</a></li>
<li><a href="#3-our-own-prettier-extension">Our own Prettier extension</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>

<p>Under the hood VSCode is built with Electron. Electron is a software framework which allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies. It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. It was recently added to the <a href="https://openjsf.org/projects/">OpenJS Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of processes inside Electron</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Main process</p>
<ul>
<li>only 1 run at a time</li>
<li>job to handle all the <em>Renderers</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Renderer process</p>
<ul>
<li>many running at once</li>
<li>represents a page with UI</li>
<li>job to run code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A basic example of creating a new node process (renderer) is a below.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>{</span> fork <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"child_process"</span><span>)</span>
<span>let</span> serverProcess <span>=</span> <span>fork</span><span>(</span>__dirname <span>+</span> <span>"/server.js"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Messages are sent across processes via IPC (inter-process communication), this enables rendrer-to-renderer communication, bypassing the main process. The GUI's are Chromium web pages.</p>
<hr>

<p>VSCode has extensions which introduce more advanced functionality. As it is built with Electron it must conform to the process rules.</p>
<p>In VSCode all extensions run in a single <em>Renderer process</em> called the "extension host process" (process name <code>shared-process</code>, in task manager they are under <code>Code helper (renderer)</code>).</p>
<p>There seem to be 2 main types of VSCode extensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The extension host proccess does all the work</li>
<li>
<p>The extension host process runs a "client" whose job is to spawn a "server" <em>Renderer process</em>, which will do most of the heavy lifting. The server communicates with the client.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is common for a Language Server</li>
<li>it is worth noting that only the "extension host process" can update the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can see which process is running what task via the VSCode Process Explorer (CMD Palette "<em>Developer: Open Process Explorer</em>")</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="type-2---language-servers"><a href="#type-2---language-servers" aria-label="type 2   language servers permalink"></a>Type 2 - Language Servers</h2>
<p>Language Servers are background tasks spawned by an extension for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>TypeScript and Eslint are both examples of extensions which run Language Servers for their compilers. This is so the "server" can do the majority amount of the processing in the background, and only needs to relay messages (e.g. diagnostics) to the "client". They are often configured to re-run on save. This produces a more performant "client". In general it is good practice to run linters under a Language Server.</p>
<p>There are several strong pros of using Language Servers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Persistent memory and caching - the server never dies so can maintain a cache in memory to perform faster compiles in future runs</li>
<li>Faster boot up times - the server is already running shrinking any boot-up wait time to practically 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally it is worth noting that VSCode comes with its own <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">"Language Server Protocol"</a> which makes the client/server communication easier. It is a JSON-RPC standard between the development tool and the language server.</p>
<p>See example architecture below.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/vscode-arch.png" alt="VSCode extension architecture"></p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide">language server extension guide</a> available here. An extension must make use of <code>vscode-languageclient</code> to implement a language client and server.</p>
<h2 id="type-1---one-and-dones"><a href="#type-1---one-and-dones" aria-label="type 1   one and dones permalink"></a>Type 1 - "One-and-dones"</h2>
<p>For extensions which do not run a langauge server, a common term is "one-and-done".</p>
<p>Examples of this are Prettier and Mocha (non-watch mode). Where the extension/compiler runs once and then ends until it is called into action again, perhaps via a file save (assuming it respects your preference for <code>editor.formatOnSave</code>, which most extensions do).</p>
<p>They can be less performant than Langauge Server as no data or information is persisted and must run in its entirety each time. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no complex communication required between server and client.</li>
<li>for something like Prettier which reformats the entire file, it would require sending a huge amount of data between the client and server, so doing it all on the main extension process in the long run might be more performant.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>We are going to build a VSCode extension which will be a stripped down version of Prettier. It will run for 2 different scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-1"><a href="#scenario-1" aria-label="scenario 1 permalink"></a>Scenario 1</h3>
<h4 id="before"><a href="#before" aria-label="before permalink"></a>Before</h4>

<h4 id="after"><a href="#after" aria-label="after permalink"></a>After</h4>

<p>So for scenario 1 it will respect that no arguments are given and not change anything.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-2"><a href="#scenario-2" aria-label="scenario 2 permalink"></a>Scenario 2</h3>
<h4 id="before-1"><a href="#before-1" aria-label="before 1 permalink"></a>Before</h4>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>myFunction</span><span>(</span>one<span>,</span> two<span>,</span> three<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="after-1"><a href="#after-1" aria-label="after 1 permalink"></a>After</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>myFunction(
  one,
  two,
  three
);</code></pre></div>
<p>So for scenario 2 it will recognise the arguments, format them correctly and update the code in our file.</p>
<h2 id="lets-get-started-"><a href="#lets-get-started-" aria-label="lets get started  permalink"></a>Lets get started 💪</h2>
<h3 id="1-json-setup"><a href="#1-json-setup" aria-label="1 json setup permalink"></a>1. JSON setup</h3>
<p>Add necessary setup to <code>package.json</code></p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>  <span>"main"</span><span>:</span> <span>"./src/extension"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"publisher"</span><span>:</span> <span>"craig-vscode-extension"</span><span>,</span>

      <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will</p>
<ul>
<li>tell VSCode the extension JavaScript can be found in <code>./src/extension</code></li>
<li>register our extension to run on activation (when it starts), see <code>activationEvents</code></li>
<li>tell VSCode to title our extension under <code>Sexify it</code> inside the VSCode command palette.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aswell as a simple launch file <code>.vscode/launch.json</code></p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"0.2.0"</span><span>,</span>

<li>the <code>Statements</code> object contains functions for each AST node type, with knowledge of how to "reprint" them i.e. turn AST back into JavaScript. It contains an <code>ExpressionStatement</code> and a <code>CallExpression</code>, which is what we need for our scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bulk of the processing is on line 21-28.</p>
<ul>
<li>grab number of arguments in function - line 21</li>
<li>if not greater than 0 (line 22) return as is</li>
<li>else we add a line break (line 23) and process each argument (line 26)</li>
<li>
<p>details of line 26:</p>
<ul>
<li>add an "indent" then the "argument name"</li>
<li>check if it is last argument, if not add a coma followed by a line break, else just add line break</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>finally on line 29 we return an array of all the strings</li>
</ul>
<p>Our function would output the following from the above:</p>
<p><code>["myFunction", "(", "\n", " one,\n", " two,\n", " three\n", ")"]</code></p>
<p>It contains all the necessary code including the updated formatting. Notice the line breaks and indents.</p>
<h4 id="finally-the-code-to-kick-it-off"><a href="#finally-the-code-to-kick-it-off" aria-label="finally the code to kick it off permalink"></a>Finally the code to kick it off</h4>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/parse-reprint.png" alt="AST utilities"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>line 2 we convert out function string into an AST object</p>
<ul>
<li>using a 3rd party tool called <code>abstract-syntax-tree</code> for this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>line 4 we map over each item in the <code>body</code></p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>body</code> is an array of each "block" (sometimes a line, sometimes an entire function)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we call the <code>Statements</code> function for that AST node type (i.e. here will be <code>CallExpression</code>)</li>
<li>lastly on line 5 and 6 we flatten the new array and rejoin it so it becomes a string again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="checking-it-works"><a href="#checking-it-works" aria-label="checking it works permalink"></a>Checking it works</h2>
<p>So by running our extension in debugger mode (i.e. F5) we can open a file with our JavaScript in (example in <code>files/test.js</code>), highlight the code, open the "Command Palette" and find our "Sexify it" extension.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/sexify-it.png" alt="Our extension"></p>
<p>It will turn...</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>myFunction</span><span>(</span>one<span>,</span> two<span>,</span> three<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Into this</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>myFunction(
  one,
  two,
  three
);</code></pre></div>
<p>Confirming it works 👍. Converts our single-line function into multi-line with all the correct indents, exactly like Prettier does.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for reading or watching, I learnt a huge amount about VSCode and auto formatters from this research and I hope it was useful for you. You can find the repository for all this code <a href="https://github.com/craigtaub/our-own-prettier">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig 😃</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: Don’t trust AWS status reports, they’re misleading</em></strong></p>
<p>This morning at 1:00am the reporting systems for <a href="https://ww.ably.io/platform" rel="noopener">our Ably realtime platform</a> notified us of a whole range of service failures for one of our customers in a dedicated realtime cluster in AWS’ Northern California datacenter (us-west-1).</p>
<p>We investigated and discovered network partitioning along with other severe network failures. We checked the AWS status dashboard for information — nothing, all green. 30 minutes later AWS finally posted a status update with this:</p>

However he visits the AWS status page and doubts our “truth” because quite rightly, he says everything is green. Here is what the status page looked like:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Amazon AWS flat out lies</strong> — considering a cloud based network accessible service to be “operating normally” when the network is not working is insane</li>
<li>
<strong>We cannot trust Amazon AWS status updates </strong>because the information provided to us about the severity of the issue or how quickly it will really be resolved</li>
</ul>
<p>We suspect if we had reached out to AWS in this post-truth world, this is what we would have got:</p>

    "></figure><h3 id="so-what-should-have-happened">So what should have happened</h3>
<p>Fortunately that’s pretty simple — what we require is honesty and we expect AWS to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>Here’s what we did at <a href="https://www.ably.io/" rel="noopener">Ably</a> for our customers to notify them about what happened when we detected the fault:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had monitoring systems to tell us immediately there was a fault, which in turn created an incident automatically in <a href="https://status.ably.io/" rel="noopener">our status site</a> within minutes of the problems in us-west-1.</li>
<li>We then manually <a href="https://status.ably.io/incidents/377" rel="noopener">updated the incident on our status site</a> with our commentary and emailed everyone signed up for status updates with the issue and what we were doing about it (which was to route traffic away from the faulty datacenter).</li>
<li>We took an honest approach and weren’t worried to show a bit of orange on our status site. Because if something is not operating as expected, then we are pretty sure that is not classified as “operating normally” and at best should be classified as “performance issues”. See our status dashboard below:</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="amazon-aws-you-can-and-should-do-better">Amazon AWS — you can and “should” do better</h3>
<p>Our plea to Amazon AWS is please don’t fall into this post-truth trap and aim to have false green in your status dashboard. Looking at your AWS status dashboard today, in spite of the fact that an entire datacenter was unusable for a few hours this morning, is completely green. See the screenshots: (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1575409/Ably/blog/status-aws-amazon-today-1.png" rel="noopener">page 1</a>), (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1575409/Ably/blog/status-aws-amazon-today-2.png" rel="noopener">page 2</a>) — there is so much green on the status page that we were unable to fit the screenshot in one image (max height of 30,000 pixel). Amazon, your AWS status page today has 38,000 vertical pixels of green!</p>
<p>We rely on AWS infrastructure to deliver our realtime data delivery platform. Amazon needs to take their downtime and issues more seriously, be more upfront about what’s going on, and not wait half an hour to report that a datacenter being offline is “operating normally”. It’s not like they don’t have resources that outstrip any other infrastructure provider, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?%7Bgoogle:acceptedSuggestion%7Doq=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;gws_rd=ssl" rel="noopener">they’re hiring 100k employees in the next 18 months</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon AWS, we expect more of you. Please be honest.</p>

Quality of software is driven by both the talent of its creators and how they feel while theyâ€™re crafting it. Teams that have the time and energy to be focused on the work itself can build magical, high quality software. Our tools and practices need to do their best to nurture this, not take it away.</p><p>To bring back the right focus, these are the foundational ideas Linear is built on.</p></header><section><h2>Principles</h2><h3>Build for the creators</h3><p>Software project management tools should build with the end users â€“ the creators â€“ in mind. Keeping individuals productive is more important than generating perfect reports.</p><h3>Opinionated software</h3><p>Productivity software should be opinionated. It's the only way the product can truly do the heavy lifting for you. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.</p><h3>Create momentum â€“ don't sprint</h3><p>We should find a cadence and routine of working. In cycles, we decide priorities and assign responsibilities. Our goal is to maintain a healthy momentum with our teams, not rush towards the end.</p><h3>Meaningful direction</h3><p>Our daily work might be filled with tasks but we should understand and remind our teams of the purpose and long term goals of our work. Roadmaps, projects and milestones are all important to keep in mind as we plan our weekly schedules.</p><h3>Aim for clarity</h3><p>Donâ€™t invent terms if possible, as these can confuse and have different meanings in different teams. Projects should be called projects.</p><h3>Say no to busy work</h3><p>Our tools should not make us the designers and maintainers of them. We should throw away or automate the busy work so you can focus on the more important work.</p><h3>Simple first, then powerful</h3><p>Teams at different sizes have different needs. Tools should be simple to get started with and grow more powerful over time.</p><h3>Decide and move on</h3><p>There isn't always a best answer. The important thing is to make a decision, and move on.</p></section><section><h2>Practices</h2><h3>Set monthly, quarterly or/and annual roadmaps</h3><p>Ambitious goals are the only way to make a significant impact. Companies should focus on them when they define their high level direction. Reserve some space on your roadmaps for unexpected and reactive work that always comes up and allow your roadmap to change if needed.</p><h3>Connect daily work to larger goals with projects</h3><p>All projects and work should directly correlate to these goals. Review projects and their target dates during roadmap meetings and pull from projects as you plan cycles.</p><h3>Work in <i>n-week</i> cycles</h3><p>Cycles create healthy routine and focus teams on what needs to happen next. 2-week cycles are the most common in software building. They're short enough to not lose sight of other priorities but long enough to build significant features. Cycles should feel reasonable. Don't overload cycles with tasks and let unfinished items move to the next cycle automatically.</p><h3>Keep a manageable backlog</h3><p>You don't need to save every feature request or piece of feedback. Important ones will resurface and low priority ones will never get fixed. A more focused backlog makes it easier and faster to plan cycles, and ensures the work will actually get done.</p><h3>Mix feature and quality work</h3><p>All software has bugs, more than we can ever fix. Include bugs and other fixes as part of your cycles. Invest in tooling as it is a force multiplier if done right.</p><h3>Specify project and issue owners</h3><p>Each project should have a named owner responsible to own delivery and write the project brief. The same goes for issues. Others should collaborate but responsibility should lie with a single person.</p><h3>Write project specs</h3><p>Aim for brevity. Short specs are more likely to be read. The purpose of a spec is to briefly communicate the "why", "what" and "how" of the project to the rest of the team. Ideally these short documents force teams to scope out work so priorities are clear and teams avoid building the wrong thing.</p><h3>Understand your users</h3><p>The more popular your product, the more feedback you'll get. Overflowing inboxes are a good sign unless they're bug reports. Donâ€™t worry too much about organizing all the feedback. Collect it and use it as a research library when developing new features. Try to spot trends. Use feedback, even complaints, as an opportunity to get to know your users and ask them to explain why they want a specific feature so you find out their needs. Solve the problem â€“ donâ€™t just build the feature.</p><h3>Scope issues to be as small as possible</h3><p>It's hard to see visible progress when working on large tasks, which can be demotivating. Break down work into smaller parts and create an issue for each one when possible. Ideally you can complete several concrete tasks each week. It feels great to mark issues as done.</p><h3>Measure progress with actual work</h3><p>The clearest way to see whether something is complete or not is to show the diff in the code or design file. When the tasks are scoped small, your changes will be small and easier to review, too. Avoid massive pull requests or large design changes.</p><h3>Run cross-functional teams</h3><p>Designers and engineers should work together on projects, creating a natural push and pull. Designers bring their skills to explore ideas and push your team's thinking. Engineers can challenge thinking around implementation and will bring the winning ideas to reality. The best creators often have talent for both. Directly loop in other teams when building features they'll use or ask customers they interact with to use.</p><h3>Write a changelog</h3><p>Itâ€™s important to look back and celebrate what you achieved as a team. Consistent changelogs also communicate to the user new features, the value they get from your product, and your commitment to improving it. It's also an easy way to connect your team's individual work to the collective value they create.<!-- --> <a href="https://medium.com/linear-app/startups-write-changelogs-c6a1d2ff4820">Read more</a> on how we write ours.</p></section></div></div>]]>

    <h3 id="why-am-i-doing-this-to-myself">Why am I doing this to myself?</h3>
<p>I really like taking notes. Notes are an extension of my stupid brain, which can’t remember a <em>damn</em> thing on its own. All these notes were being stored on Google’s servers, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seem like</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best</a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea</a>. And it wasn’t just notes. Pictures, videos, miscellaneous files, I was giving it all to Google for free.</p>
<p>Since my notes contain <em>my bad ideas, and they are <strong>my</strong> bad ideas alone</em>, I wanted to take back control of my data. After researching ways to do such a thing (through the Google search engine of course), my best option seemed to be a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud server</a>.</p>
<p>Nextcloud has all the niceties of a Google Drive or Dropbox, but you host it yourself on your own hardware, and no one’s allowed to snoop. This sounded great! This’ll be so easy! I’ll get this running in just a couple minutes!</p>
<p>Maybe you guessed it from the length of this article, but… this was not the case. Building and setting up this server was a nightmare hellhole, and I’m here today to share my hell with you, the reader, for free!</p>
<p>This isn’t so much a guide or tutorial - more just me explaining (and venting about) the massive effort it took to set this damn thing up. I hope somebody someday learns something from my suffering, or is maybe just entertained.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h3>
<p>I had been interested in doing <em>something, anything at all</em>, with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> for a while, so this was my excuse. Beyond that, I just followed <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/build-a-raspberry-pi-nas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this great article from a Pi magazine</a> for my hardware choices. If you’re wondering what hardware I used, look there. I copied it exactly. Plus, c’mon, look how cute everything looks stacked up like that! A literal “stack”! Ha!</p>
<p><img src="https://acolannino.io/blog/how-i-struggled-to-build-a-nextcloud-server-and-won/nextbox.png" alt="nextbox"></p>
<p>One part the guide doesn’t explain very well was the “USB powered hub” - both why you need one, and what that actually is. Is it a hub powered by USB? A USB powered by a “hub”? What is a “hub”? Maybe it seems obvious to you, and maybe I was just sleep deprived at the time, but I was having trouble wrapping my smooth brain around this concept.</p>
<p>Turns out, the USB hub is simply needed to provide power to the two hard drives, rather than the power going to the Pi <em>and</em> the drives. I have no idea if this was really necessary, but it makes me feel 10% more confident my drives won’t crap out at any moment, and that helps me go to sleep at night.</p>
<h3 id="raid-1-or-whatever-that-means">RAID 1, or whatever that means</h3>
<p>Here I was, all ready to go in fulfilling my long-held dream of running my own little server. Then my stupid coworker comes in, and asks “hey, what if your drive fails? what will you do then?” and ruins all of my fun.</p>
<p>He tells me I should do “RAID”, which is apparently all the rage. RAID stands for “Redundant, Awesome… I dunno”, and was invented on a whim by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID#History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some random nerds in the 80’s</a>. To attempt to give an actual explanation: Using a RAID 1 setup means you get data redundancy, as it will constantly mirror the drives. If one drive craps out, the other drive will still have all the same data, so you just replace the broken one and go about your day as normal. The downside of RAID 1 is you’re getting half the storage capacity that you paid for, but I figured 1 terabyte was large enough to store plenty of memes.</p>
<p>Setting up the RAID array was by far the most pain-free part of the process. Actually, it was the <em>only</em> pain-free part, the rest was pure suffering. I recommend doing this for fun if you’re bored on a Friday evening. It’s cathartic, and the only part of this whole thing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVqcxarP9J4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just worked</a>.</p>
<p>All I had to do was run some cute little commands from the guide, and I was golden. I didn’t fully understand the intricacies of everything I was doing, and the command-line interfaces for some of these programs were absolutely wild (press ‘n’ for a new partition, and ‘p’ for a “primary partition”? Really <code>fdisk</code>? Does this make you happy?), but other than that, it was all smooth sailing.</p>
<p>I should note - no one on the internet really cared to explain how a RAID setup should work with Nextcloud. Eventually I figured this out - the RAID array is seen by the OS as one device, so just politely ask Nextcloud to use that instead of the SD card. I ended up having to <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/issues/general_troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-data-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create a symlink from Nextcloud’s data directory to a directory on my RAID device</a>, but this wasn’t the worst thing I had to suffer through.</p>
<h3 id="big-pixel-energy-destroys-my-wifi">Big Pixel Energy destroys my WiFi</h3>
<p>So here I am, all proud and happy of my brand new Raspberry Pi running a fresh <del>Raspbian</del> Raspberry Pi OS. As I was setting up the RAID array, downloading lots of cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNIX-style utilities</a>, the WiFi starts to cut in-and-out. This has been a problem on my other main machines ever since I switched them to Linux, so I figured it was the <em>mysterious Intel WiFi+bluetooth death bug</em> plaguing me on yet another machine.</p>
<p>I did some more digging, and found what I believe to be the truth (or, as close as <em>I’ll</em> ever get to the truth). There appears to be a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=247982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widely reported problem with the Pi 4</a> where the signals coming out from the HDMI (which are shaped like squares?) are the same frequency(?) as the WiFi. So, if your display resolution is pumped up high enough, and that HDMI is cranking out lots of square signals, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1514642&amp;sid=b811be4b798c7ab50d7626c691b5cc26#p1514642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the WiFi gets totally borked</a>. Neat.</p>
<p>This is clearly absurd, and I hate it. Hardware is bad, and everyone saying “programmers gotta learn hardware too!!!” should get off my lawn. At first I started following the internet’s advice to simply “lower your screen resolution so the WiFi goes fast”, but this became tiring on the eyes (especially with the added problem of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=250534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being able to use redshift on the Pi</a>).</p>
<p>Even though I was reluctant to at first, eventually I started controlling my Pi via an SSH terminal from another machine to avoid this problem entirely. Boy oh boy, was this a joyful discovery. Not only was I freed from whatever stupid resolution the WiFi demanded, but I could also use my beloved blue-light filter to prevent my retinas from burning up. Sure, I had no GUI, but learning to do everything through the terminal came easily enough, and once I got there, I felt like some kind of computer wiz-kid.</p>
<h3 id="the-installation">The installation</h3>
<p>After the RAID was set up and I got SSH going, it was time to install Nextcloud. This proved to be shockingly difficult. There can’t just be a little <code>sudo apt install nextcloud</code> action, no no no no no. You need to install each little bit yourself, by hand, and glue every piece together (<code>nextcloud</code> isn’t even in the apt repository, of course you have to download / unpack something called a “tarball” yourself).</p>
<h4 id="attempt-1-snap">Attempt 1: Snap!</h4>
<p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap</a> is Canonical’s (maker of Ubuntu) locked-down little sandbox for Linux apps. The word “container” is thrown around when describing it, and I have no idea if that’s correct, but I sure as heck wouldn’t recommend the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/nextcloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Nextcloud snap</a>.</p>
<p>The major selling point of snap is that it bundles together an application’s dependencies, so it will <em>just work</em> on any Linux distribution. This sounds great! Sign me up! I’m lazy and hate installing my own dependencies! Who the heck wants to do that? Shell scripts, that’s who.</p>
<p>Problem is, this doesn’t <em>really</em> work on every distro, and in fact, it doesn’t work on the latest Raspberry Pi OS. Do I know why? No. The Nextcloud snap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-silent_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed silently</a> before starting up, and it was too shy to tell me why. Cool.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-2-some-shell-scripts-i-found">Attempt 2: Some shell scripts I found</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was still committed to being a lazy jerk. There’s no way in heck I would manually install <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#prerequisites-for-manual-installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30-something php modules</a> by hand. So, I found a <a href="https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flashy looking site that claimed to have the scripts for me</a>. It didn’t work. The script took multiple runs to actually complete itself, and after the 5th or so attempt, it seemed happy. I went to the web GUI, told it to “initialize”, and it kinda hung out there for a while. I went to take a walk, and when I came back and it was still pretending to initialize.</p>
<p>I found another <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official-sounding shell script</a>, in a last-ditch attempt at being lazy. At least this script had the courage to fail immediately, as it’s <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/master/nextcloud_install_production.sh/#L83" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardcoded to only work specifically on Ubuntu 20.04</a>. Would have been real nice if it had told me that up-front, but hey, I’m not the one going through the trouble of writing all these (failing) shell scripts.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-3-the-hard-way">Attempt 3: The hard way</h4>
<p>Being lazy clearly wasn’t going so well. By now several days had passed, and all I had to show for myself was a whole terabyte of nothing. Worse yet, the shell scripts I ran had spread their little tentacles all over my pure OS install, so I knew I’d have trouble in the future if I left all that cruft in-place. I decided to re-image my OS, and that I would repeat the RAID setup once I got Nextcloud going.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended installation</a> wants you to install and hook each bit up together yourself. This approach made some sense as I learned (sort of, vaguely) more about how Nextcloud works - It’s running on a webserver directly on your machine, handling all the networking and whatnot, with a full-on SQL database and lots of PHP magic happening too. So, it’s understandable that Nextcloud has to spread it’s mischievous claws in each and every crevice of your OS.</p>
<p>I followed the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud documentation</a>, which sure does exist. In their defense, all of their software is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free and open</a>, including the docs, so I could have submitted any number of changes, and yet here I am selfishly writing this blog. The worst part of this process was the aforementioned php modules, which had to be installed one-by-one, and had mismatched names compared to the Debian repository. I had these all installed after about an hour, and I remember listening to a podcast in the background while suffering through it.</p>
<p>After <code>apt install</code>ing every module (seriously, why doesn’t php have it’s own package manager?!), then gliding through the initialization of Nextcloud with <code>occ</code>, my server was working. The <em>Nextcloud Hub</em> web interface greeted me with the most pleasant design and animations I had seen in quite some time. <strong>It was over. I had won.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all, I sure did have a time. The admin page still won’t stop whining about a …</p></div></div>

<h4>To keep track of how a project has been changing through time is key to provide a big picture of what things have been changing and why. After all, the business logic or the domain required those changes to be recorded. Read this to know why it is important to keep an eye on a project’s history.</h4>

<h2>Become a Git Historian</h2>
<p>This is chapter 2 of a series of blog posts about some pieces of advice, tools, and tips you can consider when you arrive at a Rails project considered as Legacy.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html">previous chapter</a>, we reviewed our project’s anatomy.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and other tools related to it to find out more about our Rails Legacy System. But this time, it’s our project’s history turn.</p>
<p>First, I want us to understand ‘<strong>history</strong>‘ as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The whole series of past events connected with someone or something”.
</p></blockquote>
<p>When speaking about history in a Rails project, it’s really important to check <em>how</em> our project has changed through time to get an idea of why things have been modified. Some of those adjustments were maybe done based on business logic, or maybe the domain required those changes.</p>
<p>Maybe, other changes happened because someone followed a particular path —which is a normal thing if you consider that every project is different and that there are infinite factors that can affect it in a positive or in a negative way.</p>
<span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url&amp;text=In%20Software%20Development%2C%20a%20legacy%20system%20is%20outdated%20computing%20software%20that%20is%20still%20in%20use.&amp;via=weareMagmaLabs&amp;related=weareMagmaLabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In Software Development, a legacy system is outdated computing software that is still in use. </a></span><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url&amp;text=In%20Software%20Development%2C%20a%20legacy%20system%20is%20outdated%20computing%20software%20that%20is%20still%20in%20use.&amp;via=weareMagmaLabs&amp;related=weareMagmaLabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click To Tweet</a></span>
<p>In Software Development, a legacy system is outdated computing software that is still in use. That system still meets the needs it was originally designed for but doesn’t allow growth. What a legacy system does now for the project is all it will ever do. A legacy system’s older technology won’t allow it to interact with newer systems.</p>
<h2>Git extras</h2>
<p>To get a general summary of things about the project, like repo age, the number of commits, and who the people involved are we could use <a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><code>git-extras</code></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><code>git-extras</code></a> has many interesting features that you can explore and use to get a better understanding of your project.</p>
<h3>Git log</h3>
<p>Ok, now let’s understand how <em>change</em> on single objects works with <code>git log</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --patch --stat Gemfile

<p>As you can see, it will show why a specific update was made. Or, maybe it will just trigger more questions. But, at least you will be closer to your main goal, which is “understand what was the purpose of those changes”.</p>
<h3>Git History</h3>
<p>Also, if you prefer the fancy way and see the timeline of a particular file, you can try <code>git-history</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s use <a href="https://github.com/pomber/git-history">git-history</a>, which is like a visual time machine where you can visually review any change on a specific file and understand its timeline.</p>

<p>Check this <a href="https://githistory.xyz/webdevtalks/www/blob/master/Gemfile">example</a> out.</p>
<h3>Look for Documentation (we’re using Git as well)</h3>
<p>As we look for documentation keep in mind and ask yourself the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any documentation at all?</li>
<li>Is there good commentary on the code?</li>
<li>Do the names of things make sense?</li>
<li>Are the System Use Cases documented?</li>
<li>Is there someone in the team that understands the system?</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use <code>git whatchange doc</code> to see logs and differences in our documentation, check the example above:</p>
<pre><code>$ git whatchanged doc
commit e43e0fecfb5914ec0e72eadff73e90c0e14c7026
Author: Daniel Contreras &lt;daniel.country.club@magmalabs.io&gt;
Date:   Thu Jan 28 19:32:35 2016 -0500

    Render diagram inline. Use AsciiDoc for the table of contents.

:100644 100644 13fa6c9d4 ff7935d08 R055 doc/client-system/README.md     doc/client-system/README.adoc
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that we have a doc folder. 🎉🎉🎉 It also seems like the last time a document was modified was in 2016, so it’s time to start documenting your new progress. That would help you in the future, and any other developer that joins the team.</p>
<h3>Extra: The README</h3>
<p>There is a README?  Well, yes. But it is so poor…</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5432" data-permalink="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html/readme_template" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=2032%2C490" data-orig-size="2032,490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="README_Template" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=300%2C72" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=1024%2C247" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1424%2C343" alt="" width="1424" height="343" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=300%2C72 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=200%2C48 200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=768%2C185 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1024%2C247 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1200%2C289 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=860%2C207 860w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=680%2C164 680w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=400%2C96 400w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=50%2C12 50w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Hey, but don’t worry, there are many templates you can use; like this <a href="https://github.com/dbader/readme-template" rel="noopener" target="_blank">example</a>.</p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>Here are more things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document everything you learn.</li>
<li>Keep documentation close to the code, simple is better.</li>
<li>You must understand the design/architecture.</li>
<li>Once you understand something, refine its documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find this blogpost compelling. In the following chapter, we are going to cover some nice toolings for static analysis of your code.</p>

          <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Did you ever dream about creating your own chip?
I mean, a physical chip.
One which you can hold in your hand, and which does exactly what you’ve designed it to do?</p>

<p>Until today, there were two major road blocks: you had to get access to a process design kit (PDK) from a chip manufacturing house (a foundry), and you had to have enough money to actually pay for the manufacturing.
These times are over.
Today.</p>

<p>Today, in a FOSSi Dial-Up talk, Tim Ansell of Google announced <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">SkyWater PDK</a>, the first manufacturable, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit">process design kit</a>.
What differentiates this PDK from previous attempts is the fact that it is manufacturable: with this PDK, you can actually produce chips with the <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/">SkyWater foundry</a> in the 130nm node.</p>

<p>That leaves you as chip designer only with one road block: money.
Manufacturing chips is expensive – even for more than a decade old nodes like the 130nm node, you need to spend at least a couple thousand dollars.</p>

<p>You know what?
Don’t worry – Google and efabless have got you covered!
They are providing <strong>completely free of cost</strong> chip manufacturing runs: one in November this year, and multiple more in 2021.
All open source chip designs qualify, no further strings attached!</p>

<p>Learn more about all of that by re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EczW2IWdnOM">Tim’s Dial-Up talk</a> or click through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtwZPc8ykkkgtUkHkoJZrP9jKOo3FYdKqbg-So0ic6_kx7ha1vHnxrWmuxWkTc9GfC8xl0TfEpMLwK/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">slides</a>.</p>

<p>This is certainly a dream come true for us at the FOSSi Foundation.
We helped the Free and Open Source Silicon community, our community, grow and tackle huge challenges over the years.
An open, manufacturable PDK was the main blocker in a fully open flow between RTL and a physical chip, and we’re extremely excited to see that blocker removed.</p>

<p>As always, removing one roadblock only highlights more challenges:
RAM, ROM and flash compilers, analog blocks, optimizations to various tools, and much, much more.
Now is the perfect time to get involved in the Free and Open Source Silicon ecosystem – or learn more about the accomplishments and challenges ahead of us.
A good starting point are the next Dial-Up talks.</p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/dial-up/">Dial-Up web site</a> for a listing of the upcoming talks on OpenROAD, cell design, OpenRAM, and Magic, an old, but surprisingly up-to-date tool!

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的<a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/#chinese-version-below">读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Last weekend, I read <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/360061.html">a long, epic piece of techlore</a> that chronicled the fierce and bitter rivalry between TSMC and Samsung in their fight to become the world’s number 1 chip foundry, which stretched back three decades and continues today.</p><p>Among the many dramatic details was the “Nightingale program” that TSMC started in the mid-2010s to jumpstart its R&amp;D, because it was falling behind Samsung and losing Apple’s A9 chip orders to the Korean conglomerate. TSMC conceived of a three-shift, 24-hour non-stop R&amp;D operation, taking a page out of their fellow Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth Foxconn’s assembly operation. The “Nightingales” were engineers and researchers, who were willing to work the “graveyard shift” for a 30% increase in base salary and 50% increase in dividend payout. Due to this program, <strong>the total working hours clocked in Taiwan in 2014 was 2135</strong>, apparently the most of any economy in the world that year.</p><p>TSMC, and arguably Taiwan’s entire economy, was confronting an existential struggle at that time. SMIC (the largest chip foundry in China), and arguably China’s technological and economic future, is confronting a similarly existential struggle on a larger scale.</p><p>There are many interconnected elements that, when put together, could determine how China will come out on the other end of this struggle -- <strong>RISC-V, foundry technology, the “New Infrastructure” stimulus program, open source, and a few key TSMC personnels</strong>, who are now at the helm of China’s semiconductor industry.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each of them, sequentially and interconnectedly.</p><h2 id="risc-v-strengths-and-weaknesses">RISC-V: Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p>The conversation around China’s journey towards technological self-reliance often involves <strong>RISC-V</strong> -- an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware that’s under open source licenses, thus any one can run, change, copy, and distribute it, in accordance with<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"> the four freedoms</a> of open source.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sVMZ8L3CA61u_kc0hdRdB9AItYEuK65vUJ70os7CAaFpogycLyqhYL_BbwMndKktijiEAF8Bi9WLyKCmW5ztmGE3Zhw2dQrRP0VwWcxWIsUqTFVFfYXIS4K5wp_SDExCRiug0cE1" alt=""><figcaption>RISC-V Ecosystem, courtesy of SiFive.</figcaption></figure><p>However, RISC-V is still young. Its<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/"> user-space ISA</a> and<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/"> privileged ISA</a> wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for large-scale software and hardware development, until June 2019. The technology and community ecosystem is maturing, and support from large Chinese organizations has a lot to do with it. Of <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">the six Premier Members</a> of the official RISC-V foundation, RISC-V International, &nbsp;four are Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>But in the near future (say the next five years), what can RISC-V, the technology, realistically enable China to accomplish?</p><p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> &nbsp;RISC-V is a very good foundation for rapidly prototyping and building <strong>special purpose</strong> chips. The development cycle and experience feels closer to software than hardware. This speed in development is partly because it’s open-sourced -- no hassle in getting a commercial license, as oppose to its proprietary counterparts like ARM -- and also partly because the ISA itself is simplified and “reduced” (i.e. the R in RISC), as opposed to CISC (the C means “complex”) which underpins more powerful, proprietary ISAs like Intel’s x86. This reduced architecture enables and optimizes simple computation instructions well, literally elementary school math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It’s less capable of supporting complex mathematical operations, like matrix multiplication and partial derivative (used widely in Deep Learning AI).</p><p>Thus, in reality, chips designed using RISC-V have been used most commonly in <strong>IoT and embedded systems</strong> scenarios. Because of its simplicity and malleability, RISC-V chips also <strong>tend to have low power consumption</strong>, which is a good attribute when battery life is an issue, e.g. wearable devices. This reduced simplicity also means that the compiler (the software layer that translates code, like C, into machine instructions for a chip to execute) does not need to be purposefully designed to optimize performance on RISC-V. Using some common compilers <a href="https://riscv.org/software-status/#c-compilers-and-libraries">like GCC, which RISC-V </a>supports, will do.</p><p><strong>What does it lack? </strong>As you might’ve guessed, RISC-V’s reduced simplicity is also the source of its limitations. While many people like to pit RISC-V against a general purpose ISAs, like Intel’s, <strong>they are more compliments than competitors. </strong>In fact, special purpose RISC-V chips that accelerate certain computations for AI workloads do run side-by-side along general purpose Intel chips in the cloud. It’ll be a long time (more than five years, in my opinion) before RISC-V can enable the design of a <strong>general purpose</strong> chip that powers our iPhones, laptops, or cloud computing servers in a data center, with enough developers incentivized to both extend the ISA and the compiler and other infrastructure software on top of it.</p><p><strong>Can RISC-V become general purpose some day?</strong> Of course. <strong>But that’s not an inevitability</strong>. It’s <strong>a strategic choice</strong> that the RISC-V community can make and work towards, with all the complexity in upstream coordination, developer community building, and open governance, not to mention the work of building the technology itself, that must be executed collectively. That possible future is perhaps the most interesting question when we think about China’s self-reliance, which I’ll discuss in more detail below <strong>in the context of fostering open source</strong>.</p><h2 id="-new-infrastructure-">“New Infrastructure”</h2><p>With the strengths and weaknesses of RISC-V in mind, let’s see where RISC-V chips could get deployed in China’s economy and infrastructure in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It’s no secret that central government industrial policy matters a lot in China, even though its market-driven economy is what materializes much of that vision. The most relevant piece of policy is <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-04/22/content_75961988.htm">the “New Infrastructure” spending plan </a>that came out of the National Development and Reform Commission, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy. This infrastructure stimulus plan sits in a larger context of two other long-term strategic plans: Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035.</p><p>The details of this “New Infrastructure” plan have emerged in the last couple months, with major emphasis in IT and digital infrastructure, not just traditional infrastructure like highways and railroads. As it often happens in China, the signals sent from the top have already shifted private investment dollars. Nascent chip startups, all of a sudden, are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-analysis/sino-u-s-tech-race-turbo-charges-china-chip-investment-triggering-bubble-fear-idUKKBN23V3CO">enjoying investor attention and bubbly valuations</a>.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the “New Infrastructure” sectors that I think RISC-V could play an immediate role in, given its strengths:</p><ul><li>IoT</li><li>Smart transportation</li><li>New energy vehicle chargers</li><li>Limited AI (specific workloads that need customized acceleration)</li><li>Autonomous vehicles (limited to certain types of sensors and data collection)</li></ul><p>And as for sectors that I don’t see RISC-V making much of a dent, given its current limitations:</p><ul><li>Cloud computing</li><li>5G (both base station construction and consumer devices)</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Data centers</li><li>Big data</li><li>Large-scale AI training and production deployment</li></ul><p>As you can see, RISC-V impact would be limited,<strong> but not insignificant</strong>. The logical next step would be for China to help evolve RISC-V <strong>into a more general purpose ISA</strong>, and reduce its reliance on proprietary solutions from ARM or Intel that could always be subjected to more sanctions.</p><p>The path to that end would have to be fostering open source <strong>and doing it the right way.</strong></p><h2 id="fostering-open-source-the-right-way">Fostering Open Source, the Right Way</h2><p>Open source has been popping up in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qcze4R-7zL2wjMh_DNVCIQ">a lot of discussions</a> in various Chinese technical and R&amp;D communities, triggered in particular by MATLAB being now off-limit to Chinese universities that are on the U.S. export control entity list. The discussion inevitably leads to open source: are there open source alternatives to MATLAB? What about CAD softwares, like EDA tools, which every chip foundry needs? Will there be an open source EDA option?</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a predominant “takers” mentality towards open source. In China, open source solutions are mostly seen as “free stuff” that you can take and use, without any expectation or incentive to give back (or in open source parlance: “contribute upstream”).</p><p>It’s already happening in RISC-V. Alibaba <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date</a>, but there’s no intention to my knowledge for the design to also be open-sourced or at least publicly shared for the benefit of the ecosystem. Many small startups in China, now showered with new investments, are doing the same -- using RISC-V to make special purpose chips that are effectively proprietary.</p><p><em>(This is not to generalize that all Chinese organizations are bad open source players; some are contributing a lot and have open source in their DNA. I’ve profiled many of the big tech firms and some startups from the lens in Part II of my “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/"><em>Open Source in China</em></a><em>” series.)</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> China hopes to evolve RISC-V into a more powerful, general-purpose building block to achieve semiconductor self-reliance, Chinese organizations, both individually and collectively, would have to shift from a zero-sum “takers” mentality to a positive-sum “stakeholders” mentality. What that means in reality is absorbing and practicing the open source way of doing things -- not just contributing code upstream and being more willing to share, but also behaviors like transparent governance, open discussions with other stakeholders and developers, and clear due process for decision-making, big and small. <strong>These are both technical and human complexities.</strong></p><p>With an existential struggle at hand, there’s reason to believe that Chinese companies may behave differently for the sake of achieving a national imperative and be less concerned about the tit-for-tat, zero-sum nature of market competition, which is quite cutthroat in China. And<strong> if done right</strong>, RISC-V could unleash massive technological innovation broadly and help China deal with its existential struggle specifically.</p><h2 id="foundries-smic-hsmc">Foundries: SMIC, HSMC</h2><p>Let’…</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Nowadays, political, social, and technological environments are evolving rapidly. Such changes create further risks and opportunities that may severely influence the way a company operates. For instance, as North American and European countries entered in lock down to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, several organizations were forced to make the move to remote working, despite not being prepared for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These massive disruptions have led some organizations to go under, while others fundamentally reinvented their operations to meet their strategic goals. In face of recent challenges, several companies have discovered that they need to be resilient, adaptive, and responsive. All such qualities serve as founding pillars to the Agile methodology, which has become increasingly attractive to companies by promoting faster deployment times and resilient workforces that are flexible and adaptive in the face of challenges and changes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguably, a department that is in need of change in many organizations given recent and prior events is human resources (HR). HR is a key pillar in balancing organizational needs with employee’s priorities, helping to build, operate and foster incentive mechanisms and culture. Conversely, decisions made in areas such as prospecting, training, salary, and career development can heavily impact employee motivation and productivity. This incredibly delicate package can directly translate into a company’s ability to meet its strategic goals such as profitability, market share, productivity and sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, the HR department was governed by stiff protocols that were meant to instil policy alignment, control, and facilitate vertical structures. This style, often criticized as an obstacle to innovative thinking and resilient teams, has been under scrutiny by the business community in recent years. To bring human resources into the digital age, Agile has been identified by some as an ideal solution to create the right incentives necessary to ensure company success, even if partially implemented – Agile Lite (<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-new-rules-of-talent-management#hr-goes-agile">HR Goes Agile</a>, HBR).</p></div></div></div><div data-id="48430811" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Agile Driven Trends in HR</h2></p></div><div data-id="169f41f3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbeknownst to them, some companies have already started to implement Agile practices across their organization, while others have knowingly deployed Agile teams to test the waters. Nevertheless, in many well managed environments, such experiments have proven to be fruitful and have given way to innovative thinking and behaviour.</p></div></div><div data-id="62a25b3e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>External Talent Acquisition: Reactive vs. Proactive</h3></p></div><div data-id="5fb1805d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, the modus operandi for bringing new talent was, and still is in most enterprises, reactionary: as positions were made available, a formal search process started, from which a pool of applicants was formed. Once the ideal candidate was identified from the pool of applicants, an incentive package was negotiated and, finally, necessary organizational training was given. This talent acquisition style has its benefits as it ensures that the organization follows controls and policies, however, it can be very time consuming and not necessarily attract or select the best candidate for the position.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agility driven talent acquisition practices understand the power that a company’s culture has to attract the right personnel. An agile talent acquisition staff becomes less reactive and more proactive in its operational handling. This means that the person is more in tune with the needs of their organization to appropriately forecast personnel needs – this can be done by maintaining a relationship with managers, understanding the turnover ratios on each department, and being attuned to the company’s demographics and needs (ex: what employees are expected to retire soon?).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By understanding the organization’s internal environment, talent acquisition members are then able to cultivate relationships across multiple channels (ex: LinkedIn and Universities) and expedite the hiring process should a position become available. It is important to note that this practice does not enforce or condone direct hiring. In fact, it is still advised that talent acquisition staff invite desired candidates to participate in formal hiring processes and, if all boxes are checked, then make an offer to the most qualified individual.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="2166be74" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Internal Talent Acquisition: Gigs and Projects</h3></p></div><div data-id="400b0a9" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inevitably, as organizations’ needs and challenges change, new projects with differing or novel set of skills may appear. Depending on the complexity of the task, consultants or new talent may be brought in. However, for small and short-term projects, the procurement process for new talent or an agency may become too costly, or even risky. In some cases, the skills necessary to fulfill the project may be found in-house. Some forward looking, agility driven organizations have increased their workforce productivity by assigning short-term projects to employees with downtime. For example, should one department require assistance with the automation of a report, they may post the assignment in a board so other members of the company can apply to fulfill the request.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such practice has been implemented by the <a href="https://www.cppinvestments.com/">CPP Investment Board</a> and they call it <a href="https://cdn3.cppinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cpp-investments-annual-report-2020-en.pdf">Gigs</a> (optional short-term assignments). Similar internal talent utilization may prove to be beneficial on several levels:</p><ul><li>It can further collaboration and a sense of community within the organization, which further strengthens corporate culture.</li><li>It can serve as a new challenge for employees who may find themselves underwhelmed by their current routine and wish to spice things up.</li><li>It may assist employees to acquire professional experience of skills that they previously viewed as hobbies (ex: graphical design or photography).</li><li>It may serve to further augment and sediment skills acquired through internal or external courses.</li><li>It can support an employee’s transition into a new career.</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="2578c15a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Talent Management: Workforce Upskilling</h3></p></div><div data-id="1b44a92c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conventional talent management practices are typically owned by HR and focus on assigning static training for individuals who are preparing for new roles, are underperforming, or need to achieve a specific performance level in a desired practice (<a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/applying_agile_practices_HR/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20HR%20Trend,workforce%20fluctuations%20to%20demand%2C%20and">GSA</a>). This practice alone may not encourage innovative and proactive behaviour among the workforce and can even hurt engagement levels.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, with technological advances in the are of online learning, Agility driven talent management practices are openly facilitated by HR to any employee who wishes to learn or hone a new skill. As such, internal learning portals are available (or the company has the choice to partner with institutions who offer such service) for employees to choose from a vast selection of topics which can be suggested to them according to identified best practices, or can be selected by them independent of their job. Agility driven HR has also found itself with a lot of untapped data that can be harnessed to drive personalized training. Technology is evolving at a rapid pace, causing organizations to consider workforce upskilling as a major driver in the digital age. HR departments that fail to transition at pace, or faster than its competitors may find itself scrambling compete.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="5131c56b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Agile Framework Adapted to HR</h2></p></div><div data-id="2825630a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially, Agile was a work methodology destined for software development. However, as time passed, other teams and departments started to retrofit its framework to their operations in the hopes of achieving similar results such as higher productivity, engagement, and efficiency. As explained in our previous article from the Agile series, <a href="https://gpetrium.com/agile-sales-department/">The Agile Sales Department</a>, Agile teams have 4 distinct roles: the team lead (in Scrum, also known as Scrum Master), team member, product owner, and stakeholder. Additionally, Agile practices are surrounded by ceremonies that instill team collaboration, autonomy and ownership to reach mutual objectives. Below, let us discuss how roles and ceremonies can both be adapted to further the HR department’s goals and objectives.</p></div></div><div data-id="460bba18" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The HR Manager</u></strong> is usually tasked with many of the product owner activities. It can range from setting the vision for the team (alongside stakeholders such as Senior HR Manager and Managing Directors), setting priorities, anticipating stakeholder’s needs, overseeing progress, creating key strategic decisions and team targets. At the end of the cycle (or sprint), the HR manager will review the team’s progress and provide relevant guidance for future cycles. Although priorities may differ depending on the company and team, one of the key objectives in this role should be to provide targets and guidance for their HR team depending on their priorities – be it for the compensation team, benefits team, talent management and more.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Team Facilitator/ Coordinator</u></strong> serves as an intermediator who encourages the team to be the best they can be (balancing time, cost, and quality), while facilitating meetings, managing stakeholders, reinforcing objective oriented actions, and supporting team introspection. The team facilitator is also tasked with shielding the team from internal and external challenges that are not relevant to the current cycle’s objectives. This role is incredibly powerful even more so in organization who are testing the implementation of agile teams by introducing a few teams per department or project.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Team Members</u></strong> are a group of 3-8 individuals, excluding the hr manager and the team facilitator.

<p>(Not that there’s an unofficial one anywhere, but yeah…)</p>



<p>After around 3 years of silence, Trailblazer is back with its 2.1 release. Lots of improvements on the core gems come hand-in-hand with a quite flat migration path, so don’t ya worry! We’re also proud to tell you all about our new upcoming projects in this post, as well as communicating a looot of background about what’s been going on in those past few years.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick summary for those who want to get back to coding.</p>

<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-good-to-see-you-again-">Good to see you, again!</h3>


<p>It almost feels unreal finishing up this release post. It’s been so long! The work put into Trailblazer 2.1 has been tremendous, it could easily have been TRB 3.0, or even TRB III, since Roman version numbering turns out to be quite a fancy thing to do. However, as much as the internals have been improved, as little has changed on the public APIs of Trailblazer, so we decided to go with a minor release.</p>

<p>With the introduction of another new callback <code>after_save_commit</code> in Rails 6 it becomes obvious that we do have a problem in software engineering: how do we structure business code? We do have a few dozen database abstractions in every language, well written and designed, but, yeah, how do I structure the actual code of my domain, of my application’s needs? What’s the best way to put together application functions, put them in order, prevent other functions from being executed when it’s not the time, and so on?</p>

<p>Trailblazer is an architectural style coming as a framework to implement our patterns, trying to answer that one question: “How do I implement business processes?”. It gives you strong conventions along with patterns to structure your code flow better, handle errors, and integrate those components into bigger flows - or <em>processes</em>.</p>

<p>Having said that, I let you decide whether or not you join the ride! There is nothing wrong with building your own “service layer”, and many companies have left the Traiblazer track in the past years due to problems they had and that we think we now fixed.</p>

<p>Speaking of problems, the craziness of the past years working on Trailblazer 2.1 can be visualized with the following screenshot.</p>

<p><img src="https://trailblazer.to/images//2.1/blog-subl.png"></p>

<p>Very often, in order to fix one function <em>A</em> in a commercial app, I had to rewire a track in the <code>endpoint</code> gem, which would only work if I add another DSL option in the <code>dsl</code> gem, which couldn’t work straight away because the normalizer in the <code>context</code> gem needed to be extended, which was only possible if you could finally extract the start event via the <code>activity</code> gem whose test suite was currently broken because I needed to document feature <code>x</code> first, which couldn’t be documented because before I had to allow dynamic params in the <code>macro</code> gem and… I think you got my point.</p>

<p>Luckily, I got help from a band of great people, I took it easy on the conference front, and for some other reasons I still don’t understand all this is now finished and here’s TRB 2.1.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-about-the-design">About the Design</h3>


<p>A big change from TRB 1.1 and even 2.0 is that we apply functional principles in most places. We barely keep state in instance variables. Rather, data is passed around from operation to operation, from step to step. We use OOP and inheritance solely for compile-time configuration. You define classes, steps, tracks and flows, inherit those, customize them using Ruby’s built-in mechanics, but this all happens at compile-time. At runtime, no structures are changed anymore, your code is executed dynamically but only the <code>ctx</code> (formerly <code>options</code>) and its objects are mutated. This massively improves the code quality and with it, the runtime stability, which Ruby is famous for *cough.</p>

<p>I extracted a lot of smaller libraries from the original <code>trailblazer</code> gem. Most gems use the <code>activity</code> gem itself, which is the core of an operation and provides the runtime object that executes your steps in a certain order. It’s so simple that I sometimes wonder why it took years to develop it! But all those little interfaces, structures and principles that you see as “common sense”, they took a while to figure out.</p>

<p>A lot of work went into the <code>dsl-linear</code> gem that provides a DSL to create activities (or operations) using your old friend <code>#step</code>. It’s not even a DSL since it doesn’t create code at run-time, it doesn’t even create code: it creates runtime objects, <em>activities</em>, that are executed when your operation is run. You could create those objects manually without the DSL, or even write your own DSL, which we’re hoping for!</p>

<p>So, whenever you hear the medieval argument “Trailblazer is just a nasty DSL!”, forgive your opponent, you now know better. The entire framework is based on small, clean Ruby structures that can be executed programmatically.</p>

<p>Also, the more I <em>use</em> Trailblazer in projects or even in Trailblazer itself, I feel how needed those new abstractions are. Yes, you can write everything with your own code, you don’t need abstractions for flow control and automatic error handling, which makes me wonder why you’re not programming in assembler since Ruby is also an “unnecessary abstraction” on top of a processor. We need abstractions, unless you want to program like we did 30 years ago.</p>

<p>Ok, enough of this - let’s jump into the things that actually help you.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-loader-startup-speed">Loader / Startup Speed</h3>


<p>Startup speed and loading of operations has been a never-ending problem.</p>

<p>To make it short: we returned to the <em>Rails Way™</em>, lowering our heads in shame, and adhere to the Rails file and class naming structure for <em>operations</em>. What used to be named <code>Memo::Create</code> is now <code>Memo::Operation::Create</code>, which reflects its file location <code>concepts/memo/operation/create.rb</code> (still the same!) and works with Rails’ autoloading.</p>

<p>The big benefit is: we could remove the <code>trailblazer-loader</code> gem. The alternative loader was a naive attempt by me to combine “our” naming style with the Rails file structure. After endless fire-fighting against broken development reloading, inconsistencies, slow startup times in develpment mode, more incompatibilities with Rails’ autoloader and some clarifying discussions with the great <a href="https://github.com/fxn">Xavier Noria</a> himself (author of Rails loading and zeitwerk), we ditched our loading mechanism.</p>

<p>If you want to take advantage of the fast server startup times and (almost) seamless hot reloading of classes, you need to <a href="https://trailblazer.to/2.1/docs/trailblazer.html#trailblazer-rails-loader-loader-with-rails">rename your operations</a>.</p>

<p>This change is not super dramatic at all, given that in the future, you won’t be calling operations yourself all too much anymore. With the upcoming <code>workflow</code> and <code>endpoint</code> gems, those abstractions will invoke the business logic for you, so don’t worry too much.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-new-website">New website</h3>


<p>In case you haven’t noticed: you are reading this release blog post on a newly designed website! Not only does it come with the most beautiful, romantic and inspiring <a href="https://trailblazer.to/2.1/">hero backdrop ever</a> (featuring a James-Cameron-worthy parallax effect, too!), it also attempts to provide all the old documentation while bringing you the hottest off-the-press docs for our new gems.</p>

<p><img src="https://trailblazer.to/images//2.1/blog-lp-hero.png"></p>

<p>We try to keep the “information architecture” - a word I wouldn’t have learned without the inspiring <a href="https://github.com/myabc">Alex Coles</a> - as simple as possible: so far, we got a handful of pages accessible through the top navigation, and then the documentation behind the <a href="https://trailblazer.to/2.1/2.1/docs/trailblazer.html">DOCS</a> link. Here, the right sidebar helps you to navigate within the chapter.</p>

<p><img src="https://trailblazer.to/images//2.1/blog-documentation.png"></p>

<p>After all, we’re a nerdy developer’s library and don’t need no million hipster landing pages! One is more than enough and took months of collaboration between us, the design and web team in Argentina and our awesome comic artist <a href="http://www.joshbauman.com/">Josh Bauman</a> who also drew the epic <a href="https://leanpub.com/trailblazer">Trailblazer book</a> illustrations in 2016.</p>

<p>The documentation has been designed to make coherent information as quickly accessible as possible. We even added a search feature - something our beloved user base has asked for many times. Just hit the <code>/</code> key (or <code>Shift+7</code>) in the docs.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes">API CHANGES</h3>


<p>The new 2.1 version comes with a few necessary but reasonable changes in method signatures. As painful as that might sound to your Rails-spoiled ears, we preferred to fix design mistakes now before dragging them on forever.</p>



<ul>
    <li>API CHANGES</li>
    <li id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes-new-call-api">New call API</li>
</ul>

<p>In versions before 2.1, the automatic merging of the <code>params</code> part and the additional options was confusing many new users and an unnecessary step.</p>

<pre><code># old style
result = Memo::Create.(params, "current_user" =&gt; current_user)
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument (<code>params</code>) was merged into the second argument using the key <code>"params"</code>. You now pass one hash to <code>call</code> and hence do the merging yourself.</p>

<pre><code># new style
result = Memo::Operation::Create.(params: params, current_user: current_use )
</code></pre>

<p>Your steps use the existing API, and everything here is as it used to be before.</p>

<pre><code>class Memo::Operation::Create &lt; Trailblazer::Operation
  step :create_model

  def create_model(options, params:, **)
    # ..
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The new <code>call</code> API is much more consistent and takes away another thing we kept explaining to new users - an indicator for a flawed API. Believe it or not, but not a single time has this topic come up again on our <a href="https://trailblazer.zulipchat.com/">support forum</a>.</p>



<ul>
    <li>API CHANGES</li>
    <li id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes-symbol-keys-for-ctx">Symbol keys for ctx</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>ctx</code> (or <code>options</code>) object now behaves like a <code>HashWithIndifferentAccess</code>, a pattern used for Rails’ <code>params</code> object. In other words, you can now access <code>ctx[:current_user]</code> instead of <code>ctx["current_user"]</code> and conveniently use the keyword argument version of it, too.</p>

<p>Another handy addition to <code>ctx</code> is aliasing. Before 2.1, you had to refer to, say, the main contract via <code>ctx["contract.default"]</code>. While I designed that name “back in the …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>JavaScript has no security model. The runtime environments do. This post is a primer on how to think about JavaScript code security in Web browsers and Node.js.</p><p>JavaScript was created to add interactivity to HTML pages. Web browsers were the first runtime environment for JavaScript code.</p><p>When the user visits a Web page, the browser downloads the HTML code of that page and parses it to create the Document Object Model (DOM). The HTML contains information about other assets that need to be downloaded to render the page to the user. This includes stylesheets (CSS), images, other documents to display in frames, and many more.</p><p>The type of asset we are most interested in here is JavaScript code. It is also downloaded by the browser from locations referenced in the HTML.</p><h2 id="same-origin-policy">Same-Origin Policy</h2><p>Users can simultaneously visit many pages in tabs or separate browser windows. JavaScript code downloaded from multiple different sites is executed in the same browser.</p><p>One of those sites could be infected or operated by an attacker. Is this a risk? Could malicious code compromise the machine or steal data from other sites the user is browsing?</p><p>Browsers protect against this. Each Web site executes JavaScript code in a sandbox. Code downloaded from one Web site cannot read or write data from another site. It also cannot call functions or methods across different sites.</p><p>This is called the <a href="https://web.dev/same-origin-policy/">Same-origin policy</a> (SOP) and it is one of the most fundamental security policies on the Web.</p><h2 id="protecting-code-integrity">Protecting Code Integrity</h2><p>Attackers could breach the SOP through the injection of malicious code at the network level, making the injected code appear as coming from the legitimate site. Browsers use the <a href="https://web.dev/why-https-matters/">secure HTTPS protocol</a> to ensure JavaScript code is downloaded from the legitimate server and that the code is not tampered with in transit.</p><p>JavaScript is often distributed using Content Delivery Networks (CDN). Attackers capable of injecting content into the CDN could also compromise the SOP. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a> (SRI) provides an additional level of protection that allows HTML code to be cryptographically bound to JavaScript code to prevent this.</p><p>Sandboxing is difficult to implement. Browsers use isolation mechanisms provided by the hardware and the operating system. JavaScript code from different sites is executed in separate processes.</p><p>The code in a sandbox is restricted in what it can do. It cannot directly access devices such as webcams or microphones. The filesystem and the local network are also not directly available.</p><p>JavaScript can use those resources only through very limited APIs. This reduces the attack surface. It also allows the browser to always ask the user for explicit permission before uploading files, capturing the webcam, or listening to the user’s microphone.</p><p>Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript based on the V8 engine built for the Google Chrome browser. It allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of the browser, typically on servers.</p><p>Node.js does not use the browser sandbox to run JavaScript. Security properties of both execution environments are different:</p><ul><li><strong>Origin</strong>. Browsers download the code and Node.js loads the code from local files like other popular programming languages.</li><li><strong>Trust</strong>. Browsers treat the code as untrusted and Node.js treats the code with full trust.</li><li><strong>Permissions</strong>. Browsers restrict capabilities the code has access to and Node.js grants all the privileges of the operating system account. This includes access to devices, files, and the local network.<br>Impact on Security</li></ul><p>The same JavaScript script or module can be executed in the browser or Node.js. Potential attacks may be different in both environments. The impact of successful exploits may be drastically different. It is very hard to reason about the security of JavaScript code without a specific execution environment in mind.</p><h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2><p>A successful attack on JavaScript code running in the browser impacts a single user. The impact is limited to what the sandbox, browser APIs, and the user’s explicit consent allow for.</p><p>Compromised JavaScript script or module runs within the context of an authenticated session of the victim and it can perform actions on behalf of the user. In this scenario, the vulnerable code becomes an attack vector against Web applications the victim has legitimate access to.</p><h2 id="node-js">Node.js</h2><p>A successful attack on Node.js programs may impact the entire server the program runs on. The attacker may get access to all the resources the operating system account has access to, potentially leading to a full compromise of the server.</p><p>The next post in this series will demonstrate how the dynamic type system may lead to subtle security bugs.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<h6 id="2020-07-02">2020-07-02</h6>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Here I will do some basic analysis of the data provided by 
Y-Combinator's social news site, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> (HN).
The analysis presented here is a light hearted meandering through different
aspects of the HN site data.
I've favored an approach that leaves the data interpretation up to the reader
and kept my own interpretation to a minimum.</p>
<p>Doing a search for a snapshot of the HN API data provided some options but nothing
recent and nothing with user information also present, at least, not that I could find.
I decided to scrape what was available from the HN data through their very
nice <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a> and do some rudimentary analysis.</p>
<p>To get a copy of the database to play around with yourself, a snapshot
has been provided as a SQLite file along with the compressed 'raw' JSON files on <a href="https://archive.org/details/HackerNews-Data-2020-06-28">Archive.org</a>.
The raw data is about 3.6Gb compressed and the SQLite file is 5G compressed and 13G uncompressed.</p>
<p>All source code, unless otherwise stated, as well as text and other data, is provided
under a CC0/public domain license.
The Hacker News itself is proprietary and so please check with with the
<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/legal/#tou">Terms of Use</a>.
I am, no doubt, violating their terms of use so I'm hoping they won't sue me
or take down the data as I'm providing it in the hacker friendly spirit of
data sharing and transparency.</p>
<p>There's nothing novel here, aside, maybe, from an easily downloadable database.</p>
<p>That being said, I imagine a lot of people thinking "so what?" and I'd be hard pressed
to argue with them.</p>
<p>So what? So what! Why not! Let's take a look at Hacker News data!</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>First let's get an overview of the data:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(*) from users;

</code></pre>

<p>A breakdown of different types of item data:</p>

<p><img alt="type vs time" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/type-mo-ts.png"></p>
<h4 id="user-item-frequency">User Item Frequency</h4>
<p>How about the frequency of user item creating (polls, comments, stories, etc.), making sure to filter out blank <code>by</code> fields:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(id) c, by from item where by != '' group by by order by c desc;
c|by
51639|tptacek
40333|jacquesm
39999|dang
34255|rbanffy
33216|dragonwriter
31837|pjmlp
25573|coldtea
24766|TeMPOraL
24666|DanBC
22665|icebraining
...
</code></pre>

<p>Either because my SQL knowledge is substandard or I don't know what I'm doing with the indexes, I found queries took too long in SQL.
Parsing the JSON directly yields faster results for me.</p>
<p>After some data munging, we get: </p>
<pre><code>zcat $datadir/hn-item*.ajson.gz | \
  jq -r -c '.by ' | \
  grep -P -v '^$' | \
  grep -P -v '^null$' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -nr | \
  sed 's/^ *//' &gt; user_item_freq.gp
cut -f1 -d' ' user_item_freq.gp | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -nr | \
  sed 's/^ *//'  | \
  awk '{ print $2, $1; }' &gt; user_item_freq_freq.gp
./zipf-mle user_item_freq.gp &gt; user_item-exponent-mle.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at a log-log plot of the graph:</p>
<p><img alt="user item frequency" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/user-item-freq.png"></p>
<p>Ah! The tell-tale sign of a power law distribution.</p>
<p>Here it is broken out by <code>story</code> and <code>comment</code> items:</p>
<p><img alt="user story/comment frequency" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/sc-freq.png"></p>
<p>The y-axis being the number of users which have that frequency of item creation and the x-axis is the number of
items created.
For example, you can see <code>tptacek</code> far out on the right, being the only user to have 51639 items created, whereas
users that only have 1 comment, say, are much more frequent.
For context, I'm at 224 item creation (comments and stories combined) and fall in the middle.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/11/24/estimating-the-exponent-of-discrete-power-law-data/">John D. Cook</a> we can copy-pasta
the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) code to give us a value of 1.58 for the exponent for all items, 1.54 for comments and 1.77 for stories.
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution">a sanity check</a>, they all fall in the range of <code>(1,3)</code>, which is expected
for fat-tailed distributions.</p>
<p>What does it mean? I dunno <code>-\_(:|)_/-</code></p>
<h4 id="user-urls">User URLs</h4>
<p>Let's take a look at the common URLs in the <code>about</code> field from the users on HN.
Getting URLs from the <code>about</code> field in the <code>users</code> table is difficult to do in vanilla SQLite3 syntax, so excuse
the bash incantation:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo 'select about from users where about like "%https:%";' ) | \
  sed 's/&amp;#x2F;/\//g' | \
  grep -o -P 'https?://[a-zA-Z0-9\.-]*' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -rn 
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="User URLs" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/user-url.png"></p>
<p>Please note the log-scale of frequency.</p>
<p>One thing that jumps out is the prevalence of <code>keybase.io</code>.
I can only assume that Y-Combinator has some close relationship to <code>keybase.io</code>, maybe going to far as
insisting folks going through their program use it.</p>
<p>Another point of note is the high occurrence of sites like <code>hackernewsers.com</code>.
An unkind interpretation would be that some folks are trying to game the HN system
to give a signal boost to their site.</p>
<p>Note that this analysis counts subdomains as separate URLs.
I don't want to get too far into the weeds with this analysis but your own
could include better handling and binning of URLs like <code>github.io</code> or <code>tumblr.com</code> sites.</p>
<h4 id="item-frequency-by-time">Item Frequency by Time</h4>
<p>Let's start with looking at activity of stories and comments during the day.
So we're not deluged by extraneous data, let's just take data from Jan 1st 2020 (unixtime <code>1577854800</code>):</p>
<pre><code>echo 'select substr(datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc"), 12, 5) t from item where time &gt;= 1577854800 and time != "" ;' | \
  sqlite3 hn.sqlite | \
  tr ':' ' ' | \
  awk '{ print ($1 &lt; 10)? ($1+24 + $2/(60)) : ($1+$2/60), $3; }' | \
  sort -n 
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="UTC Time of Day Item" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/item-tod-unshifted.png"></p>
<p>Whoa! Seems like a pretty clear signal.</p>
<p>Let's shift so we see the trend with a bit more clarity:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'select substr(datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc"), 12, 5) t from item where time &gt;= 1577854800 and time != "" ;' | \
  sqlite3 hn.sqlite | \
  tr ':' ' ' | \
  awk '{ print ($1 &lt; 10)? ($1+24 + $2/(60)) : ($1+$2/60), $3; }' | \
  sort -n 
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="UTC Time of Day Item shifted" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/item-tod.png"></p>
<p>16:00 UTC is 09:00 AM PT, so I would guess HN is pretty (US) west coast centric with the majority of activity happening
at the start of the business day.</p>
<p>I wouldn't guess any big surprises, but let's split it out by stories and comments:</p>
<p><img alt="UTC story and comment ToD" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/sc-tod.png"></p>
<p>Note that the story submissions are much less prevalent than comments and are plotted with different Y axies.</p>
<p>It should be obvious but I only realized this in retrospect from looking at the data that comments have a lag
behind stories, for probably obvious reasons.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's see if we can pick out any weekend effects.</p>
<pre><code>echo -e '.separator " "\nselect strftime("%w", datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc")), substr(datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc"), 12, 5), type from item where time &gt; 1577854800 and time != "";' | \
  sqlite3 hn.sqlite &gt; item-tow.raw
grep -P ' (comment|story)$' item-tow.raw | \
  cut -f1,2 -d' ' | \
  sort  | \
  uniq -c | \
  sed 's/^ *//' | \
  tr ':' ' ' | \
  awk '{ print $2 + ($3/24) + ($4/(24*60)), $1; }' | \
  sort -n
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="item time of week" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/item-tow.png"></p>
<p>Again, no big surprises.</p>
<p>Here, 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday (the results of using <code>%w</code> in <code>strftime</code>) and times are in UTC properly rescaled.</p>
<p>I would guess most people interact with HN during the weekday and peter off on the weekends, with Sunday being the least active day.</p>
<h4 id="story-word-clouds">Story Word Clouds</h4>
<p>Let's look at a trigram word cloud for stories in 2019 and 2020 (so far):</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo "select title  from item where type = 'story' and score &gt; 30 and score != '' and substr(datetime(time, 'unixepoch', 'utc'), 1,4) = '2019' and time &gt;= 1546318800 order by id desc;" ) | \
  ./trigrams | \
  iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//translit | \
  tr ',-.:!'"'"'"' '_'  &gt; 2019-filtered.trigrams
./plot-wordcloud 2019-filtered.trigrams hn-2019-trigram.png
sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo "select title  from item where type = 'story' and score &gt; 30 and score != '' and substr(datetime(time, 'unixepoch', 'utc'), 1,4) = '2020' and time &gt;= 1577854800 order by id desc;" ) | \
  ./trigrams | \
  iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//translit | \
  tr ',-.:!'"'"'"' '_'  &gt; 2020-filtered.trigrams
./plot-wordcloud 2020-filtered.trigrams hn-2020-trigram.png
</code></pre>

<p>2019:</p>
<p><img alt="HN 2019 Trigrams" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/hn-2019-trigram.png"> </p>
<p>2020 (so far):</p>
<p><img alt="HN 2020 Trigrams" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/hn-2020-trigram.png"></p>
<p>Please excuse the underscores I'm being lazy and constructing "single" words by concatenating three words together
to fool <a href="https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/">amueller/word_cloud</a> into constructing the word cloud.</p>
<p>Note that these are for stories that have a score of more than 30.
The mangling of the title might also have an effect, so take care to not read too much into the word cloud.
Also note that I don't think there's a way to really get at what stories were on the front page with this data
so that might skew interpretation.</p>
<p>You can also see some topical subjects from 2019, like the Hong Kong protests, the Boeing 737 and Raspberry Pi 4.
I guess the take away is there's a lot of 'ask' and 'show' stories that are popular.
I would interpret this as the community tends to like posts that they can actively engage in.
It'll be a cute meta-analysis to see if this post lands on the front page of HN ;).</p>
<p>I picked tri-grams pretty arbitrarily.
Single words and bi-grams don't really provide enough information to be interesting to me.
Tri-grams look to have just enough interesting information to at least give the illusion
of insight before being drowned out by the combinatorial explosion of choices.</p>
<h4 id="story-topic-modeling">Story Topic Modeling</h4>
<p>Engaging in some more tea leaf reading, we can do some <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php">topic modeling</a>.
Topic modelling is new to me but I discovered it
from the excellent <a href="https://greg.blog/2013/01/26/unix-bi-grams-tri-grams-and-topic-modeling/">blog post on using UNIX for Bi/Tri-Grams</a>.</p>
<p>Running a query against 2020 HN stories (so far):</p>

They allow you to link a remote database to PostgreSQL and represent it as a set of foreign tables that behave like normal ones.</p><p>Imagine being able to run SQL on a MongoDB collection or querying MySQL data from your PostgreSQL instance. Or, imagine running a <code>JOIN</code> between an SQLite file and an Oracle cluster without having to write and maintain an ETL job.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss PostgreSQL foreign data wrappers and how <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/">Splitgraph</a> makes it much easier for anyone to use them.</p></section><section><h2 id="using-a-custom-fdw-with-splitgraph">Using a custom FDW with Splitgraph</h2><p>This example (<a href="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw" as="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw">source code on GitHub</a>) will show you how to write a custom <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">foreign data wrapper</a> using Multicorn. <a href="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn" as="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn">Multicorn</a> is a PostgreSQL extension that makes it possible to write foreign data wrappers in Python.</p><p>We will then integrate it with Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command.

</span></code></pre></section></section><section><h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers">What are foreign data wrappers?</h2><p>The easiest way to describe foreign data wrappers is by considering UNIX files. A UNIX file isn't always pointing to a local file on your disk. It could be a file stored on NFS, in a remote S3 bucket or even a shim that lets you manipulate a device on your machine.</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a pretty strong abstraction that doesn't get broken. An IDE doesn't need to know that the file it's editing is on a remote filesystem. It can work with it by issuing the same ordinary read and write calls. Someone who writes a new filesystem doesn't need to make sure that it's compatible with all existing tools. Instead, they can write a driver that mounts the filesystem to a mountpoint.</p><p>PostgreSQL FDWs resemble mounting in that respect. Foreign tables mostly behave like normal tables and can receive the same <code>SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE</code> queries. Behind the scenes, the wrapper's only job is to emit tuples.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-should-i-use-fdws">Why should I use FDWs?</h2><p>Foreign data wrappers are a great alternative to ETL. Instead of loading data into your warehouse that you might never use, you can mount the remote database and query it on demand.</p><p>Because they integrate with the PostgreSQL query planner, FDWs have a decent performance. The FDW can push down qualifiers and even aggregations to the remote database. FDWs can report the rough costs of starting a scan and fetching a tuple back to the query planner. This lets the query planner choose, for example, whether running multiple small single scans or one big one is a better strategy for satisfying a JOIN.</p><p>It's straightforward to write your own FDW and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html" as="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> covers it extensively. The <a href="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/" as="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/">hello-world FDW</a> that returns "Hello, World" in a table is only a couple hundred lines of C code. If you prefer to focus on development simplicity, you can use Multicorn instead of raw C.</p><p>There are plenty of open-source foreign data wrappers available. They let you query other RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, CSV files or column stores. The <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers" as="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">PostgreSQL wiki</a> lists some of them.</p><p>Using a foreign data wrapper for your database or data source gives you access to a huge ecosystem of software that works with PostgreSQL. We can almost call this a network effect. A new data source that is accessible via an FDW enhances everything that works with PostgreSQL.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-use-fdws-with-splitgraph">Why use FDWs with Splitgraph?</h2><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">Foreign data wrappers</a> are one of the ways that Splitgraph aims to make data engineers' and data scientists' work easier.</p><p>Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command handles the boilerplate around FDW initialization.

      <p>Recently I received an invite to the GitHub Sponsors program so I figured I’d make a sponsorship page. Building <a href="https://github.com/users/giuseppeg/sponsorship">my sponsorship profile</a> was fun!</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/711311/66648695-78bed800-ec2c-11e9-8cf3-6a46c5bd3511.jpeg" alt="">
<figcaption>My Sponsorship Profile.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Having to define dontation tiers was an interesting exercise because I had to figure out reasons that would convince (will they?) people that the donation is worth it somehow. What can I offer in my spare time? What are supporters getting in return? Is it valuable?</p>

<h2 id="will-it-work">Will it work?</h2>

<p>Getting people to donate is a very hard thing to do, and it is definitely harder for those who are no influencers because they lack visibility.</p>

<p>Not to mention that asking for a donation feels a bit like asking strangers on the street for money, maybe for a service that you deliver to somebody else. 🙃</p>

<p><del>Overall, I have a job and I am lucky enough to not have to rely on OSS funding to make a living</del>. <a href="https://giuseppegurgone.com/hire-me">I am available for hire</a>. I work on side projects and OSS at random times and for fun, so much so that I started a (very WIP) personal <a href="https://github.com/giuseppeg/contributing">Open Source Contributor Manifesto and Policies</a> to communicate this to others.</p>

<p>If you want to pursuit the OSS funding path my recommendation would be to invest in personal branding first.</p>

<div>

</blockquote> 
</div>

<p><strong>Update</strong> to date I have <strong>0</strong> sponsors. Clearly I haven’t worked on marketing and none of my projects is that valuable, yet I get a constant stream of issues/PRs.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-donation-based-systems">Alternatives to donation-based systems</h2>

<p>GitHub Sponsors and donation based platforms are great for some, but ultimately I think that the path to OSS sustainability is to reward developers based on usage stats (installs or consumers/licenses) or provide services around OSS.</p>

<p>For example I have this tiny project that has 24k downloads a month. In this space it is nothing but nonetheless it is definitely providing value to some. How could this translate to a few bucks? 🤷‍♂️</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/711311/66648696-78bed800-ec2c-11e9-81b2-1ba89b4cf668.png" alt="">
<figcaption>Non-profitable OSS with 24k monthly download.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="services">Services</h3>

<p>The more I observe the OSS space, the more I think that the only real way to make OSS sustainable is to build services around it and sell those instead of the software itself.</p>

<p>Focusing on providing services has proven to be working well for many companies.</p>

<p>On the other end this means that individual contributors are now required to build a business to sustain their work on the actual code and not every developer is a business person.</p>

<h3 id="paid-packages">Paid Packages</h3>

<p>A very controversial solution that I have had in mind for a while is <em>paid packages</em>.</p>

<p>Library owners could make a buck from every user of their library by integrating with a centralized service that would require customers to provide a license token (in the form of environment variable) when they install a library. When users haven’t paid for the library, the install would fail.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ PAID_PACKAGES_TOKEN</span><span>=</span>123 pip <span>install</span> &lt;package-name&gt;
🔴 PAID PACKAGES: Error
   &lt;package-name&gt; is a paid package.
   In order to use it please donate <span>$1</span> a month to it.
https://paidpackages.io/support/package-name</code></pre></figure>

<p>Core members of packages (maintainers) would do revenue sharing or collect funds under an organization. Occasional contributors would either get some kind of credit or get to use the library for free.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="https://github.com/giuseppeg/paid-packages">more about this idea on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="support-and-training">Support and Training</h3>

<p>Selling support and training are probably other viable options for people who want to live off of Open Source Software. I doubt that this is a viable option for the ones who work on OSS in their spare time. The tough truth is that <strong>many OSS contributors have a full time job</strong>!</p>

<h3 id="getting-hired">Getting Hired</h3>

<p>There are companies that use and produce Open Source Software all the time. An example are ZEIT or Gatsby. Getting a job at such companies could potentially mean that you wouldn’t have to work on OSS in your spare time anymore.</p>

<h3 id="crowdfunding">Crowdfunding</h3>

<p>Starting a campaign on crowfunding sites could be a good way to boostrap FOSS development.</p>

<p>A successful example of this model is <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prosemirror/">ProseMirror’s campaign on Indiegogo</a>. They managed to raise $50000 to support the development of the project.</p>

<h3 id="npm-inc">npm Inc.</h3>

<p>npm Inc. is in a unique position because they own the biggest and most popular package registry and because they don’t yet provide a service to package owners for monetizing their software.</p>

<p>I really hope that they are monitoring the donation based space and eventually will come up with a better solution for everybody (even the small <em>fish</em>) that is <strong>not yet another donation based platform</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> forget this, <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-15-npm-has-joined-github">npm has been acquired by GitHub</a> :)</p>

<h3 id="a-success-story">A Success Story</h3>

<p>If you want to read about a success story check this out <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it</a>.</p>

<p>My takeaway from it is that eventually you end up becoming a marketer more than a developer but I guess that’s part of the game 🤷‍♂️</p>

<![CDATA[Python pattern matching: Guards and or-patterns might just not compose well]]>

<br/>
July 2, 2020 | https://ncik-roberts.github.io/posts/pep622.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ncik-roberts.github.io/posts/pep622.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      

      

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/">PEP 622</a> proposes adding a pattern matching construct to Python. Pattern matching allows the programmer to destructure data with a syntax that mirrors the construction syntax. The proposal brings Python in-line with many other modern programming languages, like Haskell, OCaml, and Rust. However, two features included in the proposal (or-patterns and guards) interact in a perhaps surprising way—see <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01413241/document">this paper</a> for an explanation of this interaction as it relates to OCaml, another language with both or-patterns and guards.</p>

<p>You can try out an in-progress implementation of this PEP at this fork of cpython: <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma">https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma</a>.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post, I’ll briefly summarize pattern matching, define or-patterns and guards, and show the surprising behavior in the context of Python.</p>

<h2 id="example-of-pattern-matching">Example of pattern matching</h2>

<p>Before the proposal, here’s how you might write a function that classifies a pair of animals according to their kind</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Cat</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>age</span>

<span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Cat</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
  <span>elif</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Dog</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>

<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A dog named Fido
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A cat that's 3 years old
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the proposal, this is how you could write <code>classify</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In other words, pattern matching allows you to inspect a piece of data and simultaneously match its shape and bind the value of its fields to variables. In the above code, <code>Cat(age=age)</code> is a <em>pattern</em> that <em>matches</em> <code>Cat</code> values, and <em>binds</em> to the variable named <code>age</code>.</p>

<p>The proposal gives an informal description of the semantics of this construct, but the informal description doesn’t explain the interaction between two of the introduced features: or-patterns, and pattern guards. As it turns out, as currently implemented, the interaction between these features is somewhat surprising, and will probably yield at least one high-scoring Stack Overflow question if this PEP ends up being accepted.</p>

<h2 id="or-patterns">Or-patterns</h2>

<p>Here is an example of an or-pattern: <code>Cat(age=3) | Dog(name="Fido")</code>. This pattern matches either three-year-old cats or dogs named Fido. In practice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># I have a three-year-old cat and a dog named Fido.
# This function returns true if the pet could be mine.
</span><span>def</span> <span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>):</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Rover"</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="pattern-guards">Pattern guards</h2>

<p>Pattern guards are boolean expressions that can be included in a <code>case</code> branch; the case branch is only taken if the pattern guard evaluates to true.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>age</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"This cat has an even age!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"This dog's name is in alphabetical order!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"I have nothing interesting to say about this pet."</span><span>)</span>

<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "This cat has an even age!"
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"abe"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "This dog's name is in alphabetical order!"
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"fido"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "I have nothing interesting to say about this pet."
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above example, <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> and <code>if sorted(name) == list(name)</code> are pattern guards that allow that case to be taken only if that boolean expression evaluates to True.</p>

<h2 id="the-surprising-interaction">The surprising interaction</h2>

<p>What do you think this function does?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>pet1</span><span>,</span> <span>pet2</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>pet1</span><span>,</span> <span>pet2</span><span>):</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>),</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>))</span> <span>if</span> <span>age</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False (?????)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last one (<code>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code>) may seem like it should evaluate to True. After all, the one of the patterns in the or-pattern seems like it matches the second cat, which is a cat with an even age.</p>

<p>Does <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> match against <code>(Cat(age=age), _) | (_, Cat(age=age)) if age % 2 == 0</code>? To answer this question, the semantics in your head might look something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Well, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> does match agains the first pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(Cat(age=age), _)</code>. This match binds the value 5 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now we check the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code>. Because <code>5 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to False, this check fails.</li>
  <li>Go back to the or-pattern and see if there’s any other way to match it. In this case, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> also matches the second pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(_, Cat(age=age)</code>. This binds the value 4 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> succeeds, because <code>4 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>.</li>
  <li>Because this case matches the value, we return True.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is perfectly sensible, but this is not what the implementation does. The implementation’s semantics are more like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Same as step 1 from above.</li>
  <li>Same as step 2 from above.</li>
  <li>Because the guard failed, the case isn’t taken! Instead, the next case is tried. This case (<code>case _:</code>) always succeeds, so we return False.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, pattern matching does’t have backtracking semantics, even if a value can match an or-pattern in multiple different ways.</p>

<p>I love pattern matching, and I’m excited to see that it might be adopted by such a popular language as Python. But this particular interaction of features might confuse novices. Let’s compare the approaches of other languages.</p>

<p>OCaml has the same semantics as Python here, but the OCaml compiler can emit a warning (because the compiler has enough type information to figure out whether the constituent patterns of an or-pattern can possibly match the same value in different ways).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>with</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>when</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":)"</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":("</span>
<span>;;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prints <code>:(</code>, but also emits the warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Warning 57: Ambiguous or-pattern variables under guard;
variable x may match different arguments. (See manual section 9.5)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rust has pattern matching and guards, and has an experimental <code>or_patterns</code> feature. It implements backtracking semantics, unlike Python. This is weird in its own right, especially in the presence of side effects. Take a look at this program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(or_patterns)]</span>

<span>// Prompt the user whether they want to accept the match</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>io</span><span>::{</span><span>stdin</span><span>};</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Checking this match: {}. Should we accept it? y/n"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In particular, the guard can now run multiple times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo +nightly run
Checking this match: 1. Should we accept it? y/n
n
Checking this match: 2. Should we accept it? y/n
y
:)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m not sure what the right decision is for Python. Or-patterns and guards may just not compose well.</p>

<p>This summer we were due to hold our XT20 conference, which was going to focus on
how we could bring some of the approaches of the past to tackle the challenges
of the present and the future. Unfortunately, one of these future challenges
arrived, and we had to make the difficult decision to cancel the event.</p>
<p>Alan Kay was one of the leading researchers at the legendary labs of ARPA and
Xerox PARC in the 1960s and 1970s. We wanted to understand from Alan how Xerox
PARC came to be, and how could possibly reproduce what happened there, to make
similar leaps for our industry in the future.</p>
<p>When we held our XT16 conference, we made short videos with all of our speakers
to introduce their talks, and we wanted to continue this tradition with XT20. So
prior to the cancellation, we recorded a short piece with Alan to introduce the
content of his talk.</p>
<p>Alan stresses that we’re only just at the start of our industry and
that we’ve a long way to go. As he puts it, many of great ideas from
the 1960s and 1970s are still landing, before we consider the new
ground-breaking ideas that are yet to be found. To find those ideas,
we need to seek out the brightest among us, and then we have to figure
out how to fund and manage them properly.</p>
<div>
<p>
<iframe width="300" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6Ly4gSfAoo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>I got asked to give a talk at XT20 because I was one of the researchers and a
leader of a research group in the ARPA and Xerox combined research community in
the sixties and the seventies that invented many of the technologies that are in
use today including the ones that we’re using right now, these include: Personal
Computing; The Graphic User Interface; Ethernet; The Internet; Laser Printing;
Client/Server computing, and a host of other ones.</p>
<p>And so this was not just a series of inventions but was actually the creation of
several really large industries that have, according to the Wall St. Journal,
have returned about 45 trillion (US dollars) to the world, and the four largest
capital net-worth companies in America all used, are based on, these
technologies, so besides being good ideas, besides being something that can
boost human intellect and can deal with much more complicated situations, it
also has been a tremendous commercial success far beyond normal R&amp;D efforts.</p>
<p>One point of interest, I think, to people is that despite this, <strong>no country or
company or Univerisity is willing to fund such an effort!</strong>. The key is: can you
get the right people, and can you set up something that allows the researchers
and the right researchers to do the kind of stuff that normally was only done
when countries felt that they were in the middle of a war.</p>
<p>That’s the second point, there have been many such efforts, successful efforts,
such as ARPA and Xerox PARC in the past, especially in the US, and the Cold War,
and then back in WWII, and the particular way of going about it actually traces
back to the combined joint work of the UK and the US in developing Radar for
WWII. There’s a direct link in the methodologies used back then, and to an
extent in projects that are not so directly involved such as Bletchley Park (in
the UK) and Los Alamos and the Atomic Bomb effort (in the US).</p>
<p>So I think what will be of interest to the people who go to this conference will
likely be the idea first that it really can be done, and <em>has</em> been done (more
than once).</p>
<p>Most normal regular people are quite against taking what seems to be a huge risk
but in fact, the pay-off from these risks, which is actually only been a few
hundred million (GB) pounds or so, has been in the trillions!</p>
<p>So if you count up all the zeros the return on investment is not 15% but more like 20,000%,
so it actually would make good business sense for people to take these kinds of
risks, but that isn’t the way business people think. And so this is, I think, a
really interesting area to explore and that’s what I will at least open the
door to in my talk.</p>

<p>2020.06.04</p>
<p>updated: 2020.06.06</p>



<p>
  This write-up outlines some of the implementation details of the
  <a href="http://github.com/rxi/lite">lite</a> text editor. At the time of writing
  this lite is version <a href="https://github.com/rxi/lite/releases/tag/v1.06">1.06</a>.
</p>


<p>
  Lite is written mainly in Lua (5.2) with the lowest level parts written in C.
  It is written with the intent of being lightweight, easy on the eyes,
  responsive and trivial to modify and extend. To achieve this the core
  implementation aims to be <em>as simple as possible</em>: complexity is only
  brought in when it's proven the simplest method isn't practical.
</p>



<p>
  The core of lite implements documents, syntax highlighting, a
  cooperative-threading system, basic logging and the general ui layout system.
  Overall the core is in charge of handling user input, running per-frame tasks,
  and rendering the resultant frame early enough to meet the frames-per-second
  specified in <code>config.fps</code>.
</p>



<p>
  Lite implements a cooperative-threading system where by background tasks —
  such as full-document syntax highlighting and updating the internal list of
  project files — can be performed incrementally. Cooperative threads in lite are
  implemented using lua's coroutines and are referred internally as simply
  <code>threads</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A thread can be started by using the <code>core.add_thread()</code> function, this
  function takes a function, and an optional object which is used as a weak
  reference to that thread, eg. if a doc is passed as the weak reference, when
  that doc is garbage collected the coinciding thread will also cease to exist.
</p>
<p>
  As threads in lite are cooperative they're expected to regularly call
  <code>couroutine.yield()</code>. Typically this yielding is done every <code>n</code>
  lines for line-based tasks (eg. full-project search, syntax highlighting).
  When a thread yields the core will continue to render the frame, or — if there is
  still enough time left in the current frame — pass control to another thread.
  Threads can also pass a numerical argument to <code>coroutine.yield()</code> to wait
  for the number of seconds specified:
</p>
<pre>core.add_thread(function()
  -- print "hello world" every 10 seconds
  while true do
    print("hello world")
    coroutine.yield(10)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>
  Practical usage examples of lite's threading can be seen in the core's project
  file scanning (<code>data/core/init.lua</code>) and the incremental syntax highlighting
  (<code>data/core/doc/highlighter.lua</code>).
</p>


<p>
  All loaded text files in lite are stored in <code>Docs</code>. A doc keeps a table
  of a text file's lines (<code>Doc.lines</code>), undo and redo
  state, the current syntax (<code>Doc.syntax</code>), syntax highlighting state
  (<code>Doc.highlighter</code>) and caret/selection state. Docs are opened using the
  <code>core.open_doc()</code> function; if the function is called and a doc of that
  filename is already open then the existing doc is returned such that
  more-than-one doc representing the same file should never be present.
</p>
<p>
  Lite stores all the open docs in the <code>core.docs</code> table; each frame lite
  checks the number of views referencing each doc and releases those with zero
  references — this is an instance of lite favoring polling over callbacks or
  event listeners. This approach is done throughout lite; in avoiding event
  listeners we also avoid having to manage unregistering event handlers or worry
  about having those which are never unregistered through error. This leads to
  much simpler, less error-prone code.
</p>

<p>
  Lite implements a simple syntax highlighter based around lua patterns, this is
  split up into 3 parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>core.syntax</code>: stores language syntax specifications</li>
  <li><code>core.tokenizer</code>: converts text into table of tokens using a given syntax</li>
  <li><code>core.doc.highlighter</code>: stores token state for lines of a doc and handles
         full-document incremental highlighting</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A language syntax is stored as a table of lua patterns mapped to to their
  resultant token type (<code>.patterns</code>) and a table of symbols mapped to their
  token type (<code>.symbols</code>). Patterns in the pattern table can also be a
  range of the following format:
</p>
<pre>{ range_start_pattern, range_end_pattern [, escape_character] }
</pre>
<p>
  Ranges can be used for matching strings:
</p>
<pre>{ '"', '"', '\\' }
</pre>
<p>
  An example of syntax specifications can be seen in any of the
  <code>data/plugins/language_*.lua</code> files.
</p>
<p>
  The highlighter persists range state between lines by storing the pattern
  table index of the current range. As the highlighter works in increments of
  lines, ranges are useful for multi-line comments or strings which a single
  pattern would fail on.
</p>
<p>
  When the <code>tokenizer.tokenize()</code> function is called it iterates the syntax's
  pattern table from top to bottom, such that patterns higher up in the table
  take precedence. When it matches a pattern it pushes the token to the
  resultant table, if the token's content matches any of the keys in the
  <code>.symbols</code> table that value is used instead of the matched token value;
  this acts both as a more convenient way of specifying keywords as well as an
  optimization as the tokenizer can attempt matching fewer patterns, even if
  there are many keywords specified. The function returns a <code>state</code> integer
  which is used to indicate which pattern range it is currently inside if it is
  inside any.
</p>
<p>
  <code>core.doc.highlighter</code> is in charge of providing tokenized lines when
  displaying a document; each doc stores a <code>Highlighter</code> object. The
  highlighter assures highlighting information for any line that is requested
  is <em>always</em> available, even if the full-document incremental highlighter
  has not yet reached that line.
</p>
<p>
  When a request is made to the highlighter for a specific line the highlighter
  first checks its cache for the line; if it does not have the line cached —
  or, if the line's text has changed since its cached version — it immediately
  tokenizes the line, continuing from the tokenizer state left from the
  previous line. The highlighter's <code>max_wanted_line</code> field is set to
  that line's value if it's greater than the existing <code>max_wanted_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A doc's highlighter creates a thread when it's created which it uses to do
  full-document highlighting starting from its <code>first_invalid_line</code> up
  until the <code>max_wanted_line</code>. When a change occurs in a document the
  <code>first_invalid_line</code> is set to the first line of the change if it's
  greater than the current <code>first_invalid_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This implementation results in the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displayed lines are always syntax highlighted with, at the very
         least, highlighting which is valid to the current screen's content</li>
  <li>Displayed lines are <em>eventually</em> highlighted with
         full-document aware highlighting</li>
  <li>The highlighting is performed per-line, and so — with the exception
         of extremely long lines — can be done incrementally without a
         negative effect on responsiveness</li>
  <li>Highlighting is only performed up until the point in the document it
         is required, for example, up until the last visible line</li>
</ul>



<p>
  Each part of lite's UI is implemented as a <code>View</code>, that is, a document is
  shown in the UI as a <code>DocView</code>, the status bar at the bottom the
  <code>StatusView</code> etc. Each view exists within the <code>RootView</code>
  (<code>core.root_view</code>) which is in charge of calling the <code>:update()</code> and
  <code>:draw()</code> functions of each view, managing the layout of the
  views, and routing user input to relevant views.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview is implemented as a binary tree of <code>Nodes</code>. Each node is one
  of the following types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>hsplit</code>: Contains two children side-by-side and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>vsplit</code>: Contains two children one-above-the-other and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>leaf</code>: Contains one or more views, and, if there is more than one
        view, a tab at the top for each view.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each frame the rootview calculates its layout based on the divider position of
  each split and sets the <code>.size</code> field of each node and view accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview also has a concept of <em>locked nodes</em>; the size of a locked
  node is not determined by the divider position but instead is set from the
  view's <code>.size</code> field. Locked nodes cannot be resized by the user as
  normal nodes would be, they cannot be closed and cannot open additional views.
  The locked-node feature is used for, amongst other things, the status bar at the
  bottom of the screen which we typically want to be always present and
  immutable.
</p>
<p>
  lite takes the approach of effectively redrawing <em>everything</em> whenever
  it needs to redraw <em>anything</em>, this lends itself to simplified UI code.
  There are no event listeners or callbacks to manage. If something changes the
  state of the UI (eg. the caret is moved), the <code>core.redraw</code> boolean is set
  to <code>true</code> to signify that something has changed and the UI is redrawn on
  that frame. For further simplicity any user input events will also set
  <code>core.redraw</code>, such that there's a guarantee any change which resulted from
  user input will result in the screen contents being updated.
</p>
<p>
  Although the idea of redrawing everything each time may appear wasteful, lite
  employs a technique where by only regions of the screen which have changed
  between frames are actually redrawn — these regions can be displayed by calling
  <code>renderer.show_debug(true)</code>. This technique is implemented on the C level
  of the code and is invisible to the lua portion which acts as if it's doing
  a full redraw each time.
</p>
<p>
  An overview of how this is achieved is detailed in the
  <a href="https://rxi.github.io/cached_software_rendering.html">Cached Software Rendering</a> write-up.
</p>



<p>
  Lite's plugin system is based around lua's module system; each plugin is
  simply a lua module (that is, a single <code>.lua</code> file, or, a directory
  containing a <code>init.lua</code> file). All modules in the <code>data/plugins</code>
  directory are automatically loaded when lite starts — this is done after
  initializing the core and before loading the user and project modules. Thus to
  install a plugin you simply place the file in the plugins directory; to
  uninstall a plugin you delete the file.
</p>
<p>
  A specific order of which plugins are loaded is not guaranteed by lite but,
  as plugins are just regular lua modules, a plugin can simply call <code>require</code>
  on another plugin if it needs to assure that …</p></div>

<p>When it comes to customer relationships, momentum is on your side: it is much easier to retain a customer than it is to find a new one. Once the initial inertia is surpassed, the effort that needs to be put into keeping a customer is significantly lower than acquiring and onboarding another customer. And a churned customer is a double loss: not only do you have to find a new customer to replace them. To grow, you will need to find two new customers. That’s why customer retention is of utmost importance to grow a business reliably.</p>



<p>This focus on retaining a customer at all costs is somewhat new. Before the subscription economy, a repeat customer was a nice-to-have, but most of the time, the relationship with the customer was over after the first transaction. Processes were optimized to get the customer through the order process and stop them from abandoning their cart. But once they ordered, it was over.</p>



<p>The membership economy is very different. Customer retention is more important than getting new customers, as churn is the silent killer. Retention can be measured in renewal or cancellation rates, and keeping it as close to 100% as possible will decide if your business is sustainable or not.</p>



<p>Luckily, there are several proven strategies to increase retention, and they all center around your relationship with your customers.</p>



<p><strong>Value Nurturing</strong></p>



<p>Value nurturing strategies increase the customer’s perceived value of your product, making the cancellation feel like a more significant loss. Showing your customers how much they benefit from your product will make them stick around longer.</p>



<p>Your goal is to over and over again confirm your customers’ belief that choosing your service was a smart choice. Not only does it have to feel right, but it should also clearly be a good economic decision, both on their first day and right now.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, customers would continuously notice what a fantastic product you provide them with. They would flood your customer service channels with thank you messages, and they would write long blog posts about how everyone should be a customer of your business, forever. Sadly, life gets in the way, and other things are much more important to your customers.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s up to you to show them what they get. Show them their progress, how much they have improved ever since they used your service. Show them how well they do compared to other users, how much impact your service has in their lives. In short: make the value they receive visible to them inside your product and in your communication.</p>



<p>It’s not only limited to this, though. The goal is to retain a customer, and showing them what they get is just one way of keeping them around. You want your product to be something they depend on. When times are tough, you want your service to be the last one to be canceled. This is best accomplished by creating voluntary dependency: offer something that your customers want to depend on. Provide so much value compared to the alternatives that they willingly take the risks inherent in every choice of using an external product.</p>



<p>A word about value: we are not just talking about your revenue here. For your customers to stick around, your business needs to provide them with benefits and advantages every single time they use it. Your customer lifetime value is inextricably linked to the perceived value of your customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the trick to customer success: increasing their revenue will increase yours. Make them successful, help them grow the lifetime value of their customers, and their LTV will expand as well.</p>



<p><strong>Expectation Management</strong></p>



<p>Managing expectations is a significant factor too. Being able to occasionally over-deliver will delight your customers as it is an unexpected bonus. I’m not saying you should consistently undersell your product. But surprising a customer with something good they didn’t expect is a rare occurrence in the business world. Those who succeed at that will be remembered.</p>



<p>Customers will tell a few people about a positive experience, but they will tell a few dozen about a negative one. Keeping customers above the baseline will reduce the chance of them ranting to their peers, who may often be potential customers.</p>



<p>Every impression counts. At any touchpoint, you can synchronize expectations. Find out what your customers are concerned with and adjust your priorities when expectations change. From your customer’s perspective, it’s a magical thing to see a feature suggestion become an actual feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The level of trust in the brand and the decisions you make are incredibly important for renewal. By aligning what your customers expect you to do with your actions, trust grows, and value generation will happen along with the expectations of your customers.</p>



<p>Those expectations change over time. In the beginning, customers often have to find their footing, and they expect ease of use and being able to integrate your product into their workflow. After a few years, focus shifts to perceived value, as your service has become a regular part of your customers’ work routine. Unless they’re really needed, customers will ask less and less for new features, and they will shift their focus onto existing parts of your offer and how the current set of features can be improved even more.</p>



<p>Throughout a customer’s lifetime, get a feel for the acceptance of and desire for self-service in your customer base. In the beginning, you can respond to every support query yourself. When you scale, more of your support will shift towards more asynchronous and self-help solutions. It’s important to take your customers with you on that journey. The early adopter that you talked to every few days through your real-time chat will have to understand that your attention is more divided. Their expectations will need to change with your structural changes.</p>



<p><strong>Find the At-Risk-of-Leaving Customers</strong></p>



<p>In the best case, a customer stays with you for many years. They love your product, their very wishes come true every time, and they become catalysts for your marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is, of course, utopian. Every single customer of yours has different problems and hardships, and what works for one may not work for the other. Inevitably, at some point, a few customers will think about canceling. If you want your retention to remain high, there are two things you can do:</p>



<p><strong>Convince them to stay before leaving.</strong>&nbsp;The hard part is to figure out who is about to leave. You can track people clicking the button that starts the cancellation process and trigger a customer service conversation. Tag this customer as someone who should receive a follow-up email asking what you can do for them. You can track other things than clear cancellation intent: do they stop using the product for a long time? Stay clear of acting too quickly, as this is often a result of vacation, maternal leave, or just other priorities. But it is worth measuring so that you have an indicator you can use to inform your communication strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Convince them to come back after they leave.</strong>&nbsp;This is your last chance to retain them as a customer. After someone cancels, give them a grace period of a few days or hours, but re-engage them. Depending on how shameless you want to be, ask them to return with a free month, or even extend them the offer of a lifetime discount for returning on a paid subscription. As long as it fits into your economic calculations, keeping a customer is worth more than losing them, even with reduced revenue.</p>



<p>There is a difference in what makes customers leave, and it is connected to how long they have been with you. Early customers are more likely to quit because of lower switching costs and less dependency on your service within their established workflows. They’re more jittery, so expect their cohorts to cancel more. Long-term customers quit for different reasons: either their perceived value decreases or the problem-solution-fit of your service is misaligned. Take your customer size and age into account when you craft your messaging for each cohort, and find something that works for each of them.</p>



<p><strong>Actionable Retention</strong></p>



<p>Here are a few things we did at FeedbackPanda to keep customer retention as high as possible.</p>



<p>Staying in touch with your customers will keep them engaged. Offer a weekly newsletter to expose them to things that happened in their industry will do two things: first, it will associate your business with a trusted source of information, and it will also show that you know what you’re talking about. Building trust and reputation goes a long way toward retaining a customer.</p>



<p>Tighten and focus your onboarding. A customer who “gets it” quickly after signing up will stay with you longer and think of your business as a dependable service. If you can reduce the number of steps until your prospective customer reaches the “a-ha” effect, go for it. There is nothing better than a customer telling their peers that your service is “a no-brainer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do things that don’t scale. Send a postcard. Delight your customers with surprises on their birthdays. Send them a gift after they’ve been with you for a year. Host a meetup in the city where most of them live. Surprise them in ways that other businesses can’t — and wouldn’t. Not only will this make those customers stick around, but word will travel, and you will benefit from your customers sharing their delight and surprise with each other. When we had our first one hundred customers, we sent out postcards to all of them.

    <p>Graham Wallas was a social phycologist and founder of the London School of Economics, and he was the first one to propose a first complete model of a creative process. He described this model in 1926 in the book named “The Art of Thought”.</p>

<p>There he includes the three stages identified by Hermann von Helmholtz (a German physician and physicist) in 1891 - preparation, incubation, and Illumination - and adds a fourth one - Verification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the daily stream of thought, these four different stages constantly overlap as we explore different problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will try to describe below a little bit about the original process, and then at the end, you will find some hints of how to support better each phase taken from a Ph.D. thesis written by Arendse, Sedick and named “Evaluating and implementing a deliberate creativity framework to enhance retail business performance” - read it all here if you want: <a href="https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/12232?show=full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/12232?show=full</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start.</p>

<p><img src="https://ghinda.com/blog/assets/images/articles/wallace-creative-problem-solving.png" alt="Wallace Creative Problem Solving"></p>
<hr>
      <h3 id="preparation">
        
        
          Preparation <a href="#preparation">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Preparation focuses on learning and understanding to gather information and define the problem and its requirements.</p>

<p>Here are some key points from Wallace about this stage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The problem should “be investigated in all directions.”</li>
  <li>The process should be a <em>“hard, conscious, systematic, and fruitless analysis of the problem”</em>.</li>
  <li>Acquire as many facts as possible and try to memorize them so that later you will be able to form associations quickly. 
&amp; A possible way of handing this preparation is to follow up on multiple propositions.</li>
</ul>

<p>A great quote from Wallas regarding this stage is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our mind is not likely to give us a clear answer to any particular problem unless we set it a clear question, and we are more likely to notice the significance of any new piece of evidence or new association of ideas if we have formed a definite conception of a case to be proved or disproved</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some great additions from Arendse thesis regarding the implementation of Wallace model, especially when working with groups are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shared space for participants to put and access information</li>
  <li>Defining and clarifying group objectives</li>
  <li>Allowing a mix of public and non-public areas for participants to work.</li>
</ul>
    <hr>
      <h3 id="incubation">
        
        
          Incubation <a href="#incubation">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Incubation is where the participant will not focus on the problem, but do any other non-demanding tasks (like sleeping, walking, listening to music, etc.). In contrast, the subconscious will focus on solutions.</p>

<p>Critical points from Wallace about this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This stage should include a large amount of mental relaxation.</li>
  <li>The mental relaxation should include a certain amount of physical exercise (<em>“walking in the woods”</em>, <em>“a stroll over hill and dale”</em>)</li>
  <li>Should be aware that sometimes substituting mental relaxation or physical exercise with reading books could negatively affect the creative process. Some other times reading books - especially literature - could help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Key points from Arendse:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do something different by switching to various tasks or unwinding.</li>
  <li>Depending on their profile, some people might work individually and others in groups.</li>
  <li>Perceptual indicators help this process: people should remain in the space where there is around the information about the subject.</li>
</ul>
    <hr>
      <h3 id="illumination">
        
        
          Illumination <a href="#illumination">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Illumination is when the participant will become aware of one or many solutions to the problem. Wallace calls Intimation the moment that precedes and accompanies the flash of Illumination.</p>

<p>When talking about Intimation, one of the best descriptions was written by McMurry in the book <em>“How to Study”</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Many of the best thoughts, probably most of them, do not come, like a flash, fully into being but find their beginnings in dim feelings, faint intuitions that need to be encouraged and coaxed before they can be surely felt and defined.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Key points from Wallace:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try to take precautions so that you will not be interrupted when the train of associations starts.</li>
  <li>Do not try to conclude and putting it into works too early in your train of associations.</li>
  <li>Sometimes you can start the Illumination by rereading some work that you did in the preparation phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wallace quotes here Henry Hazlitt who wrote in a book named <em>“Thinking as a science”</em> this beautiful passage:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Thoughts of certain kinds are so elusive that to attempt to articulate them is to scare them away, as a fish is scared by the slightest ripple. When these thoughts are in embryo, even the infinitesimal attention required for talking cannot be spared.”</p>
</blockquote>
    <hr>
      <h3 id="verification">
        
        
          Verification <a href="#verification">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Verification (or Elaboration and Evaluation) is when the participant will evaluate if the solution is viable and satisfy the problem’s requirements. 
Wallace says that verification is not too different that Preparation and defined Verification as a process where <em>“the validity of the idea was tested, and the idea itself was reduced to exact form”</em>.</p>
    <hr>
      <h3 id="about-the-creativy-process">
        
        
          About the creativy process <a href="#about-the-creativy-process">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>I find this book inspirational and very forward-thinking, taking into consideration that Wallace wrote it in 1926.</p>

<p>Among some interesting ideas, I take from Art of Though it that the creative process has an important component that lives into the subconscious and cannot be easily controlled. Still, some things might help the mind to come to an Illumination.</p>

<p>Here is what he says about how we arrive at a new idea:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Both the successful trains of association, which might have led to the ‘flash’ of success, and the final and successful train are normally either unconscious or take place (with ‘risings’ and ‘fallings’ of consciousness as success seems to approach or retire), in that periphery or ‘fringe’ of consciousness which surrounds our ‘focal’ consciousness as the sun’s ‘corona’ surrounds the disk of full luminosity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another essential idea is that that a mental activity once carried on will also leave our organism more prone to repeat that activity in the future.</p>
    
      <h3 id="habits-or-actions-to-stimulate-mental-processes">
        
        
          Habits or actions to stimulate mental processes <a href="#habits-or-actions-to-stimulate-mental-processes">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Wallace also proposes some actions to stimulate going into mental activity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<em>“Associative thought to a time-stimulus”</em> - if you do a mental activity every day at the same hour after a while, you will be able to go directly to focus (you will be warmed up to do the action that you wanted)</li>
  <li>
<em>“Habit of responding to a particularly sensory stimulus”</em> - it might be that some environment (the place you are, what it is in the room, etc.) are better at stimulating a type of mental activity</li>
  <li>
<em>“Daily repeated muscular action stimulates the memory of the thought-train”</em> - it might work to start your process by rereading what you wrote before.</li>
  <li>
<em>“Stimulus of breaking habit”</em> - he also warns that we should not become “slaves of our habits,” and he even suggests that in case you have used one of the habits described above for five days to change it with another one in the six-day.</li>
  <li>Start by working on <em>“what could be put off and leave till later what could not be put off”</em>. This allows you to focus on <em>“some question which, without a special effort of volition, we should be inclined to put off, a problem with slightly uncomfortable associations, or an inchoate train of still vague and only partially conscious thought”</em>
</li>
  <li>
<em>“Habit of watching the unfocussed fringe of their consciousness for any significant mental events which may appear there”</em>, should be accompanied by the habit of writing them down as they are without forcing yourself to give them a specific form or to elaborate them.</li>
  <li>
<em>“Habit of oral lecturing and seminar-teaching”</em> - where Wallace suggests that the ideas grow to each other when you are focusing on presenting them to an audience. You should go ahead and present to an audience (without reading from a paper) and be sure to note any ideas that might come into your mind during the presentation or afterward.</li>
</ol>
    
      <h3 id="more-about-writing-down-thoughts-and-ideas">
        
        
          More about writing down thoughts and ideas <a href="#more-about-writing-down-thoughts-and-ideas">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>It seems essential for an excellent thinker to keep track of different thoughts and ideas. Wallace suggests in this book some ways to handle this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write down ideas as they come, at the moment they arrive and in the form they come. Do not delegate for later the writing because you might lose them or forget them. Do not try to shape them, for you might interrupt a train of associations and loose some important though at the end.</li>
  <li>Once per week, reread these notes and try to connect them with your current work.</li>
  <li>If there is no connection with current work, then file the idea into a separate folder that Wallace names <em>“Redistribute”</em>, where you will put all these thoughts that seem important but do not belong elsewhere.</li>
  <li>From time to time, go through this folder and analyze what it is there.</li>
</ul>
    
      <h3 id="resources">
        
        
          Resources <a href="#resources">#</a>

                    <p><a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> sucks. Now before you jump out of your seat, hear me out. Heroku makes deploying applications dead simple. If you or a startup asked for a platform recommendation, I would pick Heroku in a heartbeat. Then what’s the problem? Well, Heroku <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">pricing</a> sucks.</p><p>I love to tinker. I build apps to test product ideas weekly. But spending $7 per app to validate my ideas with Heroku is a huge turn off. Heroku has a free tier but your apps sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity depending on your remaining free dyno hours.</p><p>If an app took off then at minimum I will have a $100 monthly bill. Not to mention I would have to optimize for limited compute resources if I want to keep my bill low. There are other alternatives, but none of them have a comparable developer experience. Use their <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">price estimator</a> if you don’t believe me.</p><p>The price debate always raises a question. Is it possible to save money by hosting my own Heroku-like platform? I can’t say for sure but I want to find out. Put simply, let’s tinker and flex those creativity muscles.</p><p>Today we kickoff the first post in a Heroku-on-Kubernetes series. Over the next few weeks I’ll document my journey as I explore how to build a Heroku platform on Kubernetes. I’ll share with you progress updates, system design plans, code snippets, and costs. </p><p>When I’m done, I’ll combine all these resources into a streamlined video you can watch to build your platform in a few hours. Then we’ll answer the question: can we save money by self-hosting Heroku?</p><p>Standups are a powerful tool for software development sprints. Let’s use the same format to track the development of our Heroku platform. </p><p><strong>What did you do yesterday or last session?</strong> Over the weekend I spent two hours working on a prototype to prove Heroku on Kubernetes platform is possible. Happy to report the prototype works. I built a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE</a> cluster using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing">preemptible e2-standard-4</a> worker nodes to save on prototyping costs. I installed <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a> with <a href="https://istio.io/latest/">Istio</a> to configure a serverless container runtime. I deployed a sample application. I made a request to the application, and got a working response. Then, I tore down the infrastructure to save money until the next session. Last session cost me $0.31 on Google Cloud.</p><p><strong>What will you do next session?</strong> Next I plan to mockup the main user workflows. The workflows will mirror the Heroku developer experience. I’ll use <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> since it's an easy to use design tool.</p><p><strong>What’s blocking you? </strong>No blockers.</p><p><strong>What questions do you have?</strong> I recently learned you can deploy <a href="https://linkerd.io/2020/03/23/serverless-service-mesh-with-knative-and-linkerd/">Knative with Ambassador and Linkerd</a>. (Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/wm">William</a> for the <a href="https://twitter.com/wm/status/1277434336774504448?s=20">tip</a>!) I wonder if I should spend time testing this setup. I’m more familiar with these components which reduces the number of tools I would need to learn. However, the Ambassador integrations is in the alpha stage. I might run into undocumented issues. </p><p>I know what I will do, but what should I work on next?</p><p>Join the mailing list to stay updated with the series. Hope you’re excited about this project!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"> <article>   <p>Setting the name/SSID of your WiFi to an emoji is fairly simple for the Fios Home Router. Simply log into the router, and go the page for setting the SSID.</p> <p>Once you are there open the developer console using <code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code> or by right clicking and clicking the option labeled along the lines of <code>Inspect Element</code> or <code>Inspect</code>. After this simply paste the following code into the console.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>validSSID</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span><span>(){</span><span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This overrides the current validSSID function which is used to make sure that your SSID is made of the Fios required 1-32 alphanumerical ascii characters. This is not an actual technical requirements for SSIDs with the 2012 standard of 802.11 (Section 6.3.11.2.2) stating SSIDs simply have to be a max of 32 bytes. Once this script is ran you should be able to type anything less than 32 bytes. This tends to be at most 32 characters, but depending on the size of the Unicode characters used it can be much less. For instance the fire emoji, <code>🔥</code>, is actually 4 bytes because of how UTF-8 works. This means that only 8 fire emojis could be used.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most frustrating and common experiences in the workplace is getting work blocked near the finish line. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feature is developed over the course of 3 months. In the launch meeting a manager swoops in and declares it can’t be released for security reasons.</li>
  <li>You ask your manager for feedback on a proposal. They don’t respond. You ask again. They give a cursory glance and say “looks good”. A week later you say you’re ready to send it out. Suddenly they flood the document with feedback which ruins your timeline.</li>
  <li>An entire division works on a project for weeks. The minute they make it live the VP of the division storms in and yells “revert!”. The VP is displeased with the styling and insists it can’t be shipped that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s usually one of 3 main causes for this anti-pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Laziness/mis-calculation/ego. The stakeholder thinks it’s more efficient for them to engage with something closer to the finish line than early stage. This is often a gross mis-calculation. Projects are like cruise ships - you want to get to your destination with a lot of little steering along the way, not heroics after things have veered off course.</li>
  <li>Problem 2: Bad process. A critical stakeholder isn’t procedurally involved at the right time. If you find yourself blocking projects regularly, it’s your responsibility to fix this. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Create good process</a>.</li>
  <li>Problem 3: Micromanagement. The project/proposal didn’t actually need the manager’s feedback, they just can’t help having to put their stamp on everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are simple but hard to master:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 1: If you don’t think you need to be involved early, imagine the project goes live without your feedback at all. If you’re comfortable with that, you probably don’t need to be involved early (or at all). If you do need to give feedback, do it early and along the way.</li>
  <li>Answer 2: Make sure you have a process that involves necessary stakeholders at the right time.</li>
  <li>Answer 3: Don’t micromanage.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mess up and find yourself giving major feedback near the finish line of a project, find ways to say yes and make sure you’re empathizing with the frustration that’s resulting from the late stage changes.</p>



<p>Some people actually take pride in blocking projects. Stakeholders who repeatedly view themselves as “saving the day” when it comes to tanking momentum and releases. They see themselves as a fountain of unique knowledge that prevent disasters.</p>

<p>This is almost always a result of incentives that are grossly mis-aligned. Some organizations have stakeholders who show up late in the game, who are not responsible for other teams being productive, who have 0 incentive to facilitate work and all the incentive to block things.</p>

<p>Companies should incentivize these stakeholders not only for preventing problematic releases, but also for the amount of things teams can get done to their requirements.  This ties their success to both risk management and enablement.</p>

"We're going to start eroding the expectation of privacy we have in our household by allowing certain monitoring practices to happen."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>University of Ottawa fourth-year student Oliver Benning has started a petition asking the school to end its agreement with Respondus. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Supplied by Oliver Benning)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Benning, who said&nbsp;he's become a privacy advocate in recent years, started a petition calling on the university to immediately stop using Respondus&nbsp;products.</p>  <p>"I'm not saying the university shouldn't have any kind of academic integrity measures for student assessments," he said. "I just felt like it needs to be in the middle ground. This is just way too extreme."</p>  <h2>University conducting pilot&nbsp;</h2>  <p>In a June 25 memo to teaching staff in the University of Ottawa's faculty of social sciences, vice-dean of undergraduate studies Marc Molgat states that the university has recently acquired an online proctoring system through Respondus.</p>  <p>Despite that memo, in a written response, administrators wouldn't confirm to CBC that the university is using Respondus products, and would only confirm it's&nbsp;pilot testing some form of remote proctoring software.</p>  <p>"Rest assured that privacy and the protection of personal information will be of primary concern to us when assessing available tools. We will ensure to inform our community in due time," wrote Isabelle Mailloux Pulkinghorn, the university's media relations manager.</p>  <p>She added that students will be asked for their consent and professors will be free to choose if they use remote proctoring tools. If a student decides not to consent, their professor would then need to find an alternate way to evaluate them.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"At this point, there isn't much that we can add," said Mailloux Pulkinghorn.</p>  <p>However, the university's own technical support website for instructors and students contains several paragraphs explaining how Respondus Monitor records video and audio of a student during a test, then analyzes the student's actions, including eye movement.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Sarah Elaine Eaton, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary, says post-secondary institutions are locked in an 'arms race' to procure remote proctoring technology designed to prevent cheating.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Supplied by Clayton MacGillvray)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>In a statement to CBC Ottawa, Respondus CEO David Smetters wrote "the architecture for LockDown Browser and Respondus Monitor is designed with protection of student privacy as a basic requirement."</p>  <p>He compared students using&nbsp;webcams for an exam to taking part in&nbsp;a Zoom or Microsoft Teams session.</p>  <p>"It's up to the university to decide whether the benefit of using webcams for online learning outweighs the privacy concern raised by students."</p>  <h2>Equity also a concern</h2>  <p>Beyond the privacy concerns, experts in university cheating have also raised the issue of equity when it comes to requiring students to film themselves during exams.&nbsp;</p>  <p>University of Calgary assistant professor Sarah Elaine Eaton, whose area of research is academic integrity, says many universities have been scrambling to address a jump in cases of academic fraud since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Some of them have sort of gone to a great arms race to get an online proctoring tool that's available to them," said Eaton. "That presents a number of complexities for students, and that some students don't have the technology or they don't have access to a stable internet&nbsp;[connection]."</p>  <p>Eaton said she also worries remote proctoring software and other programs designed to catch cheaters are reducing the role teachers play in fighting academic fraud.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I caution against turning to technology as a solution to complex ethical problems," she said. "We've seen over and over again that instructors still need to be part of the conversation."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>This monthly newsletter is focused on keeping you up to date with the industry, keeping your skills sharp, without wasting your valuable time. I will be sharing the most important articles, podcasts and videos of the month.

<h3>History Of Search Engines 👾</h3>
<p>Nope...It isn't not just Yahoo, Bing and Google. <a href="https://carlhendy.com/history-of-search-engines/#top" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This in-depth article</a> talks about the deep history of search engines and I guarantee there will be at least one thing in there that you didn't know <em>(I learned plenty when reading this)</em>. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>JetBrains Developer Survey 🗳</h3>
<p>My second favourite developer survey just released their results to show you what the developer market is doing. Python and JavaScript are still the champs. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Check it out for more insights</a>.</p>
<h3>Denofy 🗺️</h3>
<p>It's no secret that I am a <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/deno-the-complete-guide-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">big fan of Deno</a> and its future potential. <a href="https://github.com/garronej/denoify" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is a great library</a> that takes Node modules and converts them to Deno so you can have all that community goodness in your Deno projects.</p>

<h3>MDN 💔 Angular</h3>
<p>Mozilla Developer Network which is the defacto place for all JavaScript documentation for the web has new sections on Frameworks and Libraries. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">They have tutorials now on React, Vue and Ember</a>... but nothing for Angular...hmm wonder why?</p>
<p>But, whatever. Angular doesn't need them. <a href="https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">They just announced Angular 10</a>!</p>
<h3>Not Another Performance Article 🛸</h3>
<p>Ugh... ANOTHER performance article. But before you just brush this one off, it's actually a pretty good article showing you the process of analyzing performance and improving it beyond just doing super specific niche things for a measly 1% performance gain. <a href="https://3perf.com/blog/notion/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Actually recommend you read this</a>.</p>
<h3>Grid God/Godess 🏗</h3>
<p>Next time you want to present data inside of a grid/sheet style display on your website, there is no need to use anything else but this easy to use library. I wish I knew about this earlier: <a href="https://gridjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grid.js</a></p>
<h3>Port Scanning Shenanigans  🔬</h3>
<p>Although <a href="https://blog.nem.ec/2020/05/24/ebay-port-scanning/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this is a security article</a>, it actually teaches you a useful skill of how to analyze obfuscated JavaScript on any website. Trust me, you will learn something new and interesting by reading this article.</p>
<p>PS. Here is a fun review of how to <a href="https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/how-to-encrypt-your-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">encrypt your internet traffic</a> to stay safe out there. </p>
<h3>Relational VS Mongo 🌿</h3>
<p>The age old debate around Relational vs non Relational databases. HSBC just moved a bunch of their relational databases to MongoDB and Hackernews had a field day bashing them about it. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23507197" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A fun/educational read through the comments</a>. </p>
<p>If you want to geek out on latest Database advances, check out <a href="https://lucperkins.dev/blog/new-db-tech-1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for some of the exciting things happening in the space.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Project Ideas 🏟</h3>
<p>We recently released a new course in our online coding academy: <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20 JavaScript projects to add to your portfolio</a> and sharpen your JS knowledge. </p>
<p>You should check it out. But if you don't want to, here is a <a href="https://music-grid.surge.sh/#0-0-0-16-0-0-0-0-64-0-40-0-256-128-512-1024-&amp;200" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fun weekend project idea for you to build on your own</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I love this library: <a href="http://tholman.com/elevator.js/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elevator.js</a>
...and this one: <a href="https://riccardoscalco.it/textures/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Textures.js</a></p>
<h3>Bootstrap 5 is here 🌪</h3>
<p>Bootstrap is still around and hanging on strong. Although it may not be "new and sexy" it is a library that is designed very well that makes you productive. They just came out with <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">version 5</a>! I will be updating my <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Web Development course</a> once it is out of alpha stages this year with this newer version. </p>
<h3>What Is DevOps? 🥁</h3>
<p>We keep hearing this term, but would you be able to explain it in just a few sentences? The short answer is that DevOps is more of an ideology than an actual role. However, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/10/the-rise-of-the-devops-mindset/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this article</a> will break down its rise and what it all means much better than I can.</p>
<h3>How To Make Money on Github 🏦</h3>
<p>An interesting business model if you want to make money on Github and open source projects. Open source profitability is tough, but <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this person</a> seems to have found a way to do this successfully using the Github Sponsors model. Expect more of these stories to come out.</p>
<h3>Quick Web Accessibility 🔮</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.segunolalive.com/posts/how-web-accessibility-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A nice short overview</a> of how Web accessibility works and some of the things you should be doing for best practices.</p>
<h3>Let's Talk TypeScript 🗝</h3>
<p>There is no question that TypeScript is a big part of the Web Development world now. In this article, we get to learn some of its history and where it is going. TypeScript really took off when Angular announced they would be using it for their project back in the day, and it hasn't stopped since. <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/15/talking-typescript-with-ryan-cavanaugh/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Enjoy some insights from this interview</a>.</p>
<h3>Github Is Taking Over 🗿</h3>
<p>Github's latest Actions <em>(ha! get it?)</em> have really shown the powerhouse that it is. Now, they announced <a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-18-introducing-github-super-linter-one-linter-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github Linter</a>. A Github super linter that will lint all your code with no need for you to build your own linting pipeline. Things are becoming better and better with Github and I don't see why we shouldn't be using all their tools in one place.</p>
<h3>Container History 🧱</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/container-technologies-at-coinbase-d4ae118dcb6c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This was a really interesting article from Coinbase</a>. They discuss the history of containers, where we came from, and the current landscape (i.e. Kubernetes). Even if you aren't working with these technologies directly, it's a great overview of the container landscape and some of the reasons you may need/not need Kubernetes.</p>
<h3>Refactor vs Rewrite 👹 👺</h3>
<p>Software is never perfect. With time, all code needs to be re-factored or re-written. But which options should you chose? <a href="https://remesh.blog/refactor-vs-rewrite-7b260e80277a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This article</a> does a great job talking about the tradeoffs and when the rare occasions are when you want to do a full rewrite.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>6th issue! If you missed them, you can <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?tag=MLM">read the previous issues of the Machine Learning Monthly newsletter here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>🤖<strong>Welcome to Machine Learning Monthly</strong>... one of the best ways to get started in the industry. The first part of this series is about solving problems in machine learning. The second part is about how to use machine learning to solve problems in machine learning. In this post, I'll introduce you to a number of new machine learning algorithms that I've been working on for the last year or so. I'll also cover some of the more common problems and techniques that you'll find as you learn about machine learning. I will also be discussing the various problems that you'll encounter in machine learning, and the ways that you can learn them in this series.</p>
<hr>
<p>Woah... The above paragraph was completely artificially generated. I fed a machine learning algorithm known as <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GPT-2</a> (check out #2 below) the words "welcome to machine learning monthly" and it completed the rest. </p>
<p>Anyway, back to people generated words (I promise).</p>
<p>Hey everyone, Daniel here, I'm 50% of the instructors behind the <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery</a> course. </p>
<p>This is the sixth edition of Machine Learning Monthly. A 500ish word post detailing some of the most interesting things on machine learning I've found (or made) in the last month. </p>
<p>Let’s get into it.</p>

<h3>What you missed in June as a Machine Learning Engineer…</h3>
<hr>
<h2>My posts</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-can-a-beginner-data-scientist-like-me-gain-experience/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“How can a beginner data scientist like me gain experience?”</a> — Manuela emailed me this question and I replied with a few things I think you’ll find useful. The main one being: start the job before you have it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-i-got-tensorflow-developer-certified/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">How I passed the TensorFlow developer certification (and how you can too)</a> — During May I set myself up with a curriculum to sharpen some of my TensorFlow skills. All with the goal of taking the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TensorFlow developer certification</a> at the start of June. I took the exam and passed. So I put together an article (and video) of resources and techniques that I used to do it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. <a href="https://dbourke.link/mlmap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning Roadmap 2020</a></h2>
<p>When starting out machine learning, it can be hard to connect the dots. From the different machine learning tools, to the process of working on a machine learning project, to the different kinds of evaluation metrics you need for each problem.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dbourke.link/mlmap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning Roadmap 2020</a> (actually a big interactive mind map) connects many of the most important concepts, as well as resources for learning more about each of them.</p>
<p>More specifically, it covers (broadly):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Machine learning problems</strong> — how to diagnose a machine learning problem.</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning process</strong> — once you’ve identified a machine learning problem, what steps can you take to solve it?</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning tools</strong> — what tools are available to you to solve the problem?</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning mathematics</strong> — since machine learning is largely using math to find patterns in numbers, what subfields of math are running under the hood of the machine learning algorithm you‘re calling?</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning resources</strong> — alright, so the above has sparked your curiosity, how do you learn these things? This part has you covered.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m so excited for this. I think you’ll love it.</p>

<p>PS. Stay tuned for a full 2.5 hour video version coming soon which will premiere on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt7T2EvYBqvlxNU3fbE4Y7g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zero To Mastery Youtube Channel</a>. Subscribe now so that you don't miss it!</p>
<h2>2. <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aitextgen</a> — Leverage OpenAI's GPT-2 architecture to generate text</h2>
<p>I spent an hour or so playing around with this. You can get up and running in under 5-minutes on Google Colab (just follow the instructions in the GitHub repo). </p>
<p>Max Woolf makes some really cool things and this might be my favourite yet.</p>
<p>Out of the box, <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aitextgen</a> leverages OpenAI's 124M parameter version of GPT-2 (for context, the biggest one available is 1.5B parameters) to take in a seed, such as, "welcome to machine learning monthly" and then it artificially generates text up to your desired length (using the max_length parameter).</p>
<p>You can even train the model on your own text to generate something flavoured with your style (perhaps it could read all of your old blog posts and generate a new one for you?).</p>
<p>As text generation gets better and better, it'll be an interesting time when you could effectively run a social media account with purely AI-generated text.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Using AI to play like Bach</a></h2>
<p>As if generating text with AI wasn't enough to fuel your artistic dreams. How about using AI to generate music in the style of Bach (a famous German composer)?</p>
<p>Last year, Google did just that with their <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Doodle</a>. They trained a machine learning model (called Coconet) on 306 of Bach's compositions and created an interactive demo where you can enter your own music notes and have them artificially harmonized (turned into something that sounds pretty good).</p>
<p>I'm liking this theme. </p>
<p>AI generated art is definitely becoming a thing. If you never fancied yourself a musician but you can code, now you can write code to play the music for you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post that went along with</a> it is also truly worth the read.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="https://dfrieds.com/articles/data-science-reality-vs-expectations.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Data science: expectations vs. reality</a></h2>
<p>Dan Friedman attended a 12-week data science bootcamp in 2016, during which ML &amp; AI was everywhere in the news. However, after some experience in the field, he found his expectations didn't meet reality.</p>
<p>In particular, some takeaways include:</p>
<ul>
<li>People don't know what "data science" does (it's more than just running machine learning algorithms)</li>
<li>Most ML projects don't make it into production</li>
<li>Data &amp; data infrastructure tools are lacking (data in industry is different to data you find in books &amp; Kaggle competitions)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two are very real. Building a model these days is becoming very approachable, however, getting it into people's hands is the real challenge.</p>
<p>Enter, MLOps.</p>
<h2>5. <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">What the hell is MLOps anyway?</a></h2>
<p>So you want to get your machine learning model out into the world?</p>
<p>Well then, you'll probably want to familiarize yourself with MLOps (short for machine learning operations). If you're familiar with DevOps, MLOps is the same but with machine learning thrown in the mix.</p>
<p>In essence, MLOps is all the things you need around your machine learning model so users can interact with it.</p>
<p>It's a combination of: a data pipeline (a way to collect and prepare data), a machine learning model (the fun part) and a way to serve that machine learning model (a web or mobile application or API).</p>
<p>A few years ago, deploying a machine learning model was like black magic. Some (outside of large tech companies) had heard of it and even less had done it.</p>
<p>Now though, the tools in the space of getting your machine learning creation to the world are growing and the good thing is, <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chip Huyen has written a fantastic blog post</a> reflecting on what she learned by going through 200+ (yes, two-hundred plus) of them.</p>
<p>Check it out and use what you learn to get your machine learning models in the hands of people around the world.</p>
<h2>6. <a href="https://hanlab.mit.edu/projects/ofa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">One neural network to rule them all!</a></h2>
<p>(not really, just a really cool way to train a single neural network and have it be optimised for multiple device types).</p>
<p>This is actually a really important piece of research.</p>
<p>Usually, to have the same machine learning model deployed across multiple device types (think smartphone, desktop PC and microcontroller), you'd need to train a separate model for each one.</p>
<p>This practice of training a separate machine learning model for each device type, especially when they're all learning similar things, turns out to be incredibly wasteful (perhaps surprisingly, computing power doesn't magically grow on trees, it burns carbon and releases emission).</p>
<p>Not anymore. The <a href="https://ofa.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">once for all network (codenamed OFA)</a> is a training paradigm which allows you to train a neural network once and have it automatically adapt itself (during training) for different devices.</p>
<p>The explanation the researchers give is worth reading itself, let alone the outstanding work they've created.</p>
<h2>7.  <a href="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All of the matrix calculus you need for deep learning</a></h2>
<p>Jeremy Howard (the creator of fast.ai) decided he needed to know more about the matrix calculus which works under the hood of deep learning.</p>
<p>So he and his colleague Terence Parr wrote a book about it.</p>
<p>That's the trick. If you want to know something about something, write a book about it.</p>
<p>And if you want to brush up your matrix calculus (and your deep learning from scratch skills), <a href="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning book</a> is for you.</p>
<h2>8. <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-minerl-challenge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Can AI play Minecraft?</a></h2>
<p>A new challenge has kicked off on AI Crowd. The goal? Teach an AI system to find a diamond in Minecraft.</p>
<p>Now, you see, I've never played Minecraft and never intend to. But this kind of challenge excites me.</p>
<p>If you want to get hands-on with a reinforcement learning project (if you do well, you'll probably be ripe for a job at OpenAI or DeepMind), check out the <a href="https://minerl.io/competition/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2020 MineRL challenge</a>.</p>
<h2>9. <a href="https://medium.com/@alexeyab84/yolov4-the-most-accurate-real-time-neural-network-on-ms-coco-dataset-73adfd3602fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YOLOV4</a> — The state of the art real-time object detection model, You Only Look Once, is back (for a 4th time)</h2>
<p>If you ever want to announce that you're launching a state of the art machine learning algorithm, <a href="https://medium.com/@alexeyab84/yolov4-the-most-accurate-real-time-neural-network-on-ms-coco-dataset-73adfd3602fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aleksey Bochkovskiy's Medium article</a> should be your reference point.</p>
<p>The first paragraph says enough.</p>
<p>"Darket YOLOv4 is faster and more accurate than real-time neural networks Google TensorFlow EfficientDet and FaceBook Pytorch/Detectron RetinaNet/MaskRCNN on Microsoft COCO dataset."</p>
<p>This just goes to show, determined, small-group researchers can take on the likes of Google and Facebook.</p>
<h2>10. <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">End-to-end object detection with Transformers</a></h2>
<p>Speaking of object detection, Facebook just did it with a new style (well, a different model than what's usually used).</p>
<p>Transformers (a machine learning architecture) have been breaking all kinds of records in the NLP (natural language processing) space over the past year. Now they're making their way into computer vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DETR (short for detection transformer) is a transformer-based object …</a></p></div></div>

<p>The de­sign is rather un­con­ven­tion­al in or­der to avoid the well-known
short­com­ings of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector">std::vec­tor</a>, es­pe­cial­ly when it comes to cus­tom
al­lo­ca­tors. The im­ple­men­ta­tion present in 2020.06 is still miss­ing ar­bi­trary
in­ser­tion and dele­tion which is why it’s not ad­ver­tised in more de­tail yet —
once that’s done, ex­pect a ded­i­cat­ed ar­ti­cle to­geth­er with bench­marks and
com­par­i­son to com­mon im­ple­men­ta­tions. Un­til then, see
<a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/corrade/classCorrade_1_1Containers_1_1Array.html#Containers-Array-growable">Grow­able ar­rays</a> for an in­tro­duc­tion.</p>
<p>One of the last re­main­ing pieces of STL that are <span>hold­ing us back</span> not as
light­weight &amp; flex­i­ble as I’d want them to be are <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string">std::string</a>s. Af­ter
the re­lease cut I de­cid­ed that new APIs are not go­ing to use those any­more,
which means a re­place­ment is un­der­way. Ex­ist­ing APIs will get grad­u­al­ly port­ed
away, sim­i­lar­ly as was done with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector">std::vec­tor</a> or <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">std::unique_p­tr</a>
in the past. Of course, as al­ways, an <em>opt-in</em> com­pat­i­bil­i­ty of the new APIs
with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string">std::string</a> / <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view">std::string_view</a> will be pro­vid­ed — the goal
is not to alien­ate users of stan­dard C++, the goal is to be flex­i­ble and
pro­vide al­ter­na­tives.</p>

<h2><a href="#what-s-new-in-plugins">What’s new in plug­ins</a></h2>
<p>The more Mag­num gets used to im­port a in­creas­ing­ly broad range of datasets in
var­i­ous for­mats, the more pre­vi­ous­ly un­han­dled cor­ner cas­es get dis­cov­ered and
fixed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1Trade_1_1AssimpImporter.html">As­simpIm­porter</a> now cor­rect­ly im­ports
mul­ti-prim­i­tive mesh­es, pre­serves al­pha in ma­te­ri­als and ac­counts for Y up
/ Z up ori­en­ta­tion over­ride, if a file de­fines it.</li>
<li>All im­porters now im­port both base col­or and tex­ture in­stead of ei­ther one
or the oth­er. In­ter­est­ing­ly, this was a lim­i­ta­tion that orig­i­nat­ed from the
COL­LA­DA for­mat — the ear­ly <a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/namespaceMagnum_1_1Trade.html">Trade</a> APIs and the now-gone
<code>ColladaImporter</code> plug­in were mod­elled af­ter it, how­ev­er when re­view­ing
this de­sign de­ci­sion it turned out that COL­LA­DA is ac­tu­al­ly the on­ly for­mat
with such re­stric­tion and ev­ery oth­er for­mat (OBJ, glTF, OpenGEX, …)
sup­ports com­bin­ing both.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1Trade_1_1TinyGltfImporter.html">TinyGlt­fIm­porter</a> failed to im­port
in­ter­leaved mesh­es. This was a short­cut done to make the ear­ly
im­ple­men­ta­tion sim­pler. To my sur­prise, ap­par­ent­ly the vast ma­jor­i­ty of
glTF mod­els is ex­port­ed de-in­ter­leaved and thus in­ef­fi­cient for the GPU,
which ex­plains why this lim­i­ta­tion went large­ly un­no­ticed since the
orig­i­nal plug­in re­lease in 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>Im­age im­porters weren’t left be­hind ei­ther — for­mats that sup­port it such as
DDS or Ba­sis Uni­ver­sal now can im­port par­tic­u­lar mip lev­els us­ing
<a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1Trade_1_1AbstractImporter.html#a9624991f2d46d5da6ec17e1c84d620aa">Trade::Ab­strac­tIm­porter::im­age2DLev­el­Count()</a> and the sec­ond pa­ram­e­ter of

you about longer-run­ning op­er­a­tions or pro­cess­ing stats. It’s prob­a­bly most
help­ful in case of As­simp, which likes to crash or mis­be­have on cer­tain files.</p>

    <h2>Code Mode</h2>

<p>It's been a wild week. You and your team have been engaged in an all-out war with the codebase for the past two spints. There's this new integration with a partner that's close to being shipped, and it promises bountiful revenue and voluminous web traffic. And you've been working on the part of it that'll seal the deal and let your squad deploy, come Monday morning.</p>

<p>You find yourself on the Friday night before launch, 6pm, absolutely fried at your desk. Everyone else on your team already left to attend the company happy hour, or has gone home seeking sanity from work. For the past several hours, you've been tracking down a nasty, horrendous bug that could prevent the feature from shipping next week.</p>

<p>But you introduced it.</p>

<p>Caught late in the game, with the marketing team eager to deploy, there were no other options. Thankfully, you're close to patching things up. Your thoughts have been a web of abstractions all night, looking something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've looked at <code>SuperClass</code>, but the stack trace is from <code>ChildClass</code>.</li>
<li>Alright, so <code>ChildClass</code> imports the function from <code>HelperModule</code>...</li>
<li><code>HelperModule</code> uses a bunch of functions from <code>CrazyLibrary</code>. Let's do a search. Great, <code>CrazyLibrary</code> has no documentation.</li>
<li>Wait, did I check out the latest <code>master</code> yet?</li>
<li>Oh wait, the error wasn't actually on the server. Let's look at the client.</li>
<li><code>HugeReactComponent</code> is making the call. Maybe the <code>type</code> is wrong?</li>
<li>Oh man, it uses <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>... I don't know <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>.</li>
<li>Wait no, it's in <code>MiddlewareClientServer</code>...</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/0*UxR4_Op7AExQz-Oo.png"></p>

<p>At 7:30pm, you're sure you've nailed it. It was a silly conditional that got in the way. Boom, problem solved. After merging a PR that switched the broken ternary statement around, off to the happy hour you go.</p>

<p>Beaming with pride from merging the bug fix, you walk in, and notice your team chatting with folks from a sister team. You recognize some members of the sister team, but not everyone. You go and try to introduce yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hey y'all, what's happening?!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both your team and the sister team sheepishly smile at you. "Hey man", one of them says, "long day?" You look around, and suddenly notice that some people have startled looks on their faces. Then you realize they had been having a low-key conversation, and that you'd jumped into the conversation at quite the high decibel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yeah, haha", you play it off, "Oh boy, working on the <code>PartnerIntegrationProject</code> this week was awful! Whoever wrote <code>SuperClass</code> created a complete mess. Must've taken 10 hours away from my life."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone in the circle stops smiling. Eric, who wrote that class, nervously chuckles. "Yeah, I guess it could be better, huh?" Oops. Bad move. You feel the energy drain out of the conversation they were having.</p>

<p>You stay silent for the next half hour or so, and everyone keeps chatting, but it <em>feels</em> weird. You keep noticing people's expressions and body language. There's some more forced conversation before a few folks excuse themselves. Then everyone disperses.</p>

<p>And for the rest of the evening, you can't shake off the feeling that everyone's thinking something about you. That you did something wrong. You get a sense that the energy was off, and blame yourself.</p>

<p>But you're not to blame! Everything was probably fine, and no one was judging you. You were just in <strong>code mode</strong>.</p>

<h2>What Happens In Your Brain When You Program?</h2>

<p>Ask any developer, and "code mode" is a real thing. We seem to be so drawn into our innermost thoughts of <code>classes</code>, <code>modules</code>, <code>syntax</code>, and <code>systems</code>-- that we lose track of how to mentally function the rest of the time. Some call it "monkey mind" or restlessness, but we all recognize it. It's the brain on hyperdrive, going 200 miles per hour when the speed limit's about 50.</p>

<p>It's the thinking, or rather, <em>the overthinking</em>, that is almost always unnecessary. And for reasons unbeknownst, this always tends to happen when we need to deal with other people.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/95NZpPy.png"></p>

<p>Now, that doesn't seem problematic, right? Being stuck in code mode is harmless. So you overthink the occasional small talk session, and can't really pay attention to long films, but is it really harmful?</p>

<p>No, not really. But understanding why it happens helps us understand how to make the gear switch a little bit smoother, which is behind my upcoming pitch for meditation. If you're able to leave the programmatic thought patterns behind anytime you'd like, you have greater control over your life.</p>

<p>Of course, we want to be sure of our assumptions. After all, the argument for meditation requires a somewhat well-formed paradigm of what's happening when we read and write code. It's important to take into account exactly which thought patterns we "execute" <strong>while</strong> in code mode.</p>

<h2>What's Going On Up There?</h2>

<p>There was a push in recent years to allow programming to replace the study of a foreign language. Around that time, <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10085745%20conducted%20a%20study%20that%20observed%2017%20participants%20in%20an%20fMRI%20scanner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Norman Peitek, Janet Siegmund, and a team of researchers</a> while they were comprehending short source-code snippets. Their key finding was that despite the stereotype of math and logic being the major concern in programming, the brains of the participants showed greater activation of its language centers than expected.</p>

<p>Now, this may be confusing to you, as it seemingly contradicts <em>the idea of code mode</em>. After all, if the language centers are activated, shouldn't we, as social beings who communicate through the use of language, not be affected by these lingering cognitive thought patterns?</p>

<p>This could be so. But if we dig deeper into the results of the sudy, we actually find that the programmer mind is activated more traditionally than the above finding would suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In essence, we found five relevant activation clusters, all in the left hemisphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The function of the left hemisphere is thought to be for control of the right side of the body, and "is the more academic and logical side of the brain". The right hemisphere is associated with creativity, visual/spatial perception, and emotional management and expression.</p>

<p>Because this <a href="https://now.northropgrumman.com/the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-is-it-true/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been disputed recently</a>, I took a look at what naysayers of the "left-brain, right-brain myth" were saying. It turns out, most of the rejection of this "myth" stems from the fact that <em>people are not usually left-brain or right-brain dominant</em>. However, the fact of the matter is, the left hemisphere is <strong>still associated</strong> with logical operations and analytical functions, and the right with more "emotional" or "creative" activities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, a 2013 University of Utah study on brain lateralization examined the brains of more than 1,000 people and found no evidence for people having a dominant side of the brain. <em>Even though each side of the brain does more work for certain functions</em>, such as language being localized on the left and attention on the right, this doesn’t vary by person. All of the study participants, whether they were engineers or musicians, used their entire brain equally, debunking the left-brain right-brain myth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to programming being left hemisphere dominant, there's also a lot going on. The earlier study referenced found that the activated regions while coding found were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Middle frontal gyrus (division of attention, silent word reading, verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Middle temporal gyrus (categorization)</li>
<li>Inferior parietal lobule (verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (verbal/numeric)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (silent word reading, problem solving)</li>
</ol>

<p>If this sounds like a surprisingly high amount of brain activity merely for <em>understanding source code</em>, I would agree. And if it sounds like you'd be surprised if all this happened when trying to sleep or talking to a friend, you'd probably be right. Thus, I'd argue that one should choose to believe that quite a bit is going in mentally when we program, and mostly in the left hemisphere.</p>

<h2>But Isn't It Fun?</h2>

<p>An interesting note to add is that this kind of intensive brain activity sounds painful in a challenging way, but is actually desirable. Many call it the "flow" state. Courtland Allen and Vincent Woo <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/041-vincent-woo-of-coderpad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talked about it in their interview on IndieHackers</a>:</p>

<p>Courtland says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's funny because it reminds me of the first two years after I moved to San Francisco. I started a startup and I basically just coded for sixteen hours a day, every day for two years, and the problem is that if you're in flow for that long and you don't vary your activities... you don't make new memories, everything just blurs together, so I have a two year block of time in my life where there were zero memories, and I swore that I would never do that again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which Vincent replies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's kind of what I suspected happened to that sixty year old plus guy at Amazon, I think he just sat down to code one day and then he woke up, and he was sixty. I don't know, I think flow is both really seductive and also kind of boring in it's own way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fascinating take-away of the above conversation is the conflation of two different ideas: <code>flow</code> state and <code>code mode</code>. From our good friend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I argue this point, and I want to be succint: <code>flow</code> and <code>code mode</code> appear to be two sides of the same coin. That specific coin is neurotransmitter-fueled activity, causing us to hone in one problem (or consecutive problems) for an indefinite period of time. However, we generally use the term <code>flow</code> to refer to the good parts of it, and I'm using <code>code mode</code> as the detrimental aspect.</p>

<p>I think we'd all agree that <a href="https://algodaily.com/lessons/solving-the-health-problems-of-software-engineers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">16 hours spent on something is not good for your health</a>, mentally or physically. Especially <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321751043/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=algodaily03-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321751043&amp;linkId=6fb078bf069b7f8eb648902d5923ab87" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the art of programming</a>-- your back aches, your eyes burn, and you leave the coding session feeling unsatisfied. This is what we want to avoid, and the mental fatigue this imparts on you will carry over to other parts of life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Have you ever wondered how effective Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams manage complex applications successfully? In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there is only one answer: Kubernetes Operators! In this article, we will examine both what they are and how they work.</p><div><p>The Kubernetes Operator concept was developed by engineers at CoreOS in 2016 as an advanced and native way of building and driving every application on the Kubernetes cluster, which needs domain-specific knowledge. It provides a consistent approach to handle all application operational processes automatically, without any human reaction via close cooperation with the Kubernetes API. In other words, an operator is a way of packaging, running, and managing Kubernetes applications.</p><p>The Kubernetes Operator pattern acts in accordance with one of the core Kubernetes principles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">the control theory</a>. In robotics and automation, it is a mechanism that continuously operates dynamical systems. It relies on an ability to quickly tailor the workload demand to the available resources as accurately as possible. The objective is to develop a control model with the necessary logic to help an application or system remain stable. In Kubernetes world, that part is handled by controllers.</p><p>A controller is a special software that, in the loop, responds to changes and performs adaptation actions in the cluster. The first Kubernetes controller was a kube-controller-manager. It is regarded as an ancestor for all operators, which were built later.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-controller-loop">What Is a Controller Loop?</h2><p>To put it simply, controller loops are the base of controller actions. Imagine there is a non-terminating process (called a reconciliation loop, in Kubernetes) happening over and over again, as in the following illustration:</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4d00a0df53a752d79d89dbdf5f9da2b36f5167b3/b8cdc/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>This process observes at least one Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#kubernetes-objects">object</a>, which contains information about the desired state. Objects such as …</p><ul><li>Deployments,</li><li>Services,</li><li>Secrets,</li><li>Ingress,</li><li>Config Maps,</li></ul><p>… are defined by configuration files made up of manifests in JSON or YAML. Then the controller(s) makes a continuous adjustment via Kubernetes API to imitate the desired state until the current state becomes the desired state, according to the built-in logic.</p><p>In that way, Kubernetes deals with the dynamic nature of Cloud Native systems, by handling a constant change. Examples of modifications perform to achieve expected state include:</p><ul><li>Noticing when nodes go down and demanding a new one.</li><li>Checking if pods need to be replicated.</li><li>Creating a new load-balancer, if requested.</li></ul><h2 id="how-does-a-kubernetes-operator-work">How Does a Kubernetes Operator Work?</h2><p>An operator is an application-specific controller. It extends a Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage complex applications on behalf of humans (operation engineers or site reliability engineers). Let’s see what Kubernetes documentation says about it.</p><blockquote><p><em>Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Operators follow Kubernetes principles, notably the control loop.</em> - <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">Kubernetes Documentation</a></p></blockquote><p>So far, you know that operators take advantage of controllers that observe Kubernetes objects. These controllers are a bit different because they are tracing custom objects, often called custom resources (CR). CR is an extension of the Kubernetes API that provides a place where you can store and retrieve structured data—the desired state of your application. The whole principle of operation is presented in the diagram below.</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/63c39aec0db28d70ff470c5aec042c5301b8bc3e/93486/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>The Operator continuously tracks cluster events relating to a specific type of custom resource. The types of events on these custom resources that can be tracked are:</p><ul><li>Add,</li><li>Update,</li><li>Delete.</li></ul><p>When the operator receives any information, it will take action to adjust the Kubernetes cluster or external system to the desired state as part of its reconciliation loop in the custom controller.</p><h2 id="how-to-add-a-custom-resource">How to add a custom resource?</h2><p>A custom resource extends Kubernetes capabilities by adding new kinds of objects that can be helpful for your application. Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to clusters:</p><ul><li><strong>via API Aggregation</strong>, an advanced method that requires you to build your own API Server, but will give you more control</li><li><strong>via Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)</strong>, a simple way that can be created without any programming knowledge, as an extension to the original Kubernetes API server.</li></ul><p>These two options meet the needs of different users, who can choose between flexibility and ease of use. The Kubernetes community created a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#choosing-a-method-for-adding-custom-resources">comparison</a> that will help you decide what method is right for you, but the most popular choice is CRD.</p><h3 id="custom-resource-definitions">Custom Resource Definitions</h3><p>Custom Resource Definitions have been around for quite some time now; the first major API specification was released with Kubernetes 1.16.0. The manifest below presents an example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
<span>kind</span>: CustomResourceDefinition
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application.stable.example.com
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>group</span>: stable.example.com
  <span>version</span>: v1
  <span>scope</span>: Namespaced
  <span>names</span>:
    <span>plural</span>: application
    <span>singular</span>: applications
    <span>kind</span>: Application
    <span>shortNames</span>:
      - app
</code></pre></div><p>This CRD will allow you to create a CR called <em>Application</em>. (We are going to use it in the next section.) The first two lines define what <code>apiVersion apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> of object kind <code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> you want to create.</p><p>The metadata describes the name of the resource, but the most important place here is the field <em>spec</em>. It lets you specify the group and version and the scope of visibility - namespaced or cluster-wide.</p><p>Afterwards, you define names in multiple formats and create a handy short name, which lets you perform a command <code>kubectl get app</code> to get the existing CR.</p><h3 id="custom-resource">Custom Resource</h3><p>The CRD above allows you to create the following manifest of a custom resource.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: stable.example.com/v1
<span>kind</span>: Application
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application-config
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>image</span>: container-registry-image:v1<span>.0.0</span>
  <span>domain</span>: teamx.yoursaas.io
  <span>plan</span>: premium
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, we can contain here all the necessary information required to run an application for a specific case. This custom resource will be observed by our operator - to be precise, by the operator’s custom controller. According to the built-in logic in the controller, the necessary actions will imitate the desired state. It can create a Deployment, Service, and necessary ConfigMaps for our application. Run it and expose it via ingress on a specific domain. This is just an example of a use case, but it can do whatever is designed.</p><p>Operators can also be used to provision resources that live outside Kubernetes. You can control the provisioning of external routers or create a database in the cloud without leaving the Kubernetes platform.</p><h2 id="kubernetes-operators-a-case-study">Kubernetes Operators: a Case Study</h2><p>To have a whole clear picture of Kubernetes Operators, let’s examine a <a href="https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator">Prometheus Operator</a>, one of the first and most popular operators. It simplifies the deployment and configuration of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related monitoring components.</p><p>The core feature of the Prometheus Operator is to monitor the Kubernetes API server for changes to specific objects and ensure that the current Prometheus deployments match these objects. The Operator acts on the following Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):</p><ul><li><strong>Prometheus</strong>, which defines a desired Prometheus deployment.</li><li><strong>Alertmanager</strong>, which defines a desired Alertmanager deployment.</li><li><strong>ServiceMonitor</strong>, which declaratively specifies how groups of Kubernetes services should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.</li><li><strong>PodMonitor</strong>, which declaratively specifies how a group of pods should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.</li><li><strong>PrometheusRule</strong>, which defines a desired set of Prometheus alerting and/or recording rules. The Operator generates a rule file, which can be used by Prometheus instances.</li></ul><p>The Prometheus Operator automatically detects changes in the Kubernetes API server to any of the above objects, and ensures that matching deployments and configurations are kept in sync.</p><h2 id="need-more">Need more?</h2><p>If you would like to hear more about how to extend Kubernetes, take a look at this talk from one of my Container Solutions colleagues, Adam Otto, from <a href="https://cloudnativewarsaw.com/">Cloud Native Warsaw Conference</a>.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QoCL1NCVv4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><hr><p>The article has been originally published on the <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/kubernetes-operators-explained">Container Solutions</a> blog.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is another blog post related to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/build-systems-la-carte/">Build Systems à la Carte</a> paper. See <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2020/type-classes-build-systems/">Using type-classes to model the expressivity of build systems</a> for the first one.</p>

<p>The paper proposes splitting build systems into two components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Rebuilders</strong> decide when to rebuild a particular key (file).</li>
<li><strong>Schedulers</strong> decide <em>how</em> to rebuild multiple keys - handling dependencies while maintaining correctness and efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<p>Schedulers come in 3 flavors (see Section 4):</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Topological</strong> use a simple topological sort to determine the order of building keys. They are limited to static dependencies - if new dependencies are discovered during the build process, they cannot be correctly added to the build graph.</li>
<li><strong>Restarting</strong> schedulers start building a particular key, then, as dependencies are discovered, abort building that key. Then the discovered dependency(ies) are built, after which the original key’s task is restarted. This allows dynamic dependencies, but at the cost of repeating parts of the build process.</li>
<li><strong>Suspending</strong> schedulers also start building a particular key. When a dependency is discovered, instead of aborting the current task, they suspend it, go and build the dependency, then resume the task. This allows dynamic dependencies without repeating work.</li>
</ol>

<p>Section 4.3 says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This scheduler (when combined with a suitable rebuilder) provides a minimal
build system that supports dynamic dependencies. In our model, a suspending
scheduler is easy to write – it makes a function call to compute each
dependency. However, a more practical implementation is likely to build
multiple dependencies in parallel, which then requires a more explicit task
suspension and resumption. To implement suspension, there are two standard
approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blocking threads or processes: this approach is relatively easy, but can
require significant resources, especially if a large number of tasks are
suspended. In languages with cheap green threads (e.g. Haskell), the
approach is more feasible and it was the original approach taken by SHAKE.</p></li>

<li><p>Continuation-passing style (Claessen, 1999) can allow the remainder of a
task to be captured, paused, and resumed later. Continuation passing is
efficient, but requires the build script to be architected to allow
capturing continuations. SHAKE currently uses this approach.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While a suspending scheduler is theoretically optimal, in practice, it is
better than a restarting scheduler only if the cost of avoided duplicate work
outweighs the cost of suspending tasks. Note, furthermore, that the cost of
duplicate work may often be just a fraction of the overall build cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to show that an implementation of such a scheduler is “trivially”
possible using Futures (Promises for JS folks) and provides the nice property
of automatically giving parallelism, without any need for explicit suspension
and resumption. We do not need to perform any transformations to code. Instead
almost everything is written in a very imperative, blocking style, with
async/await handling the suspension mechanics. Using futures means that we
do not need a thread/process per active task. Since builds are generally I/O
bound and more importantly, running separate processes than the build process,
this means we can even get away with just one actual OS thread running all
currently active futures.</p>

<p>With a “sophisticated” (I don’t know a better word) futures implementation such
as in Rust, you can even make reasonable claims about the memory usage and
allocation patterns of such an implementation, which can help you answer
whether “the cost of avoided duplicate work outweighs the cost of suspending
tasks”.</p>



<p>I am going to focus on a “build system” that has these requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is going to launch arbitrary external processes. This generally makes the
cost of suspending pretty small compared to the cost of restarting.</p></li>

<li><p>We want parallelism because this is 2020. At the same time, we want to bound
this parallelism to avoid overloading a machine.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Just like in a real build system, our tasks can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Depend on N tasks, and cannot begin until all N of those tasks are done. The
code does assume all tasks always succeed, which is not true in reality.</li>
<li>Share common dependencies, so that multiple tasks should be able to block on
a single task.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The examples below use
<a href="https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/hello-world/">tokio</a> and
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/index.html">futures</a> to implement the
runtime and various useful features. They will only run on UNIX since they use a shell.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="simple-suspension">Simple suspension</h2>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=85cde96a0bbd4d3f26b5eceea490e338">Full code in the Rust playground</a></p>

<p>Let’s start small. This one just demonstrates setting up dependencies so that a task waits until they are all done.</p>

<p>First we have a wall of imports, most of which we will only use later.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![allow(unused_imports)]</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::future::join_all;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::future::FutureExt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::stream::FuturesUnordered;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::stream::StreamExt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>std::rc::Rc;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>tokio::process::Command;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>tokio::runtime::Builder;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>tokio::sync::Semaphore;<span>

<p>An async function in Rust does not actually start running as soon as it is
called. Instead, it is desugared to return a Future that has “yield points”
introduced at await calls. <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/">This is an excellent explanation of how Rust
async/await works</a>. The process will only
be launched when <code>status()</code> executes.</p>

<p>A final bit of setup is to create a runtime in which to run the future. This is
a Rust-ism and is not really present in other languages, where it is handled
transparently by the runtime. As I said before, since we are launching
processes which will do the actual work, we aren’t going to use a thread-pool
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. So we select the <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/runtime/struct.Builder.html#method.basic_scheduler">tokio basic
runtime</a>.
Since our demo program doesn’t do anything else, we can just block on the one
async block, and exit as soon as that is done. This section won’t get into much
of the Rust-specific code. See <a href="#implementation-details">the implementation details</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>()<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>runtime<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>Builder::new()<span>

</span><span></span><span>    </span>});<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We are ready to demo a pretend build system.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Goes in the "actual code goes here".
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span>compile1<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>command<span>!</span>(<span>"sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo foo.o"</span>);<span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span>compile2<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>command<span>!</span>(<span>"sleep 2 &amp;&amp; echo bar.o"</span>);<span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span>link<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>join_all(vec<span>!</span>[compile1,<span> </span>compile2]).then(<span>|</span>_<span>|</span><span> </span>command<span>!</span>(<span>"sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo baz.so"</span>));<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>targets<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>FuturesUnordered::new();<span>
</span><span></span>targets.push(link);<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>Some</span>(_)<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>targets.next().await<span> </span>{}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We pretend to compile 2 object files, which can happen in parallel. Then we build a shared library that requires both these files. <code>FuturesUnordered</code> allows waiting on a set of futures, and treating them as a stream of results. Each call to <code>next().await</code> will block until one of the futures in the set is done, and then will return the value of that future. This allows us to simulate a build system that has multiple “top-level” keys (files) being built.</p>

<p>Running this will produce something like <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="text">Starting 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo foo.o'
Starting 'sleep 2 &amp;&amp; echo bar.o'
foo.o
Done 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo foo.o'
bar.o
Done 'sleep 2 &amp;&amp; echo bar.o'
Starting 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo baz.so'
baz.so
Done 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo baz.so'</code></pre></div>

<p>demonstrating that the 2 compiles start roughly at the same time (not blocking on each other) and the link does not start until they are both done.</p>

<p>Why is this a suspending scheduler? Well, the “build system” is requested to run the task <code>baz.so</code>. This task is represented by a Future returned from <code>join_all(...).then()</code>. Internally this generates a state machine that is going to wait on all the futures in the join. This is analogous to discovering that certain dependencies need to be built. <code>join_all</code> then suspends itself. It signals to the runtime that it cannot continue until these other tasks are done, so it shouldn’t be woken up until they are. The dependencies are now “present in the system” <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">3</a></sup>, and they get run to completion. Once they are done, the task resumes from the yield point and finishes itself!</p>

<p>A corollary of this is that the runtime will try to run as many futures (tasks) as it can. Try it! Time to make sure we don’t overload machines.</p>

<h2 id="constraining-parallelism">Constraining parallelism</h2>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=93943d4bf6c87f2315f9b440b1e5ebcd">Full code in the Rust playground</a></p>

<p>How would we impose a limit on how many tasks are running at the same time? Instead of just suspending until a task’s dependencies are ready, we could have the task stay suspended until we had the capacity to run it. We could imagine modeling this as a device that maintains some kind of shared counter. The counter has a maximum value. Each Future obtained from such a device would only be ready when there was capacity in the system. It would decrement the counter and return some handle which the task can use to indicate when it has finished running. That will increment the counter.</p>

<p>This sounds very much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)">semaphore</a> from thread-based parallelism. Indeed, tokio does provide a <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/sync/struct.Semaphore.html"><code>Semaphore</code></a> that behaves exactly like this. It also uses some Rust idioms to make it …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities could allow running arbitrary code on an intranet server and gain root access on all the customers' routers</p>

<p>Telia is a Swedish multinational telecommunications company. It also operates in Lithuania and provides mobile service, FTTH internet, DSL internet and IPTV. Telia rents and sells custom routers and set-top tv boxes to customers which have limited or almost no administration access left to them.</p>

<p>Every Telia router or tv box has a backdoor or "management interface". It is an <code>SSH</code> server running on VLAN 5 and/or WAN. Usually, it is running on port <code>8022</code>. Older models, like <code>ADB</code>, have password login enabled. The recent newer models, like <code>Technicolor</code>, have password login disabled and only use ssh with public key authentication (spoiler: it is still vulnerable).</p>

<p>Savitarna (in Lithuanian "Self service") - is a web service <a href="https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso">https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso</a> that allows Telia customers to order and manage services, get invoices, pay bills etc. It uses password authentication or external authority logins such as Facebook, Google, banking, digital signature etc. One of the new features: changing your router's wifi password. Sounds interesting, right? An internet web service that is able to change your local router's wifi password.</p>
<p>Login page:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-login.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna web login page"></p>
<p>Change wifi settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-wifi-settings.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna WiFi setting change feature"></p>

<p>How that works. When a user wants to change the password, the web service calls the backend to initiate an SSH connection to the user's associated router. Depending on the router it will be either password authentication or RSA public key. After a successful login a PHP script on the backend will issue some commands in the router's shell, parse the result and output some of the data to the user in the web UI, like wireless network name. <strong>Telia knows your WIFI password in plain text</strong>, keep it in mind and do not reuse this password anywhere. Overall scheme:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor-scheme.jpg" alt="Overall scheme of Telia backdoor"></p>

<p>Let's take a look at how the SSH connection is established. Network capture shows an SSH client banner and the remote IP that initiated the connection:</p>
<p><code>SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.4.2 PHP 10.0.98.251</code></p>
<p>What is important here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable <code>libssh2</code> version <code>1.4.2</code> <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/security.html">https://www.libssh2.org/security.html</a></li>
<li>Weak and deprecated key exchange <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code></li>
<li>The client does not verify <code>remote SSH server public key</code> (see below)</li>
<li><code>PHP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And, yes, it turns out that Telia's client does not attempt to verify the remote server's public key. We were able to start a custom SSH server on the same port 8022 and Savitarna successfully established a connection without even trying to verify for a man-in-the-middle. This means that we can see the password used and could try to create a malicious SSH server that exploits public vulnerabilities on Telia's side.</p>

<p>That was an easy task. As soon as Telia's client connected to our malicious SSH server we got the universal router credentials:</p>
<pre>User: tadmin
Password: hqMV8Wps
</pre>

<p>Do you still own an ADB router? Just go ahead and login over the web interface with this user. You are now an admin. You can do some restricted stuff now, great! But what about the root shell? We were able to connect with those credentials locally and got a limited shell. That's nice too. This gave us a lot of additional information that was hidden inside the router, many more vulnerabilities. Using one of them we were able to escalate to root and got full access over the device. The newer models like Technicolor require some additional exploits chained to gain full root access, but all are publicly available and so - easily doable.</p>

<p>In order to exploit RCE we needed to build a virtual test environment that fully copies Telia's PHP client. Step by step we have gone through the sequence of Telia's commands sent over the SSH. And finally we got a malicious SSH server and a test libssh2 client running in our test lab. With this server we could fully control the protocol and start fuzzing.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the fuzzing we got some crashes and partially confirmed that RCE may be exploited. Here is a sample GIF video that demonstrates two kinds of the issues the fuzzer found for us. Same php file was executed twice, but the malicious SSH server sent different payloads which caused:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segfault (stack corruption)</li>
<li>Infinite loop with high CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-poc.gif" alt="GIF PoC video"></p>
<p>However, at the time of the report we couldn't find an easy way to exploit the stack corruption. It may require more time, longer and more sophisticated fuzzing and more knowledge about the server. As Lithuanian law prohibits exploit testing on the real server, we could only fingerprint the Windows OS, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The backend seems to run only 5 php processes, so it is fairly easy to perform DoS by keeping stalled ssh connections. When SSH connections stay active for too long filling all the 5 php processes (there seems to be no timeout reading the remote shell), the Savitarna will show a strange "Maintenance" message:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>An update is in progress
Too many of you are trying to access the new Telia webpage.
We are expanding the resources and will accept you all soon.
Apologies for any inconvenience
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-DoS.jpg" alt="Service unavailbale"></p>

<p>If we now get all together, an attacker could exploit RCE on the intranet server and use that server to move laterally (because <code>10.0.98.251</code> is whitelisted everywhere) across all the customer routers with the same credentials creating the most powerful, persistent and undetectable botnet of Lithuania. Who knows, maybe someone already exploited that? (spoiler: see bonus section)</p>

<p>The report was responsibly disclosed to Telia and a copy sent to <code>CERT LT</code> (<a href="https://www.nksc.lt/">NKSC</a>). What happened next was a little bit of a surprise to the team. There were rumours previously about Telia's poor tech level, but we have experienced this in a real case.</p>
<p>First, Telia did not have a PGP key and did not know how to use it, so instead they asked us to ZIP the report with password and send the password over a separate email (private GMail). I hope Telia's engineers will be reading this article, so I would like to explain why the report should be encrypted. This is to protect you as the affected vendor. If there is a man in the middle who can intercept all the researcher's traffic, it will be very easy to get the ZIP file in the first email and then the password in the second email. Instead, PKI like PGP only allows to decrypt the report by the private key owner, ensuring that nobody else can intercept the report and exploit the vulnerabilities before you fix them all. </p>
<p>Second, Telia tried to threaten the reporter for the vulnerability discovery:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information
Are you sure you did not violate the electronic data protection law?
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>

<p>And then they once again mentioned that they will check if this report wasn't a hacking attempt and that they will persecute any reporter that discloses any information about Telia vulnerabilities:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information. We will continue to check whether you made your report
legally without violating any law. And we will ensure that no fake information will be
published that could do any harm to the company's reputation and to the critical part
of Lithuanian network infrastructure.

<p>We will not comment on this and let the IT community to judge. At the same time we will no longer provide any reports in any form to Telia company.</p>

<p>* Note: partial fix for KEX means the new KEX is not considered to be weak, however it is now possible to exploit libssh2 vulnerabilities after 1.8.0 with this particular KEX and a publicly known exploit for <a href="https://github.com/Semmle/SecurityExploits/blob/446048470633bf0f8da9570d008d056dbaa28ea9/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_kex_CVE-2019-13115/server/home/diff.txt">KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</a></p>

<p>After getting the root access and analyzing the Telia's routers' firmwares, we found several more users, like <code>ladmin</code> and <code>technician</code>. We will not disclose those passwords (yet), as it is not clear yet how both are used. But we were surprised that Telia's passwords appeared to be leaked many years ago. You can try to search for the tadmin password's hash on the web and you will be surprised - there was an attempt to crack the hash back in 2014!</p>

<p>And finally, we found that the hash was cracked and was available in the old "weakpass" database. You can search for the "old" weakpass database (sometimes named "First version of weakpass") and grep it - password is there. This means that most probably we are not the first who were able to penetrate Telia.</p>

<blockquote><p>“He’s perhaps one of two dozen people who knows the name of Iron.”</p><cite>Kvothe, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2Y6Te0T" target="_blank">Name of the Wind</a>, The Kingkiller Chronicles</cite></blockquote>



<p>Names have power. Patrick Rothfuss adeptly harnesses this truth in his excellent novel series The Kingkiller Chronicles. In the word of Temerant, knowing the true name of an element such an Iron or Wind gives someone supernatural control of it.</p>



<p>The power of names is demonstrated through a simple photograph of place signs. Each of the words on the wall above conjures a feeling of excitement, or curiosity, or perhaps a distant memory, fleeting and poignant.</p>



<p>What we choose to call events, concepts and people measurably changes our view of them. The names we given ourselves quietly in our hearts have enormous influence over our mental state.</p>



<p>Astonishingly, recent research has discovered that we even <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000076.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look like our given names</a>. Researchers have shown that people and computers can infer our name by looking at our face, an effect demonstrable beyond socioeconomic cues. Therefore, our facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look.</p>



<h2>The importance of naming for clean code</h2>



<p>This a significant realisation for our mental health and well-being, but how does it fit with delivering clean code faster?</p>



<p>Names communicate. They have the power to tell others what a thing is and does. That reduces friction in our development teams, and allows us to understand code faster and deliver more quickly.</p>



<p>Why should we expend so much effort to get them right? Because the name of a concept gives us insight into how it fits into the system we are designing. Conversely, if we’re not careful with naming, we’ll be producing <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/write-only-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write-only code</a> which drifts apart from the whole, lost and destined for eventual deletion.</p>



<p>Here are some principles you can use to help you choose the best names and produce clean code with less effort. We’ll start with the nuts and bolt of naming code, then move to how to determine meaningful names in conjunction with our customers.</p>



<h2>Intentionally move through the four stages of naming</h2>



<blockquote><p><em>There are two hard problems in computer science: Cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors.”</em></p><cite><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Fowler</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>How should we pay attention to names as we get started with coding something new? J.B. Rainsberger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks about</a>&nbsp;names of classes, methods and variables going through four stages towards clean code:</p>



<ul><li><em>Nonsense:</em>&nbsp;For example, we might extract a method from a larger one and quickly rename it&nbsp;<code>somethingWhatever()</code>&nbsp;to get the refactor done and the tests passing.</li><li><em>Accurate:</em>&nbsp;We rename the nonsense method to what it actually does, such as&nbsp;<code>processPayroll()</code>.</li><li><em>Precise:</em>&nbsp;Once we realise what the method really does, we might refine the accurate name and give it more precision, such as&nbsp;<code>loopThroughEmployeesAndPayThem()</code>.</li><li><em>Meaningful:</em>&nbsp;At this point, we’ve revealed the complexity of the method, and can look to split it up into two methods:&nbsp;<code>forEachEmployee()</code>&nbsp;and perhaps a&nbsp;<code>payWages()</code>&nbsp;method on a separate interface.</li></ul>



<h2>Don’t be afraid of nonsense or longer names</h2>



<p>We shouldn’t shy away from the early stages of naming. If we’re not sure what something is yet, give it a nonsense name. The name&nbsp;<code>foo()</code>&nbsp;is fine, as long as it’s only going to last fifteen minutes.</p>



<p>It doesn’t belong in a commit, and it’s not clean code, but it’s a start. It gets our code moving so we can begin to see how our concepts fit together.</p>



<p>As you progress, some concepts or ideas will outgrow your abstractions. They become ripe for future refactoring. If in doubt as to what or where something fits, use a long name: the longer and more precise the better. I will call a variable something like <code>computed_unsorted_project_task_matrix</code>&nbsp;if I don’t like it and want to refactor it at some point.</p>



<p>This is much more intention revealing than&nbsp;<code>result</code>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<code>res</code>,&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>r</code>). I reveal the complexity of the object through the name, which helps reveal complexity in the code.</p>



<h2>Characters are cheap</h2>



<p>Let’s not make things harder for the programmers who come after us. Remember, this is just as likely to be ourselves in a few months. Let’s avoid using a name like&nbsp;<code>p</code>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<code>project</code>&nbsp;is only a few characters more.</p>



<p>Anything that reduces reading friction in our code is a good thing.</p>



<p>This isn’t fashionable amongst developers in certain languages communities like Clojure or Haskell. They prefer brevity in variable names, relying on convention for understanding. For example, <code>k</code> and <code>v</code> often refer to <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> in a Clojure Map.</p>



<p>The important thing is to reduce friction in the team. If your team are used to these variables, it’ll be quick to understand: for them, it’ll be clean code. However, this will increase the barrier to other team members. In general I prefer longer more meaningful names to this. I don’t think it’s worth sacrificing the team’s understanding for the sake of a few characters. If names are becoming so cumbersome their length is reducing clarity, this shows the need for a refactor.</p>



<h2>Name concepts for your customer, not yourself</h2>



<p>Along the steps we take through to making names more precise and meaningful, how do we choose what words to use for the concepts we’re dealing with? We name these concepts through continual conversations with customers.</p>



<p>Ubiquitous language is an excellent concept and tool that Eric Evans introduced years ago in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3ftKZBF">Domain Driven Design</a>. Every coder would do well to read at least the first half of this book. The idea is often taught within a Behaviour Driven Development context, but it is logically independent. Any agile team can work towards a Ubiquitous Language.</p>



<p>The central idea is that there are two languages that we can use to talk about a concept: the “problem” language or the “solution” language. The problem language is the language of the customer. For example, a payroll system might use concepts like <em>wages, salary, PAYE, tax, paying.</em> The solution language is the language of developmers. For example we might use the following names for the code that runs the payroll system: <em>button, element, value, collection, style, parent-child, container, object.</em></p>



<p>The solution language is where many programmers naturally live, think and speak. It’s easy for us to operate with these kinds of concepts. The trouble is, they’re often alien for our customer. Instead of lazily reaching for <code>parent</code>–<code>child</code> (or the more problematic <code>master</code>–<code>slave</code> vernacular) when describing a concept, let’s instead collaborate with our customers on a shared language that works well for everyone. Perhaps we <em>add an employee to a tax band</em> rather than <em>insert a user into a collection</em>, both <a href="https://deliverydoubled.com/deliver-faster-boost-teamwork-a-simple-guide-to-development-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when discussing the next feature</a>, and when we’re writing the code itself.</p>



<h2>Intentional conversations reduce confusion and produce clean code</h2>



<p>It’s common for teams to have to deal with concepts and words that overlap and interact with each other. Single concepts are called different things by different people on the team. Different groups of people within an organisation use the same word for wholly different ideas.</p>



<p>It’s such a universal problem people often don’t pay attention to it. However confusion and cognitive load will build up and cause communication problems over time.</p>



<p>It’s also fairly easy to solve this problem through having quick, regular, intentional conversations.</p>



<p>Next time you’re discussing a concept with your team that’s poorly named, speak up. Ask whether there’s another name for the concept that could reduce confusion. Try a few different words or phrases out with the team until you settle on the right thing. This might mean inventing entirely new words or concepts that fit well with everyone in the team. That’s ok, as long as it makes our language more precise.</p>



<p>Once a word has been decided on, commit to using it everywhere from now on. Deliberately take the time to update the names in the code to match.</p>



<p>Perhaps you could volunteer to maintain a glossary of words so that everyone feels the benefit. Newer team members are often great people to keep an eye on these documents, and update them whenever they encounter errors.</p>



<p>There’s always going to be a barrier for incoming team members new to our code and our concepts. If we’re having these intentional conversations, we’re helping newer people by creating a smaller set of names for them to learn.</p>



<hr>



<p>Names have power. They can drive insight and influence communication. Let’s intentionally practice our naming as a team, so that everyone has a say about the language and terminology we use. Let’s build those names right into our codebases, moving through the stages towards the team’s language as the code becomes clearer. This will harmonise the team’s work, make for cleaner code, and puts the team on the right track to improving their delivery times.</p>

      <h3>Tutorial: Writing a VM for a Small Stack-Base Language in Pointless</h3>
      <pre>- Avery N. Nortonsmith</pre>

      <hr>

      <p>
        The age of functional programming will soon be over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Object-oriented programming has come and gone. Functional programming -- the wise, quiet observer -- has waited patiently for its turn. But FP, like OOP, will fade away in time as software yields to the inexorable pull of the one <em>True Paradigm</em>: stack-based programming!
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        Joking aside, stack-based programming <em>is</em> pretty cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tutorial covers the implementation of a <strong>virtual-machine</strong> for a small, <strong>stack-based</strong> language in Pointless. We'll take an <strong>incremental</strong> approach to building the VM and improving its capabilities until it can run a short <strong>prime-factorization</strong> program.
      </p>

      This project seeks to demonstrate:

      <ul>
        <li>
          How an imperative language can be implemented in a purely functional context
        </li>

        <li>
          How to structure and refactor code that uses persistent data-structures
        </li>

        <li>
          How Pointless can -- even as a young language -- be used to solve non-trivial tasks
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Before we tackle prime-factorization, let's take a look at a small example of the stack-based code that our VM will evaluate. The following Pointless code defines a <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#lists">list</a> of 'instructions', where <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#tuples">labeled-tuples</a> are used to represent instructions with an argument, and <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#labels">labels</a> are used for those without. A list of instructions like this represents a program in our stack-based language:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Let's take a minute to fancy things up by writing a function to pretty-print these instruction lists -- this will come in handy later when we work with more complex programs. The function <code>showInst</code> below takes an instruction and returns a string showing the instruction's type (left-justified to 5 characters) and argument. The function <code>argOrBlank</code> returns an instruction's argument if there is one, or an empty string otherwise. 
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>showInst(inst) =
 format("[ {&lt;5} ] {}", [getLabel(inst), argOrBlank(inst)])

argOrBlank(inst) =
  if is(PtlsTuple, inst) then unwrap(inst) else ""
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the code above, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/format.html#format">format</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#getLabel">getLabel</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#unwrap">unwrap</a></code> are defined in the Pointless <a href="https://ptls.dev/api/index.html">prelude</a> (standard-library).
      </p>

      <p>
        To see our new functions in action, we'll define an output variable for our program; in Pointless, a program's output is defined by its output variable. The prelude contains functions like <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#printLines">printLines</a></code> which generate sequences of IO commands that can be assigned to a program's output variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The output definition below takes our list of instructions, generates a new list of instruction-strings by calling <code>showInst</code> on each instruction, and produces IO commands to print each string on a separate line. Take a look at the docs for more info on the function <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#pipeOperator">pipe operator</a> <code>|&gt;</code>, and for <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#partialApplication">partial application</a>.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Note that the name 'main.ptls' is chosen arbitrarily; it doesn't have any special meaning
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; map(showInst)
  |&gt; printLines
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

[ Const ] 7
[ Const ] 2
[ Mod   ] 
[ Const ] 0
[ Eq    ] 
[ Print ] 
[ Exit  ]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Seeing is believing. Time to start making our VM.</p>

      <p>
        We'll represent the VM as an <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#objects">object</a> with the following fields:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>slots</code>: used to store "heap" variables (discussed later on)</li>
        <li><code>insts</code>: an array containing the program's instructions</li>
        <li><code>index</code>: the position in instruction array of the current instruction</li>
        <li><code>stack</code>: a linked-list serving as the stack for the VM</li>
        <li><code>outVal</code>: used to get output from VM as program runs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The function <code>vmFromInsts</code> sets up a new VM object for a given list of instructions. The code also adds the label <code>VM</code> to the VM object (objects and tuples can be labeled in Pointless). Object labels can be used to write code that tells different types of objects apart, or simply for documentation (as we do here).
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>vmFromInsts(program) = VM {
  slots  = zeroArray(8)
  insts  = toArray(program)
  index  = 0
  stack  = []
  outVal = None
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        To check that <code>vmFromInsts</code> works, we'll modify our output definition to create and print a new VM object. Note that we've replaced <code>printLines</code> with <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#println">println</a></code> -- <code>printLines</code> expects a sequence of values (and can print these values on-the-fly as they're computed in the case of lists!), whereas <code>println</code> can handle sequence and non-sequences types.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = []; insts = [Const(7) Const(2) Mod Const(0) Eq Print Exit]; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We run the program, and see that <code>println</code> gives us a nice visualization of our initial VM object, fields and all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back to our list of instructions:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        The instructions above do the following -- (once we've implemented them, that is):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>Const(arg)</code> pushes <code>arg</code> onto the VM stack</li>
        <li><code>Mod</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 % v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Eq</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 == v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Print</code> pops a value from the stack and prints it</li>
        <li><code>Exit</code> signals the end of the program</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additionally, each of these instructions will advance the VM to the next instruction after performing the behaviors above. Nice and imperative ;)
      </p>

      <p>
        With this in mind, we see that the program above does the following: loads the values <code>7</code> and <code>2</code> onto the stack, computes <code>7 % 2</code>, loads the value <code>0</code>, compares <code>0</code> with the result of <code>7 % 2</code>, prints the result of this comparison, and exits. In other words, this program tells us whether or not <code>7</code> is even.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we've defined some instructions, let's start evaluating them.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, vm.insts[vm.index])
    vm with $.stack = [unwrap(vm.insts[vm.index])] ++ vm.stack
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Our <code>eval</code> function uses a <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#cond">cond</a></code> conditional -- eventually this will include cases for all instructions, but we'll start with just <code>Const</code> for now. The code above calls the function <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code> to check whether the current instruction has the label <code>Const</code> (where the current instruction is the instruction in the <code>vm.insts</code> array at index <code>vm.index</code>). If <code>is</code> returns true, then conditional evaluates and returns the body of the case expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Structures in Pointless persistent, and thus immutable. As such, our program will never mutate the state of a VM object; rather, it will produce new VM objects. The code above uses <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#viaWith">with syntax</a> (which can handle both shallow and nested updates -- one of Pointless's little innovations) to create a new VM object with a new stack value: the old stack with the instruction argument pushed to the top. The <code>unwrap</code> function is used to get the argument from the <code>Const</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The code above is dense and repetitive! We can improve it by defining a couple of variables. In the new version, <code>inst</code> is the current instruction, and the <code>arg</code> is the argument of that instruction.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We modify the program's output definition to call <code>eval</code> on the VM to evaluate the first instruction, <code>Const(7)</code>. Looking at output, we see that the value <code>7</code> has been pushed to the stack.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        <code>insts</code> field abbreviated for readability
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; eval
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        But wait! We need our <code>Const</code> handler to do one more thing -- advance the VM to the next instruction. To do this, we'll make a new helper function <code>advance</code> that takes a VM object and returns a new VM object with the instruction index incremented. We'll also move the code for pushing a value onto the VM stack into the new function <code>pushVal</code>.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>advance(vm) = vm with $.index += 1

pushVal(arg, vm) = vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Using these two new functions, the code for <code>eval</code> becomes:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm
    |&gt; pushVal(arg)
    |&gt; advance

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 1; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We call the program again and get the result seen above: the new VM object returned by <code>eval</code> has the value <code>7</code> on its stack and its index incremented.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, the entire program looks something like this:
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Note that the comment bars are not necessary, but are helpful for dividing code visually -- it's a habit of mine, like using fake em-dashes. They can also be used to mark API documentation
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; eval
  |&gt; println

program = [

It is also easy for you to <strong>collaborate</strong> with others - again just like how you can work on the same Google Docs file with multiple people, multiple developers can simultaneously edit the same repository and record their individual changes.</p><p>Thanks to these advantages, Git is a <strong>must-know</strong> for anyone looking to enter the world of software development. This post will provide an overview of the most useful commands in Git and when to use them, and also serves as a reference for when you need to brush up on Git.</p><h2 id="the-git-workflow"><a href="#the-git-workflow" aria-label="the git workflow permalink"></a>The Git Workflow</h2><p>There are a lot of Git commands, so it’s useful to group them by topic / use-case. We’ll first consider Git on a single machine, since most of Git’s operations are local and we can then build up to multi-user Git usage.</p><p>Git can either be run using the command line, or using a GUI such as GitHub Desktop. Although the command line may be more intimidating for new developers, it also is far more powerful and you will need to learn it since most GUIs offer limited commands.</p><p>Git commands typically take the form of <code>git &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;args&gt;</code> might be a file path. Commands may also have <em>options</em> specified denoted by a <code>--&lt;option&gt;</code> or a <code>-&lt;single-letter-option&gt;</code> - think of these as adding extra details as to what the command should do. In this guide, I will present the general syntax and you should replace anything in <code>&lt;&gt;</code> with your corresponding value.</p><p>If you are uncertain about the usage of a command, a really useful command is:
<code>git help &lt;command&gt;</code>
which brings up the manual, or for a refresher <code>git &lt;command&gt; -h</code> or <code>git &lt;command&gt; --help</code> (<code>--help</code> and <code>-h</code> are equivalent).</p><h2 id="setting-up-git"><a href="#setting-up-git" aria-label="setting up git permalink"></a>Setting up Git</h2><h3 id="installing-git"><a href="#installing-git" aria-label="installing git permalink"></a>Installing Git</h3><p><strong>Windows</strong>: Head to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a></p><p><strong>MacOS</strong>: Git comes as part of XCode Command Line Tools, so install that. To check if you’ve installed Git already open a Terminal window and type <code>git --version</code> to check which version you have.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong>: Run <code>sudo apt install git-all</code> (Debian-based) in the terminal or <code>sudo dnf install git-all</code> (RPM-based).</p><h3 id="set-up-configuration-file"><a href="#set-up-configuration-file" aria-label="set up configuration file permalink"></a>Set up Configuration File</h3><p>The first thing to do having installed Git is to set up your user name and email address, since these are used to identify you and stored in all snapshots you make. This is stored in a <strong>configuration file</strong> where you store all your preferences.</p><p>You can either edit this <code>.gitconfig</code> file directly using a text editor or <code>git config --global --edit</code> or instead alter specific fields with <code>git config --global &lt;field&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> - we’re interested in the fields <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code>.</p><p>We can also configure the text editor we use for commits using the field <code>core.editor</code> - initially this is set to the system default editor (e.g vi for Linux/Mac). <code>commit.template &lt;template_file&gt;</code> lets you specify a template that comes up whenever you commit.</p><p>There are many other fields, however one particular field I find especially useful is <code>alias</code> which maps commands to abbreviations: <code>alias.&lt;ab&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code>.
e.g. <code>git config --global alias.st "status -s"</code> maps <code>git status -s</code> to <code>git st</code>.</p><p><code>git config --list</code> lists all the fields and values from the config file.</p><h3 id="create-a-git-repository"><a href="#create-a-git-repository" aria-label="create a git repository permalink"></a>Create a Git repository</h3><p>To initialise a .git repository you can use <code>git init</code> or, if you want a copy of an existing repository, you can do <code>git clone &lt;repo_url&gt;</code>.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/317c63680d60850c4b4035e791ecd896/setup.svg" alt="Setup Terminal"></p><h2 id="git-commit-history"><a href="#git-commit-history" aria-label="git commit history permalink"></a>Git Commit History</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/f66fde04be4a0bf374458ed35fff4e77/commit-history.svg" alt="Git Commit History Diagram"></p><p>Git stores data as a series of lightweight “snapshots” known as <strong>commits</strong> - these store the state of the filesystem at that time as well as a pointer to the previous commit(s). Each commit has a unique <em>checksum</em> - the ID Git uses to refer to it.
To keep track of the history, Git has a <strong>HEAD</strong> pointer that points to the first commit (we follow the pointer chain back to see previous commits).</p><p>So we can refer to a commit either by its checksum, or its relation to HEAD, e.g. <code>HEAD~4</code> refers to the commit 4 commits before the HEAD commit.</p><h2 id="the-git-file-system"><a href="#the-git-file-system" aria-label="the git file system permalink"></a>The Git File System</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/4b6c8479c4391d055b65a8d2a2598187/file-system.svg" alt="Git File System  Diagram"></p><p>Git keeps track of files in 3 main sections:</p><ul><li>Working Directory (this is your computer’s filesystem)</li><li>Staging Area (this stores the contents of your next commit)</li><li>HEAD (the most recent commit in the .git repository)</li></ul><p>All of the main file commands boil down to understanding how Git maintains these three sections. A common misconception is that the staging area only stores changes - a better way to think of these is as <strong>3 separate file systems</strong>, each with their own copies of the files.</p><h3 id="view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="view changes in the git file systems permalink"></a>View changes in the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git status</code> displays any files that differ between the 3 sections. Files have 4 states:</p><ul><li><em>Untracked</em> - in Working Dir but no version stored in HEAD or Staging Area (Git doesn’t know about file)</li><li><em>Modified</em> - newer version in Working Dir compared to Staging Area and HEAD. (changes not in next commit)</li><li><em>Staged</em> - newer version in Staging Area and Working Dir compared to HEAD. (ready to be committed)</li><li><em>Unmodified</em> - same version in all 3 sections (i.e. most recent commit has latest version)</li></ul><p>Note: a file can be both modified and staged, if the version in the working directory is newer than that in the staging area, which in turn is newer than the one in the HEAD commit.</p><p>We can use the <code>-s</code> option for <code>git status</code> to get a cleaner (one line per file) output. This displays <strong>??</strong> if a file is not tracked, <strong>red</strong> if modified and <strong>green</strong> if staged.</p><p>To view the actual changes and not just the files that have changed, you can use:</p><ul><li><code>git diff</code> - see the unstaged changes i.e. compare working directory with staging area.</li><li><code>git diff --staged</code> - see the staged changes i.e. compare staging area with HEAD.</li></ul><p>Adding the <code>&lt;file/dir&gt;</code> argument restricts the diff to that those files. e.g. <code>git diff src/</code></p><h3 id="update-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#update-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="update the git file systems permalink"></a>Update the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git add &lt;file/directory&gt;</code> updates the staging area with the version of the file/directory in the working directory.</p><p><code>git commit</code> updates HEAD with a new commit that snapshots the files in the staging area.</p><p><code>git reset &lt;commit&gt;</code> has three potential steps:</p><ol><li>Point HEAD to <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code> (e.g. if rolling back a commit,staging area and working dir will now have newer version of files than HEAD). Also points branch’s HEAD to that commit. (see Branching section)</li><li>Update Staging Area with contents of <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>. (this has the effect of unstaging file changes - only Working dir. has newest version)</li><li>Update Working Dir with contents of Staging Area (has effect of overwriting and destroying changes to data - <strong>dangerous - take care</strong>)</li></ol><p>By default, <code>git reset</code> only runs Step 1 + 2 however, the options <code>--soft</code> (only run Step 1) and <code>--hard</code> (run Step 1, 2, 3) modify its behaviour.</p><p>If we pass a file path, <code>git reset &lt;commit&gt; &lt;file/dir&gt;</code> it limits effect of <code>reset</code> to files in that file path e.g. <code>git reset --soft HEAD~1 src/</code>.</p><p><code>git checkout HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> also has the same effect as <code>git reset --hard HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> - it overwrites the version of the file in the staging area and working directory with the version at HEAD (effectively undoing your changes since the last commit).</p><p><code>git checkout &lt;file&gt;</code> on the other hand (note no <code>HEAD</code>) overwrites the version of the file in the working directory with the version in the staging area (effectively undoing your changes since the last staged version).</p><p>Finally, <code>git rm &lt;file&gt;</code> untracks the file and deletes it from working directory, the option <code>--cached</code> will untrack a file but not delete it from the working directory.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/3a5894bb13482084888f9dbffc12737c/manipulate-files.svg" alt="Git status demonstration"></p><h3 id="ignoring-files"><a href="#ignoring-files" aria-label="ignoring files permalink"></a>Ignoring files</h3><p>Often we don’t want Git to track all of our files in our repository. This might include:</p><ul><li>sensitive files (e.g. passwords.txt)</li><li>huge binary files</li><li>build files that get generated every time you recompile your source code.</li><li>OS/IDE specific files, e.g. <code>.DS_Store</code> for MacOS or <code>.iml</code>for IntelliJ IDE - you want your repo to be as system agnostic as possible.</li></ul><p>We can specify <strong>glob patterns</strong> (think simplified regular expressions) to <strong>match</strong> files that we want to ignore in our <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p><ul><li><code>/___</code> avoids recursivity - only matches it to current directory</li><li><code>__/</code> matches all files in that directory</li><li><code>*___</code> matches all files with that ending</li><li><code>!</code> negates a pattern - i.e. don’t match this</li><li><code>[__]</code> matches a character to any of the characters in the square brackets.</li><li><code>?</code> matches any character</li><li><code>/**/</code> matches nested directories e.g. <code>a/**/d</code> matches <code>a/d</code> <code>a/b/d</code> <code>a/b/c/d</code> etc.</li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">Examples of .gitignore files</a></p><p>You can even use <strong>glob patterns</strong> when using <code>&lt;file/dir&gt;</code> in the other Git commands e.g. <code>git add src/*.css</code> would add all <code>.css</code> files in the <code>src</code> folder.</p><h2 id="commits"><a href="#commits" aria-label="commits permalink"></a>Commits</h2><p>Since commits are the backbone of your version history, it is worth going into them in more depth.</p><p><code>git commit</code> opens up your text editor for you to write a commit message in.

<article>
<p><span>When building your startup you can have a great idea and the perfect market conditions and still come up short. For both your startup and investors, execution is key.</span></p>
<p><span>Just look at this slide I found from Alexander Jarvis on Quora:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" alt="Mark Suster on what startup investors look for in entrepreneurs: 70% of my investment decision of an early-stage company is the team" width="720" height="432" data-image-id="0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" data-width="1085" data-height="651"></figure>
<p><span>You and your startup team, especially at a management level, are a huge factor as to whether you secure investment or if your pitch ends up in an investor’s trash can.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the first person investors look at as they decide whether or not you are deserving of their time and money is you, the founder.</span></p>
<h2><span>What Startup Investors Look For In Entrepreneurs and The Red Flags They Avoid&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Investors, like most educated gamblers, bet on the jockey – not the horse. Making you the most important asset for a successful fundraising round – especially if you have a proven track record. </span><a href="https://medium.com/startupsoft/why-vcs-almost-blindly-invest-in-founders-with-previous-exits-23824334a260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Studies show</span></a><span> that:</span></p>
<h3><em><strong><span>“Successful serial entrepreneurs are more likely to replicate the success of their past companies.” and “Nearly 80% of [startup] unicorns had at least one co-founder who had previously founded a company of some sort.”&nbsp;</span></strong></em></h3>
<p><span>However, regardless of your previous success investors need to get to know you before they consider investing. They need to trust that you can execute your milestones and that you will provide a valuable ROI. To earn their trust and ultimately win them over you need these essential qualities:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Character</span></li>
<li><span>Confidence</span></li>
<li><span>Coachability&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Character</b></h3>
<p><span>Renowned leadership guru </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonsinek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Simon Sinek</span></a><span> states that “People don’t buy </span><b>what you do</b><span>; they buy </span><b>why you do it.</b><span>”</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Start with why -- how great leaders inspire action | Simon Sinek | TEDxPugetSound" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4ZoJKF_VuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><span>If an investor doesn’t know </span><b>why</b><span> you are creating your startup what incentive do they have to invest in you; as opposed to the thousands of other founders out there. If they can’t be sure their money is in the hands of an intelligent, capable, trustworthy founder they are unlikely to commit to a deal.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, they aren’t just planning to invest capital in your business but also their valuable time. They are looking to create a long-term business relationship with you and share their expertise and network. If they don’t like or trust you they simply won’t do it.</span></p>
<p><span>Your character is a critical factor and potential investors will want to answer the following questions about you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Competency</strong> – “Can you do this?” Is the question nearly all financial backers will want the answer to. Demonstrating competence is challenging, but can be made easier if you have been part of (or already founded) a successful startup.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Commitment</strong> – Are you totally invested in your startup? Are you still working for someone else or have you taken the leap?&nbsp; How hard do you work?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Honesty</strong> – Do you tell the truth? Any lies you tell will inevitably backfire. </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Howard Stevenson</span></a><span> (Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School) sums it up perfectly: “The first time you hear anything dishonest come out of a founder’s mouth, you should run, not walk”</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> – More than telling the truth, do you keep your word and deliver on your promises?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Who you are underneath it all</strong> – Aside from the above are you the kind of person they will be happy to introduce to their professional networks? Will they enjoy working with you over the next three to five years?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Confidence</b></h3>
<p><span>It may seem obvious but you need to be confident that you, your idea and your team can overcome the inevitable challenges of founding a startup. You will need to get used to hearing no from investors, clients, banks and even family and friends. It’s important to develop a thick skin and generate self-confidence no matter the hurdles that arise.</span></p>
<p><span>However, there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance – and it’s a line you will need to tread carefully. Overconfidence and arrogance will make you look like a “know-it-all” to investors. If they decide that you won’t be open to guidance and new ideas it will be a deal-breaking red flag and they will walk away. The best way to ensure that you’re portraying confidence and not arrogance is to support your claims with facts and figures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Coachability</b></h3>
<p><span>Do you listen well? Can you learn quickly and effectively? These are two factors essential for investors. They want to feel their time (and money) is well spent and that they are investing in a founder who is open to learning and being mentored.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A good (smart money) investor will want to nurture a mentor-mentee relationship with you. A receptive mind is a vital quality that you will need. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ron-conway/#4900daef67ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Ron Conway</span></a><span>, an active early-stage investor in Google and Paypal (and Founder of </span><a href="https://www.svangel.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>SV Angel</span></a><span>) puts it this way:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Coachability enables a willingness to be open and make the necessary and often numerous course corrections and morphing that startups require.”&nbsp;</i></span></strong></h3>
<h3><b>The Red Flags &amp; Dealbreakers for Investors</b></h3>
<p><span>There are seven “deadly sins” that will leave you investor-less and could potentially harm your reputation. Here they are and how you can avoid them:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>1. Dishonesty</h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned before lies inevitably backfire. Lying about any aspect of your business (or yourself) will plant a seed of doubt into the minds of any potential investor. They will do the necessary research into you and your company to verify your claims before they open their wallets – so be upfront and honest at all times.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>2. Telling Them you Have “No Competition”</h4>
<p><span>Even if your product is the most innovative product the world has ever seen you will either be disrupting an existing market or creating a new market that will quickly fill with investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>3. Saying you “Only Need 1% of the Market Share”<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>This is a great way to show investors that you don’t understand sales or customer CPA (cost-per-acquisition). Instead of talking in market share talk in customers. Specifically how many you need, how much you will spend to get them and how long it will take for you to get to that number.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>4. Failing to Fulfil Your Commitments</h4>
<p><span>When asked about what might kill a potential deal for her clients </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marciasnelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Marcia Nelson</span></a><span> Managing Director of </span><a href="https://www.alberleen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Alberleen Family Office Solutions</span></a><span> said on aspect is when a “startup’s management takes too long to get us requested information – while it may not kill a deal, it will certainly make us more cautious.” Investors want to know that you take your commitments seriously and that you are prepared to fulfil requests in a timely manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>5. Being Desperate</h4>
<p><span>Desperation can break a business partnership before it begins and shows investors that you are unconfident.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>6. Being Arrogant or Defensive<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned above confidence and arrogance are close neighbours and it’s important not to come off too strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>7. An Unwillingness to Listen</h4>
<p><span>Own your weaknesses. Investors will be put off if you act like you have all the answers and don’t need any help. You will need guidance and help on your journey and investors already know that. If you admit your faults and actively seek advice you will be left with a much healthier and more productive business relationship.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a founder, it is </span><b>your responsibility</b><span> to make as easy as possible for investors to say yes to both you and your startup. You have to put yourself in the best position to form a great partnership that will be a lucrative deal for all parties involved. And the next step in that process is choosing your founding team,</span></p>
<h2><span>Choosing Your Co-Founders&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The founder who will lead the company isn’t necessarily the inventor. It is someone who believes in the startup’s idea and product. So much so that they are willing to put their future on the line to turn that idea into a successful company.</span></p>
<p><span>You should try and choose professionals that have the skills you lack. Someone who has a skillset to offer in another part of the business. Their skills should complement yours.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another important factor is ensuring your values, expectations and business goals are aligned. You and your co-founders will become your startup’s core management team. It’s important to be on the same page when it comes to your startup’s mission, business goals, values and timeline.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to ask yourself if your personalities are compatible. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/co-founder-conflict/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9reWxld29uZy8yMDE4LzA3LzI2L2hvdy10by1waWNrLXRoZS1yaWdodC1jb2ZvdW5kZXJzLWFuZC13aHktaXQtaW1wcm92ZXMteW91ci1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEtIKZoxIkLDJGeNlqJVPCniIv_oDI2VMfIzQ8MoJFst1Y1LpVPlj_dgeGnWBxvuTx9vTEPU8-Lvvf4l34V7ZmlCoi71qW367ATIsBoEnNZ0Pybpbb0jkw9IphJ8mm-GJetR8PtNUn8-Pv5Rvdh2cXfZ_aO-Kk5hLP--l9aOGQXp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Gary Tan</span></a><span>, Managing Partner at Initialized Capital and previously at YCombinator puts it perfectly:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" alt="Gary Tan: Co-founder disputes have historically been one of the top reasons startups fail" width="720" height="440" data-image-id="0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" data-width="752" data-height="460"></figure>
<p><span>Will you be able to embrace the conflict with this person? Discussing disagreements on a level playing field to improve your business?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It comes down to one overarching question:</span></p>
<h4><b>Can you work together over a long period of time? </b></h4>
<p><span>After all, what good is it if their hard skills complement yours if you don’t actually like the person you have chosen as your cofounder?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Investors will take the dynamics of your relationship into account as they assess if your startup will be the right fit for their portfolio. As well as assessing your co-founder on the same essential qualities they judged you on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend that you thoroughly and carefully consider a business partner as you would a life partner. Ask yourself, if in the toughest times will that person remember that you are both on the same team and be by your side? More importantly, will they be an asset to your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Serial entrepreneur, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/amiller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Andy Miller’s</span></a><span> formula is simple: </span><b>People</b><span> + </span><b>Execution </b><span>= </span><b>Success</b><span>. Your potential investors are counting on you and your startup management team to execute on your business plan, gain traction and, ultimately, bring in revenue no matter the hurdles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your founding team’s primary responsibility is to plan your journey to market that avoids potential roadblocks. Then, when unexpected roadblocks do inevitably appear, you and your founding team use that plan to navigate them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seansheppard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Sean Sheppard</span></a><span> puts it:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Most companies and innovations fail, and the reasons have to do with markets and the behaviours of the people who are running them, not the products themselves”.</i></span></strong></h3>
<p><span>You need to be able to trust and count on your co-founders. Choose correctly and you will have a strong foundation on which to move onto the next step: building a startup team.</span></p>

A little animated me that responds to the cursor position.</p><p data-height="580" data-theme-id="dark" data-preview="true" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="WNQqZJG" data-pen-title="lil' me."><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/WNQqZJG">lil' me.</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>In this post we'll cover how to get values from the mouse movement and plug them into an animation.</p><p>This is my <strong>favourite</strong> thing about SVG animation. Not mouse movement in particular, but interactivity. Exporting animation as an mp4 is cool and all. But you can't <em>play</em> with it.</p><p>Animating on the web opens up so many cool possibilities!</p><p>If you're the kind of person who learns best by digging into the code, then just go ahead and fork that pen, have fun!</p><hr><p>Still here? 😊 Cool beans, let's go through it together.</p><p>I use <a href="https://greensock.com/">Greensock</a> for all my SVG animation. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it gives you more control and is super fun to use. But more importantly, as browsers implement the SVG spec differently, animating can get a bit messy. The team at Greensock put a lot of effort into harmonizing behavior across browsers.</p><p>Under the hood though, Greensock is just a really performant property manipulator. It will manipulate (pretty much) whatever value you want to change. In this case it's updating the values in a matrix transform. Check this out.</p><p><img src="https://www.cassie.codes/images/cursor.gif" alt="gif of matrix transforms updating with dev tools open" loading="lazy"></p><p>Cool right! Greensock is great at this kind of thing, but there's a lot going on in this pen, so let's break it down into chunks and focus on one bit at a time. First up, the mouse interaction. We'll come back to Greensock in a bit!</p><h2 id="heading-mouse-movement-fun!">Mouse movement fun!<a href="#heading-mouse-movement-fun!"><span role="text"> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So, there's another way we can modify values in CSS with Javascript. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties!</a></p><p data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="OJMOLML" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/OJMOLML">Mouse movement demo</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>Let's walk through the process. The goal is to get the x and y position of the cursor as we move our mouse about, and then we can use those values to update some custom properties.</p><p>In the previous gif Greensock is using matrix transforms, which are more performant. But we're going to use <code>transform: translate(x,y)</code> for this as it's a tad more readable, and we can use percentage values.</p><p>First up, we declare some custom properties for the x and y values and then use those custom properties in place of regular property values in our transform.</p><pre><code><span><span>:root</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-x</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-y</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>.pointer</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-x<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-y<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Then we need to get our mouse coordinates. We can do this by listening to the mouse movement and getting the mouse's coordinates with <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code></p><p>We'll assign those values to some global variables so that we can access them in another function later.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>updateMouseCoords</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  xPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientX<span>;</span></span><br><span>  yPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientY<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'mousemove'</span><span>,</span> updateMouseCoords<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we've got our coordinates, lets use them to update our custom properties and move our pointer around!</p><p>😇 When animating things on the web it's important to pay attention to performance. We can't know for sure how many times a users mouse event will fire as it's implementation specific. If it fires more than 60 times per second (which is the average refresh rate for most browsers) we'll end up with unnecessary computation. So to avoid burning up everyone's laptop fans and melting their CPU we can use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code></p><p>Request animation frame allows us to make smoother, browser optimized animations. If the user changes tabs, the animation will stop and give the CPU a break. You call the function once to start, and then it recusively calls itself.</p><p>⚠️ This is a great way to crash your browser if you get some code wrong!</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Right now, the x and y position we're getting back from <code>event.clientX</code> and <code>event.clientY</code> are pixel values, this isn't really useful to us. If we plug them straight into our custom properties we could end up transforming our pointer hundreds of pixels off in one direction.</p><p data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="5ed677605b34f86eeb488b4b2a9bfe6a" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/5ed677605b34f86eeb488b4b2a9bfe6a">Mouse movement demo</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>We need to convert those pixel values into percentages of the window height and width.</p><p>Let's define some global variables for the window width and height and work out the percentage values.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> windowHeight <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerHeight<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> windowWidth <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerWidth<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span><span>partialValue<span>,</span> totalValue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> partialValue<span>)</span> <span>/</span> totalValue<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  x <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>xPosition<span>,</span> windowWidth<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  y <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>yPosition<span>,</span> windowHeight<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>  window<span>.</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>This will give us a range from 0 - 100, which would just move our pointer downwards and to the right, so we can shift the range by subtracting 50.</p><p>Once we've got our nice centralised range, we can plug it into our custom properties using <code>setProperty()</code></p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> windowHeight <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerHeight<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> windowWidth <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerWidth<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span><span>partialValue<span>,</span> totalValue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> partialValue<span>)</span> <span>/</span> totalValue<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  x <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>xPosition<span>,</span> windowWidth<span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>50</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  y <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>yPosition<span>,</span> windowHeight<span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>50</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  document<span>.</span>documentElement<span>.</span>style<span>.</span><span>setProperty</span><span>(</span><span>'--mouse-x'</span><span>,</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span>%`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  document<span>.</span>documentElement<span>.</span>style<span>.</span><span>setProperty</span><span>(</span><span>'--mouse-y'</span><span>,</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>%`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>  window<span>.</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>The user might resize the browser, so it's good to check for that.</p><pre><code><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>updateWindowSize</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  windowHeight <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerHeight<span>;</span></span><br><span>  windowWidth <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerWidth<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'resize'</span><span>,</span> updateWindowSize<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>We can also avoid unnecessary calculations when the mouse position hasn't changed by storing past x and y positions and comparing them to the new positions.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>let</span> storedXPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> storedYPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  window<span>.</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>storedXPosition <span>===</span> xPosition <span>&amp;&amp;</span> storedYPosition <span>===</span> yPosition<span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  storedXPosition <span>=</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span>  storedYPosition <span>=</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>😇 another <em>super important</em> bit is checking whether the user has a preference set in their OS for reduced motion.

First we have to include the core library, if you're on codepen, you can go to your pen settings and search for greensock.</p><p><img src="https://www.cassie.codes/images/gsap-include.png" alt="pen settings on codepen" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now we've got the GSAP library in our pen, we can take advantage of <code>gsap.ticker()</code></p><p>The greensock ticker is like the heartbeat of the GSAP engine - under the hood it uses requestAnimationFrame, just like we were using, but if that isn’t supported, the ticker automatically falls back to using a regular setTimeout() loop.</p><p>So rather than calling our function with request animation frame, we would do this...</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>gsap<span>.</span>ticker<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Aside from making structuring animation itself more intuitive, Greensock provides a load of super cool utility functions that make your life easier. Remember all that work we did to get a nice usable range? Chuck that all in the bin. Look what we can do now!</p><pre><code><span></span><br><span><span>let</span> mapWidth<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> mapHeight<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>setMaps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  mapWidth <span>=</span> gsap<span>.</span>utils<span>.</span><span>mapRange</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> innerWidth<span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  mapHeight <span>=</span> gsap<span>.</span>utils<span>.</span><span>mapRange</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> innerHeight<span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'resize'</span><span>,</span> setMaps<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>setMaps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can listen to the mouse movement, feed <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code> into mapWidth, and we'll get back a value within the range we've set!</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>updateMouseCoords</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  xPosition <span>=</span> <span>mapWidth</span><span>(</span>event<span>.</span>clientX<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  yPosition <span>=</span> <span>mapWidth</span><span>(</span>event<span>.</span>clientY<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'mousemove'</span><span>,</span> updateMouseCoords<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>So tidy and concise!</p><p>Instead of updating CSS custom properties, we're going to use a Greensock tween. A Tween is what does all the animation work, as I said at the start, it's like a high-performance property manipulator.</p><p>A tween takes in two parameters</p><p>The targets, which are the object(s) whose properties you want to animate. Greensock uses <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> internally so we can use any CSS selector we would use in CSS, or a direct reference to an element.</p><p>And the vars, an object containing all the properties/values you want to animate, along with any special properties like delay, ease, or duration.</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  gsap<span>.</span><span>to</span><span>(</span>pointer<span>,</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    xPercent<span>:</span> xPosition<span>,</span></span><br><span>    yPercent<span>:</span> yPosition<span>,</span></span><br><span>    ease<span>:</span> <span>'none'</span></span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    </span><br><span>  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>gsap<span>.</span>ticker<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>I've added a couple more easing equations in here so you can change them out and see what a difference it can make to the movement.</p><p data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-preview="true" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="rNxYpzO" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo - GSAP - easing"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/rNxYpzO">Mouse movement demo - GSAP - easing</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>If you want to focus more on performance than easing you can use gsap.quickSetter to update the transforms.

<a href="https://rakhim.org/index.xml">RSS</a></p></nav><hr><article><p>There's this thing called <strong>fundamental attribution error:</strong></p><blockquote><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology">social psychology</a>, <strong>fundamental attribution error</strong> (<strong>FAE</strong>), also known as <strong>correspondence bias</strong> or <strong>attribution effect</strong>, is the tendency for people to under-emphasize situational explanations for an individual's observed behavior while over-emphasizing dispositional and personality-based explanations for their behavior. This effect has been described as “the tendency to believe that what people do reflects who they are”</p></blockquote><p>Basically, when you make a mistake — it's due to some good reason, but when someone else makes a mistake — it's because they are bad people who make mistakes.</p><p>I was thinking about this pattern of observing reality when reading other people's blog posts describing life situations, technical setups, whatever. Let's say I'm reading about some developer's perfect programming environment setup. They share all the steps involved in creating this extremely complex system with automation, lots of inter-connected software, scripts and hardware addons. In the end, they conclude with how happy they are about the setup, how it helped their productivity and everything is peachy.</p><p>Inspired, I try to reproduce a <em>portion</em> of the described system, but quickly face the reality: things aren't connecting as nicely as I expected, bugs and compatibility issues force me to write dirty hacks, and in the end the whole thing is just waiting to break.</p><p>I'm not doing this anymore nowadays. Every time I see a cool setup, be it OS, Terminal, Emacs, Vim or even some iOS automations, I just think how hard it is to maintain all of that and go to my Emacs config looking for something new to disable.</p><p>But for the longest time I seem to have been making a Fundamental Attribution of Ability Error. I was thinking that people's setups are in fact perfect. That there's something wrong with me, that my attempts to build a convoluted architecture fail because I'm a bad programmer. With experience and after talking to a lot of people, I realized how much of a facade many of us create when describing our creations.</p><p>No, your Emacs setup does not have “zero issues”. Sorry, I don't believe you. It has issues and it breaks and you fix it sometimes. No, your Karabiner + Hammerspoon + AppleScripts + KeyboardMaestro setup with two hundred custom keyboard shortcuts is not “maintenance free”. No, your dotfiles repo with Ansible script does not guarantee a one-command-setup on a new machine.</p><p>As a result, I'm finding myself more and more conservative and pragmatic. ‘Vanilla’ and ‘default are my favorite words. I don't get into zsh or fish, even though I understand the benefits over Bash. Bash is okay. My small config with a bunch of aliases had served me well. I love Doom Emacs, but I come back to my minimalist personal configuration with continuously shrinking number of customizations. I use Make and Bash-scripts for building.</p><p>Mythical “reproducible configuration” does not exist. I mean, it does, with scripts, Ansible, Docker or nixOS, sure, but then you have to constantly maintain the thing that creates maintenance-free environments. Is there a catch here?..</p></article></main></div></div>]]>

And research is suggesting masks might be the way to avoid another lockdown.</p>  <p>Two studies published in the journal <em>Nature</em>&nbsp;calculate up the number of lives that were saved by aggressive lockdown measures.</p>  <p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8" target="_blank">first study</a>, from the University of California Berkeley, looked at six countries around the world, including China, the U.S., South Korea, Iran, France and Italy, and found that without lockdown measures, a half a billion more people would have been infected, with millions of deaths as a result.</p>  <p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7" target="_blank">second study</a> that looked at 11 European countries found that lockdown measures saved more than three million lives.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Epidemiologist&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/fisman-david-n/" target="_blank">Dr. David Fisman</a>&nbsp;from the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health said these findings mirror what he and his colleagues discovered&nbsp;when they looked at how effective the timing of lockdown measures were in Ontario. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2945" target="_blank">They found</a>&nbsp;that if the lockdown had occurred one month later, there would have been around 15,000 deaths, which doesn't even include long-term care homes, "as opposed to the 600 or so that we've had from the community."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt=""

avoid another lockdown</h2>  <p>"If we're opening up our economy, that implicitly says we're going to be having more contacts with each other. So a way to counterbalance that is by decreasing the probability of transmission per contact," said Fisman.</p>  <p>Fisman said masks can reduce the risk of a person getting infected by someone else, but more importantly with COVID-19, they also make it less likely that an infected person will pass on the virus.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Fisman told <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks"><em>Quirks &amp; Quarks</em></a> host Bob McDonald about <a href="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/13319/face-masks-considerably-reduce-covid-19-cases-in-germany-a-synthetic-control-method-approach" target="_blank">a study</a> from &nbsp;Germany that looked at effectiveness of mandatory mask use, which they rolled out at different times in different regions.</p>  <p>He said mask use "almost acts like a shock in these models. They introduce the masks and bang — a week later, transmission is down."</p>  <p>This is why Fisman co-authored <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1uUGoH0MsUwmlnOwQbbhyyRh8y4wQhG3SkFs3M-8CjEk/mobilebasic" target="_blank">an open letter</a> to federal and Ontario provincial public health officials calling on them to mandate mask wearing in certain situations, so we can open up the economy while still protecting ourselves.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If, as we open up the economy, the virus starts spreading out of control again like it did prior to the lockdown, then Fisman said masks likely wouldn't be enough to halt the spread and to prevent us from tipping over into exponential growth. For that, he said, we needed a lockdown.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>Produced and written by <a href="https://twitter.com/SonyaBuyting" target="_blank">Sonya Buyting</a></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>I have been using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura sleep tracking ring</a> for almost two years now. I immediately fell in love with the form factor, as I can’t stand watches or bracelets.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://ouraring.com/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="256" height="156" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<h2>When do I wear it?</h2>



<p>I used to wear it all the time, but then switched to night-only. I’m not interested in tracking my steps or any of the other activity features. </p>



<p>It also provides an interesting airport security case study: </p>



<p>Turns out that airport security doesn’t care about the Oura ring. Every time I try to put it off, they say “no no, keep the ring on”, and it never beeped or anything, even though it’s an electronic device.</p>



<h2>Main use cases?</h2>



<p>I mainly use it to observe my body temperature at night. It’s a great early warning system for infections.</p>



<p>Also for my “readiness”. It indicates how restful my night was, informing the intensity of my workouts. I‘ve especially found that “low readiness” combined with an “intense workout” is a really bad combination. Instead I use the earliest signs to „listen to my body“</p>



<p>Another important factor is seeing if I got enough REM sleep.</p>



<h2>What have I learned so far?</h2>



<p>I’ve learned that <a href="https://remo.org/2020/05/28/bedtime/" data-type="1791">time in bed doesn’t equal time asleep</a>. Just because you’ve been in bed for 7 hours doesn’t mean you slept for 7 hours. It’s more likely that you slept 6. Based on my ring, my own difference is 30 to 60 minutes per night.</p>



<p>I’ve also learned more about my sleep cycle. For the first few hours, my body focuses on deep sleep. Towards the morning, the focus is shifted to REM sleep. To feel fully rested, I both need enough deep as well as REM sleep. Especially the REM sleep seems to be the most important factor for me.</p>



<h2>Sick vs. Healthy</h2>



<p>Here is a comparison between me being sick and healthy. Your sleep quality is always summarized into a “readiness” score, which makes it easily comparable.</p>

<h2>How accurate is it?</h2>



<p>At the time I bought the ring, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0141983760/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534409176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=why+we+sleep&amp;tag=remouherek-21">Why We Sleep</a>, Matthew Walker, has said that this ring was probably the most accurate sleep tracking device for retail consumers. As I loved Matthew’s book, I trust his judgement.</p>



<h2>Hardware</h2>



<p>The battery lasts for 5-7 days, which is fine. The ring does introduce a new charging device to your life—but I guess we got used to charging device inflation, right?</p>



<p>I also like that the ring is waterproof, so you can wash your hands with it, or take a shower. </p>



<p>After 9 months, I had to have my ring replaced on warranty, because the battery life dropped to 1-2 days, and the whole process was very smooth. I never had any problems with my second ring.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>I love the mobile app. The ring connects via bluetooth and the syncing takes about 20 seconds. The ring receives regular firmware updates, which are also performed through the app.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you care about your sleep and health, I highly recommend using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura ring</a>.</p>



<p>As a last comment, I strongly believe that the company should be acquired by Apple, as I believe that it would fit nicely into the Apple wearables ecosystem and provide a wonderful new form factor.</p>

<p><em>You can find the first article in the series <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-to-program/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>And the previous article <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-programming-part-3/">here</a></em></p>
<h2 id="lovemaintenanceworkoratleastlearntoappreciateit">Love maintenance work or at least learn to appreciate it</h2>
<p>Very few things are more despised by programmers than doing maintenance work and working with legacy apps.</p>
<p>This can be counterproductive, as most of the work available involves doing exactly that. Companies have running systems, some built a long time ago, and someone needs to maintain that code. This is especially true if you are starting at an entry position, where you'll most likely work on some old application the company has been running for more than a decade.</p>
<p>We love working on new projects for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can choose which technology to use.</li>
<li>We can flex our creatives muscles and create something cool.</li>
<li>There's a lot of freedom when designing the solution.</li>
<li>You get to work on The Next Big Thing and all the credit it carries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The huge difference between how we perceive maintenance work and new project development is a sad thing. On one hand, most of the really important job with high impact happens on those legacy systems, whereas The Next Big Thing often goes bust. On the other hand, that cool new app will be legacy as soon as it hits production and you start receiving new requirements.</p>
<p>We should start seeing maintenance work under a more positive light. After all, most of the value provided to end users happens on those systems. We could exercise our creative muscles by refactoring and improving the design, or increasing the test coverage, all proper challenges for developers of any level.</p>
<p>Learn to love maintenance work, it's most likely what you'll spend doing most of the time as a programmer.</p>
<h2 id="makeaccomplishmentsvisible">Make accomplishments visible</h2>
<p>You are an awesome developer, always finishing tasks on time, writing ultra-complete test suites and providing to customers exactly what they want. You do a great job every day and work extra hard to ship those last-minute features. Then, that time of the year when promotions are given arrives and you... you are still in the same position?</p>
<p>I know it can be extremely frustrating, and you might end up resenting management. After all, aren't you always doing an outstanding job? how dare they pass this chance to show me how much they appreciate my hard work!</p>
<p>In reality, managers are just too busy to keep track of your accomplishments. It's your responsibility to make your contribution visible to management.</p>
<p>It doesn't even require too much effort. Keep a list of the most important things you accomplish every week, and send small reports at the end of the week listing what you accomplished. You don't need to generate a fancy document: an email with bullet points will do.</p>
<p>It has two important advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management doesn't need to pester you to get an idea of what you are doing at work.</li>
<li>You keep a registry of your accomplishments, which is useful for negotiating raises and other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a proactive stance on the way management evaluates you, one of the biggest mistakes you can make is to outsource that responsibility to people who are already too busy with other things. Management will appreciate it, and so will you.</p>
<h2 id="fighttheimpostersyndrome">Fight the imposter syndrome</h2>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You got your first software development job. The idea of being interviewed made you feel very anxious, but you studied hard and aced the whole thing. Finally, you arrive at the office on your first day and...</p>
<p>And it's terrifying. Suddenly, you feel like a Jon Snow who knows nothing, and self-doubt starts to creep in. What if they find out I am not that smart? do I really deserve this job? am I a fraud? how long will it take them before they find out I'm a fraud and the horrible mistake they made by hiring me?</p>
<p>The following weeks don't help that much. Perhaps it's a technology you are not that familiar with, or maybe they ask you to work on some dark corner of their massive legacy application. Solving the tasks take you twice (or more) as long as the estimate, and you grow more and more anxious.</p>
<p>Been there, more than once.</p>
<p>It's all normal, the good old imposter syndrome. It's this feeling that you are fake, and that you don't deserve to be there. It will go away after a couple of weeks and you'll start to feel more confident. Ramp-up takes time, and in truth, no one really expects you to be 100% productive from the start. Your employer knows it will take some months before you know what you are doing, so don't punish yourself that hard.</p>
<p>Keep working hard, in no time you will become an important part of the team and your contributions will start to have an impact. We've all felt it, and I guarantee you it will go away. So keep up the good work!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p>There are countless articles on the web that talk about what investors look for when funding your&nbsp;startup. Normally they all focus on similar things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stunning pitch deck</li>
<li>Solid financials</li>
<li>Market opportunity</li>
<li>A founding team with the “X-Factor”</li>
<li>Execution capability</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which are, undeniably, important. But even if you<em> think </em>you have everything figured out, the numbers don’t lie. Few startups successfully raise capital and <a href="https://altar.io/raising-capital-for-a-startup-first-steps-to-a-great-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://altar.io/raising-capital-for-a-startup-first-steps-to-a-great-deal/">even fewer get a good deal</a>.</p>
<p>So what’s different for the founders that do secure funding? What secrets do they know that the rest are oblivious to?</p>
<p>To find out, I sat down (virtually) with Startup expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulobrien/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulobrien/">Paul O’Brien</a>, CEO of <a href="https://mediatech.ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://mediatech.ventures/">MediaTech Ventures</a>, to take a closer look at the hidden details behind startup funding and the information you absolutely need to know that often lurks beneath the surface.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*o6iG3lyonjpbkc8D" alt="Expert Interview: The Hidden Details When Funding Your Startup - Paul O'Brien, CEO MediaTech Ventures #1" width="720" height="479" data-image-id="0*o6iG3lyonjpbkc8D" data-width="1440" data-height="958"></figure>
<h3>About Paul&nbsp;O’Brien</h3>
<h4>Q: Can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you&nbsp;do</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>I grew up in the midwest of the United States when the economy was rough there. Then I ended up in Silicon Valley when Yahoo, Google &amp; Facebook emerged so I’ve experienced both sides of an economy. And how an economy, how a workforce and how entrepreneurs can actually suffer if there isn’t an intentional investment in the entire ecosystem, the entire economy.</p>
<p>So I live now in Austin, Texas. And as the United States is shifting — because of cost it’s shifting a lot of attention from the coasts to other parts of the world. Most of that in the US is coming to Texas. So <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/austin-is-top-place-for-startups-in-america-not-silicon-valley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/austin-is-top-place-for-startups-in-america-not-silicon-valley.html">Texas is largely considered a future hub of innovation</a> for the entire US, and frankly the entire world.</p>
<p>And so here, now, I serve that economic development to help venture capital make more meaningful investments in innovation. I do that very distinctly in the media industry. We focus on everything from podcasting technology to the next Hulu, to the next Spotify, to what’s going on in the video gaming business.</p>
<h4>Q: How long have you been advising startups on investment and economic&nbsp;growth?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>I’ve been doing this work in a broad sense for, [smiles] how old am I, maybe about 20 years back in Silicon Valley. I started my career at Yahoo and so essentially when I was done with Yahoo I worked with Hewlett Packard for a couple of years. And then I started working with startups so it’s been quite a while that I’ve been working with startups seeking Venture Capital funding in particular.</p>
<p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://altar.io/startup-series-funding-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startup Series Funding: Everything You Need To Know</a></p>
<h4>Q: Do you focus on Pre-Revenue or Post-Revenue Startups?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>They are very<em> very</em> different areas of focus. I think the mistake that most founders and service providers make is they treat startups as though pre-revenue and post-revenue work, mentorship, and priorities are all the same. They’re not.</p>
<p>What we do at MediaTech Ventures is we work through incubators, and we run an incubator of our own, to work with that pre-revenue sort of “Seed stage”. What I mean by that is we work to develop methodologies for programs, companies, and even cities and countries, that enable us all to better support those early founders at scale.</p>
<p>Frankly, most founders and most startups at that earlier stage all tend to need the same advice and direction, maybe with some nuance [smiles]. But frankly, that <strong>early-stage tends to have all of the same issues</strong>.</p>
<p>I more personally work at the later stage, essentially the Series A &amp; Series B stage which is why we use the word venture capital so distinctly. I tend to work with Venture Capital funds and firms and<em> their </em>interests in particular. And, of course, VCs don’t participate at the seed stage and hence they’re very different stages to be working. I tend not to work beyond that. I don’t work Series C, I don’t work very much with larger companies or in M &amp; A (Mergers &amp; Acquisitions).</p>
<h3><em><span>“I think the mistake that most founders and service providers make is they treat startups as though pre-revenue and post-revenue work, mentorship and priorities are all the same. They’re&nbsp;not.”</span></em></h3>
<h4>Q: So your main focus is VC, but do you also make introductions to Angel Investors &amp; Private&nbsp;Equity?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes, our main focus is Venture Capital funding, and not because we can’t work with others. Certainly, private equity participates at every stage, mostly later stage but really every stage.</p>
<p>The distinct difference, of course, is that a Venture Capital firm and a fund has a fiduciary responsibility to invest. That’s why <em>the thing </em>exists, they’re obligated to invest. And the partners there have no choice. The limited partners don’t give money to a Venture Capital fund just to sit on it. So it’s a very distinct stage and tends to focus at the middle.</p>
<p>Private Equity is very different because, of course, private equity can do whatever it wants! [laughs] It can completely ignore startups if they’d like to. So, I tend not to work there just because private equity has too many differences, too many nuances.</p>
<p>I work with private equity <strong>as it pertains to our sector, to our industry in particular</strong>. So we work with a lot of media industry private equity. But unless they’re focused on the media industry, we don’t bother. Because they can be all over the place. Whereas Venture Capitalists tend to have all the same expectations at a certain stage.</p>
<p>To answer the question more explicitly we tend not to make introductions to Angels because of our thesis on how best to do that and how that should work. We do make introductions to Venture Capitalists. We don’t broker deals, I don’t believe in getting paid a percentage of equity to connect VCs. We certainly do make introductions, I believe that startups that are worth being funded ethically deserve to be known to investors who want to invest in startups. So we try not to monetise that happening and we make introductions as best we can at the venture capital stage.</p>
<p>What we do at the angel stage, or seed stage is actually the opposite. We have a database of a lot of seed-stage media startups and instead,<strong> we enable the Angel community to actually see that a little bit more transparently</strong>. So basically instead of introducing Angels, because of our thesis about how and why to connect with Angels, we instead more <strong>aggressively promote and expose what seed-stage startups are doing</strong> so that angels are aware of it and consider them if they want to.</p>

<h3>The Hidden Details When Funding Your Startup</h3>
<h4>Q: An early-stage startup has a lot to do and one of the things you need is capital. Do you think it’s meaningful to have investors on board who are experts in startups and/or a specific sector and can provide connections (Smart Money)? Or do you just need someone who can give you a cash injection?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>It’s a great question. That’s a question that I talk about nearly every day with people. Here’s Why:</p>
<p>First, you have to distinguish a <strong>startup </strong>from a <strong>new business</strong>. A new business is not a startup. A new business knows its business model. A new business can make money <em>right now</em>. A new business, a restaurant or an agency, for example, is not a startup. They can go and sell to customers immediately. And in that context, your clarification makes some sense. Should you go talk to a bank? Yeah! Of course! [laughs] Should you find a business partner who’s an investor? Absolutely! Because we can go capitalise this business and make money with it right now.</p>
<p>Startups are<em> not at all</em> the same thing. And it’s very important that the industry, and the world, <strong>appreciate the distinction</strong>. It tends not to because the word “startup” is very popular. Everybody wants to call themselves a startup because it’s sexy. But we can’t! It’s not the same thing. A startup does not know its business model — <strong>a startup by definition does not know how to make money</strong>. And there’s nothing wrong with that — that’s the definition of a startup: “I have an idea, I have a technology, I have a patent, I have something with which I cannot make money right now because I don’t know how to yet. We haven’t figured out how to yet.”</p>
<h3><em><span>“A new business is not a startup. And it’s very important that the industry, and the world, appreciate the distinction. It tends not to because the word “startup” is very popular. Everybody wants to call themselves a startup because it’s sexy. But we can’t! It’s not the same&nbsp;thing.”</span></em></h3>
<p>My favourite example of that is something that recently happened: <strong>ridesharing</strong>.</p>
<p>Lyft was <em>not</em> a startup (at least not the way most should think of it as one). We called it a startup but it wasn’t. Because the startup in ridesharing occurred years before that.</p>
<p>Lyft was the <strong>second mover — “A</strong> <strong>new business in ridesharing”</strong>. So Lyft was <em>definitely </em>not a startup because they looked at what Uber did and just did the same thing. And, of course, throughout the world, we have a bunch of people trying to create ridesharing apps and local businesses for ridesharing. None of those are startups because we already know <strong>how the business of ridesharing works</strong>.</p>
<p>So, a startup <strong>being net new</strong>, always… <em>always</em> the biggest mistake founders make is they try to raise capital to start. Here’s the bottom line:<strong> no startup in the history of the world can raise money just to get going. </strong>Unless you’re Elon Musk, unless you’re Mark Zuckerberg, no one is going to give anybody money just to start something.</p>
<p>So startup finance<em> has</em> to start with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Their own savings</li>
<li>Their own debt</li>
<li>Friends and family</li>
</ol>
<p>Period. The research is there, the reason the average age of success for a startup founder is <a href="https://altar.io/managers-improve-become-successful-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://altar.io/managers-improve-become-successful-entrepreneurs/">45 years old, <strong>and not 20</strong>,</a> is that they have savings and have money to spend. Period.</p>
<h3><em><span>“No startup in the history of the world can raise money just to get going. Unless you’re Elon Musk, unless you’re Mark Zuckerberg, no one is going to give anybody money just to start something.”</span></em></h3>
<h4>Q: That’s really interesting, there’s a couple of examples that are a bit different that might change the …</h4></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Install and upgrade of Docker Engine is simple and straightforward process.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover all important information in one place.</p>

<p>Minimum requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>8GB RAM per manager node</li>
<li>4GB RAM per worker node</li>
<li>3GB of free disk space</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended production requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>16GB RAM per manager node</li>
<li>4 vCPUs per manager node</li>
<li>25-100GB of free disk space on each node</li>
</ul>
<p>Also you must have one of the following OS:</p>
<ul>
<li>CentOS 7.1+ 64 bit version</li>
<li>Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/19.10 64 bit versions</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferable storage driver on newer OS is <code>overlay2</code>.<br>
Docker engine will set it by default.</p>
<p>If you want to get to know what is storage driver, what storage drivers are advised on certain OS and how to change it or looking for detailed info about setup of devicemapper, look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://knowledgepill.it/posts/docker_storage_drivers/">Docker storage driver - guide </a><br>
<a href="https://knowledgepill.it/posts/docker_configure_devicemapper/">Docker devicemapper - setup</a></p>
<hr>
<h5 id="important">Important</h5>
<p>If you plan to use Docker Enterprise with multiple nodes or Swarm - remember to set up time synchro between nodes - use NTP for that.</p>
<hr>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that <code>centos-extras</code> repo is enabled</li>
<li>Install <code>yum-utils</code>:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add repo</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum-config-manager <span>\
</span><span></span>  --add-repo <span>\
</span><span></span>  https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Install docker engine(Valid GPG Key: <code>060A 61C5 1B55 8A7F 742B 77AA C52F EB6B 621E 9F35</code>)</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
</code></pre></div><p>CentOS 8 at day of writing this post has problem with dependiences for containerd.io - you can solve this by installing manually correct version of containerd.io before running <code>docker-ce</code> instalation command. Example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum install https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/containerd.io-1.2.6-3.3.el7.x86_64.rpm
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Start and enable autostart of daemon:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
</code></pre></div><p>Optionally you can list available versions of docker and install preferable one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"> yum install docker-ce-&lt;VERSION_STRING&gt; docker-ce-cli-&lt;VERSION_STRING&gt; containerd.io
</code></pre></div><hr>
<p>For installing Docker Enterprise Edition you have to set up repo on your OS after getting from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/my-content">Docker Hub Account</a> Docker EE Repo Adress.</p>
<hr>

<ul>
<li>Update system and install important packages</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">apt-get update

<p>If you want that running containers won’t stop with docker daemon you can enable live restore feature. After enabling it you can perform upgrade of docker engine without stopping running containers.</p>
<p>In <code>/etc/docker/daemon.json</code> set:</p>
<p>Upgrade on CentOS or Ubuntu - if we install docker engine from repo - can be performed with simple <code>yum upgrade</code> or <code>apt-get upgrade</code> commands.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>GraphQL is a new approach</strong> for building an API that aims to get the better of two basic <strong>RESTful APIs limitations</strong> which are data filters &amp; relationships. These two classic REST flaws force REST users to always get the full payload in response &amp; hit multiple data sources separately.</p>
<h2>What is GraphQL</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language</strong> for APIs created and open-source by Facebook to solve the problem of unoptimized data flow in their mobile app. In general, GraphQL is a syntax that describing the way of requesting data from the server. The main difference comparing Graph QL to traditional REST API is that the response format is described in the query and defined by the client rather than the server. Another important thing about GraphQL is that it is language agnostic.</p>
<h2>Basic structure</h2>
<p>The core notion of using GraphQL is a <em>schema</em>.  Designing a schema is one of the first steps in the development process, casting a shadow over the rest of the project. A carefully planned Graph QL schema is the core of a well-designed and secure product. GraphQL Schema is a center-piece of any Graph QL project and it strictly defines its structure &amp; regulates how the data can be accessed.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Queries &amp; Mutations</h5>
<p>There are two basic types of GrahQL operations which are GraphQL Queries &amp; GraphQL Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GraphQL Queries</em> - query allows you to read or fetch data from the server-side,</li>
<li><em>GraphQL Mutations</em> - mutations are used to write or post values.</li>
</ul>

    </span></p>
<p>The performed operations have a form of a string that a GraphQL server can parse and respond to with requested data in a specific format i.e JSON.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Resolvers</h5>
<p>In order to understand what we are querying for the GraphQL server needs to have a defined set of functions/rules that our server would use to generate the response. These functions are called GraphQL Resolvers and they are responsible for handling our queries.</p>

<h2>GraphQL vs REST</h2>
<p>Imagine we want to retrieve posts from a company blog using RESTful API. First, we need to <code>GET api/posts</code>, but posts have other data like authors so we need to call REST API again to get the details of the posts i.e. authors ending up with two server requests instead of one, and as you continue to scale, you may have even more requests to different endpoints in order to fetch all the needed data. </p>
<p>The performance drop, especially on slow cellular connections,  was the main problem Facebook engineers observed, and the urge to find its solution was a substructure for GraphQL. In GraphQL API we have a single endpoint being able to process complex requests. You query the GraphQL server for specific data and it will respond with what was requested, which results in fewer bits transferred over the wire.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>React as a framework</h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now and its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones and I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance, and also most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2>1. Using useState when no rerender is needed</h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through the state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in the state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components, which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> c <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickCount<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Counter</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickRequest<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Submit</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At the first sight, you might ask what is exactly the problem with that? Isn't what what the state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will be never a problem with that, however in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children, but in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> count <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    count<span>.</span>current<span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>.</span>current<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickCount<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Counter</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickRequest<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Submit</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</div><div>
<h2>2. Using router.push instead of a link</h2>
<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should as far as possible be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2>3. Handling actions via useEffect</h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> fetchData <span>=</span> <span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setData</span><span>(</span>res<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>fetchData<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>loading <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>error <span>&amp;&amp;</span> data<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span>      <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> error<span>,</span> data<span>,</span> onSuccess<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Data: </span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Make sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. Also there is no 100% guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> fetchData <span>=</span> <span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>onSuccess<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>fetchData<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at the first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2>4. Single responsibility components</h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even hard to test or to reuse the component at other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>5. Single responsibility useEffects</h2>
<p>Remember the times, where we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p></div></div>

      I strongly recommend general programming knowledge. This course is a good starting <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">point</a> for complete beginners to programming and there are a ton more online.<br>
      If you know C/C++ and/or Assembly-bonus points. You will like reverse
      engineering and binary exploitation.<br>
      If you know JavaScript, PHP, and/or SQL, you will enjoy web security.<br>
      I chose tutorials that were hands-on and engaging so readers don't lose interest.
      CTF stands for Capture the Flag, which are hacking contests that happen online every weekend: <a href="https://ctftime.org/">CTFtime</a><br>
      A rule of thumb is to try each problem for 20 minutes to the best of your ability-use google, look at man pages and online documentation
      THEN ask for help.<br> Most websites like HacktheBox, TryHackMe, picoCTF, and others have Discords that are full
      of professionals.<br>
      Another site you may want to checkout is<a href="https://secure.meetup.com/login/"> meetup.com</a>, to meet other hackers and coders who can mentor you, or your local 2600 hacker group(i.e. <a href="https://www.phx2600.org/">Phoenix</a>).

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

    <div>
        <article>
            <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

          <p>My
<a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/improving-risc-v-linux-support-in-rust/">previous blog post</a>
introduced my work to improve <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust's</a> support for
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> Linux systems. Since then I fixed a couple of
interesting compiler bugs. This blog post is more technical - describing these
bugs and explaining some <code>rustc</code> internals along the way. I conclude by
reporting on movement in the broader Rust community regarding RISC-V. I
assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/late.rs#L1287"><code>src/librustc_resolve/late.rs</code></a>:</p>

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_span/symbol.rs#L1041"><code>Symbol</code></a>
is the type representing an interned string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, ParitialOrd, Hash)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>SymbolIndex</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which
provides the <code>Ord</code>ering of <code>Vec::sort</code> above) derives from the index's <code>Ord</code>ering.
But where does the index come from?</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p>This is the final article from the series about porting Unity SteamVR games to Oculus Quest.
The previous articles in the series:

<h2>Automated artifact building</h2>
<p>You may know that itâ€™s possible to automate artifact building in Unity. And of course, itâ€™s possible to automate artifact building for Windows and Oculus Quest while having the same code for both platforms. We added a batch file build.bat that is used by both developers and the build-server. This script is configured with several options and will execute platform-specific code to prepare and build the project in Unityâ€™s batch mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1593497398642-1.png" alt=""></p><p>build.bat:
</p>
<p>BuildScript.cs:
</p>
<p>Here you can see an example with light that is baked pre-build. We use Progressive GPU Lightmapper to achieve this, and you can find the OpenCL platform and device values in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GPUProgressiveLightmapper.html">documentation</a>. We take care of the baked light before building because we use procedural generation to slightly tweak scenes. You can remove these options if you donâ€™t use baked lighting or if its parameters are platform-independent.</p>
<p>One of the most annoying things related to building both for Windows and Oculus Quest is that you have to compress textures by using ASTC for Oculus Quest. That means textures are extracted and compressed each time you switch between two platforms while building artifacts. Switching from Windows to Oculus Quest might take 2 to 5 hours depending on the number of textures. We found that the most effective way is to clone the project repo in 2 separate directories for each platform and then build them independently. Obviously, we still retain the same codebase. We replicated this approach on our build-server (Jenkins) by creating 2 different projects with separate workspaces for each platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With this article we finish our series about porting SteamVR games to Oculus Quest. Our goal was to explain our approach to having shared code and resources for both platforms to reduce development and maintenance costs. This approach is certainly not universal, but it worked for our project and might work for yours. We hope that the articles answered most of the questions you might have during the porting process and saved some of your time.</p>

<p>AI having an expanding onto many places such as astronomically, e-commercially, economically, and many on other platforms.</p>
<p>Astronomically, the human’s having the suffer of the moon and more planet and researching about them and improving the ability of own to resolve those issue to the moon. Therefore, we can get useful information about it.</p>
<p>NASA has been a major place for astronomically to getting information about the planet, moon, sun, earth, etc.</p>
<p>NASA’s founded many of the planet and satellite in space. They have provided information about them among us. So, They’re been very helpful to us.</p>
<p>By Artificial Intelligence, the E-commercial system like the <a href="https://shiv1367.com/transmission-control-protocol-tcp"><span>internet</span></a> is connected to all e-commercial things globally. So, people are making easy to sell out any product on the internet.</p>
<p>The Internet is having more popular today by <strong>Artificial Intelligence AI</strong>. So, many sellers and buyers communicating by supporting the e-commerce <a href="https://shiv1367.com/what-is-wordpress"><span>web site</span></a> or <a href="https://shiv1367.com/mobile-application-mobile-app"><span>mobile application</span></a> such as social media platforms.</p>
<p>Today, billions of people’s using Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc. So, people do not effort more for selling and buying any product.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are having to create own web site to sell the product on the internet.</p>
<p>And having encourage to sell out the product to people by using many marketing strategies like <a href="https://shiv1367.com/email-electronic-mail"><span>E-mail</span></a> marketing, Digital marketing, Content marketing, etc.</p>
<p>Economically the human is also making easy all things by The <strong>Artificial Intelligence Applications</strong>. Because many of thing is connected by the smart system such as ATM (Automatic Transaction Through Machine) is making possible the transaction between user and system.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI2.jpg" alt="ATM (Automatic Transaction Machine)" width="691" height="518" data-src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI2.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><span><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></span><strong>AUTOMATIC TRANSACTION MACHINE</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Netbanking is also so much helpful to people for the online transaction. Therefore, People can use the money to purchase any product on the internet.</p>
<p>AI’s given us lots of smart electric things like solar is making possible to convert the sunlight to electric current through the human’s generating more electric current from the sun. By this proceeding, the people have not felt like darkness.</p>
<h2><span id="Advantages_Of_Artificial_Intelligence"><strong>Advantages Of Artificial Intelligence</strong></span></h2>
<p>By Artificial Intelligence The human work-load decreasing. So the time has been consuming.</p>
<p>People’s having more attractive to new things. So Human is getting much effort behind AI.</p>
<p>It’s more helpful to the patient. Because today have more smart AI machine available for diseased people such as ct scanner, x-ray scanner, etc.</p>

<p>AI’s improving human life to live as easy and changing the environment of the world as beautiful.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is making possible to build new things between us and improving the right to that’s a particular thing.</p>
<p>That’s been also useful in the field up meal or food and procedure of it to happen.</p>
<h3><span id="Negative_Effects_Of_Artificial_Intelligence">Negative Effects Of Artificial Intelligence</span></h3>
<p>Artificial Intelligence may have very dangerous for humans whether the error has been taken it’s maybe exploded.</p>
<p>That’s much harmful to a small or big animal as well as small aunts, dogs, cats, etc.</p>
<p>It’s increasing pollution. So the environment is being harmful to people’s be enough breath.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg" alt="Disadvantages Of AI" width="735" height="385" srcset="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg 300w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-768x402.jpg 768w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-390x205.jpg 390w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" data-srcset="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg 300w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-768x402.jpg 768w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-390x205.jpg 390w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4.jpg 1200w" data-src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div>
<p>Sometimes a big machine is more harmful. Because of the exploding of the machine may be very large by many large electrical resources.</p>
<p>It generates much risk to trees. Because poison of atmosphere It’s strict onto the fruit of trees. So human’s having got much trouble to health by that’s un-necessary objectives.</p>
<p>The human’s getting weak by AI. Because of more work done by AI machines.</p>

<p><strong>AI</strong> is important to make easy to all necessary things of humans. So, people having more attractive to the machine is making possible to all the human possibility. see more about the <a href="https://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C15/E6-44.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">best definition of artificial intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>Human is putting the whole effort and thought to a machine and encouraging to the machine to make it possible according to own.</p>
<p>Human’s trying the problem to resolved and forwarding the other issue to face out. Therefore they can reach till the goal.</p>
<p>The Intelligence of humans has been important many times by large attempted to solve those issues, Thus the human is having to be more sensible.</p>
<h3><span id="AI_In_Computer_Science"><strong>AI In Computer Science</strong></span></h3>
<p>John McCarthy says AI is the science engineering to making intelligent machines or intelligent&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shiv1367.com/whatisprogramming" target="_blank"><span>computer programs</span></a>. It is useful for developing a computer, computer-controller, or software.</p>
<p>AI is won by the study of How Human Mind Think, How Human Learning, How Human Make Decision. Then, using study the system or&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shiv1367.com/whatisprogramming" target="_blank"><span>software</span></a>&nbsp;is starting to development of it.</p>
<h3><span id="Contribution_To_AI"><strong>Contribution To AI</strong></span></h3>
<p>The intelligence of AI is based on science and technology to Computer Science, Biological, Psychological, Mathematical, etc. The important role of AI is the development of computer functions like reasoning, learning and solving the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence Programming With</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;1) It can answer specific questions to solve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) There is a need to put highly independent resources of information to collect. Therefore, You can modify the program information to the structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3) Modification can be easily and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence Programming Without</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;1) It can answer to generic the question to solve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) The structure can be changed to program leads by modification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3) Modification is not quick and easy.</p>
<h3><span id="Application_Of_AI"><strong>Application Of AI</strong></span></h3>
<p>There are been various ways for Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p><strong>1) Gaming</strong></p>
<p>AI is getting more benefits in such kinds of games like chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, and many others. where The AI machine can make a large number of possibilities by heuristic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>2) Natural Language Processing</strong></p>
<p>This is the best part of AI to understand the human’s speak language. It’s much tough to develop in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shiv1367.com/whatisprogramming" target="_blank"><span>programming</span></a>. But, Today it is possible by human intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>3) Expert Systems</strong></p>
<p>It is good for AI to learn about the system to others. This technique is to advise the user.</p>
<p><strong>4) Vision System</strong></p>
<p>It understands the module like interpretation, comprehends visual user input on the computer or any other device. The vision system is helpful for many ways like spying, finding diagnose for a patient.</p>
<p>It’s very helpful for the police to find the location of criminals and face also.</p>
<p><strong>5) Speech Recognition</strong></p>
<p>The AI system is capable of hearing the human’s voice or language in the term of sentences and meaningful talks to it.</p>
<p>That can measure in different ways like noise in the background, human noise to cold, slang words, etc.</p>
<p><strong>6) Handwriting Recognition</strong></p>
<p>The AI software for handwriting recognization to read and write the different text on paper by a pen or screen. It can find the letter, word, and character.</p>
<p><strong>7) Robots Intelligent</strong></p>
<p>Robots are plays various role by the Artificial Intelligence system. They can detect physical data from real data like lighting, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure.</p>
<p>It has many resources like sensors, effective processer, large storage.</p>
<h4><span id="History_Of_AI"><strong>History Of AI</strong></span></h4>
<p>You can see here about the history of AI from 1923 to 2000 years.</p>
<p><strong>In 1923</strong>, Karel Capek’s named “Rossum’s Universal Robots” (RUR) opened in London, 1923, the first use of the word “robot” in English.</p>
<p><strong>In 1943</strong>, development of neural networks organization.</p>
<p><strong>In 1945</strong>, Isaac Asimov, a Columbia University alumni, coined the term Robotics.</p>
<p><strong>In 1950</strong>, Alan Turing has given an introduction about TuringTest for the evaluation of artificial intelligence and published Computing Machinery. Claude Shannon.</p>
<p>He’s also published a detailed analysis of chess playing as a search.</p>
<p><strong>In 1956</strong>, John McCarthy leads the work of Artificial Intelligence. The first running of the AI program at Carnegie Mellon University in the year of 1958.</p>
<p>John McCarthy explores LISP programming language for Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>In 1964</strong>, Danny Bobrow has a dissertation at MIT to declared that computers can think of natural language well and enough to solve algebra word problems correctly.</p>
<p><strong>In 1965</strong>, Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in 1964 to built ELIZA, an interactive issue that carries on a dialogue in English.</p>
<p><strong>In 1969</strong>, Scientists at Stanford Research Institute built shakey, a robot, equipped with locomotion, perception, and problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>In 1973</strong>, The Assembly robotics group at Edinburgh University develop Freddy, the famous Scottish robot, capable of using vision to locate and assemble models.</p>
<p><strong>In 1979</strong>, The first computer-controlled autonomous vehicle, Stanford cart, was built.</p>
<p><strong>In 1985</strong>, Harold Cohen created and demonstrated the drawing program, Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>In 1990</strong>, Important serve in all areas of AI:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant demonstrations in ML, Case-based reasoning, Multi-agent planning, Scheduling, Data mining, Web Crawler, natural language understanding and translation, Vision, Virtual Reality, Games, etc.</p>
<p><strong>In 1997</strong>, The Deep Blue Chess Program beats the then world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.</p>
<p><strong>In 2000</strong>, Interactive robot pets become commercially available.</p>
<h4><span id="Important_AI_Analytics_ways"><strong>Important AI Analytics ways</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong>&nbsp;– Philosophy is like a logistics approach and reason to analyze the ways like How Human Knows.</p>
<p>That learns critical thinking, close reading, clear writing, and logical analysis. That helps to understand the language we use to describe the world and our place within it.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;– It is the science of all Like How Human Think As Long, How Human Do Work As Far. We can say That is the process of counting, …</p></div></div>

<h3><span>What is DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is a search engine similar to Google but, with a major difference – It does not track you! In the modern era of internet where the knowledge acquired by the entire humankind is available at your fingertips, the rise of corporate and government-funded digital-tracking has become a major threat to people’s privacy.</p>
<p>Almost all major search engines including Google, Bing and Yahoo track&nbsp; you. Google most of all!</p>



<h3><span>Why and how much do they track?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The reason to why they track is simple – Money! Most companies that provide their product without a cost to thier users earn on the data they collected about them. The data collected about your search history, websites visited, time spent on a website, etc. is used to profile you and categorize your interests and then sold to advertisement companies to make the profit. This is the same business model that social media companies like facebook, twitter, etc. use to make money off of your data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>In a world with companies offering free services, the consumer becomes their product!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google not only logs your search history from its search engine but also tracks your activities on various websites you visit by paying them to run their scripts on the site’s webpages.</p>



<h3><span>Don’t believe it?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>I know it might sound like a conspiracy theory but you’d be amazed to know how easy it is to verify these claims. Simply install a plugin like uBlock Origin (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin">For Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en-US">For Chrome</a>) that lets you see the domains that a website is trying to connect to from your computer and you’ll find that Google’s and Facebook’s trackers are all over the internet.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, the website’s content is downloaded to your device including HTML page, CSS styling and Java Scripts.

<p>The screenshot above is marked with a box that displays that when I visit Standard Chartered’s website, a total of 5 domains get information about my presence on that website. Of these 5 domains, the requests to sc.com and www.sc.com were partially blocked (Red Arrow marked 1), gioip-js.com and googletagmanager.com were completely blocked (Red Arrow Marked 2) and maps.googleapis.com were not at all blocked (Red Arrow Marked 3) by uBlock Origin’s default set of filters. If you’d look a little to the right of that red box, you’d notice that despite 7 requests being blocked in total (13% of all requests on that page), the website was still completely functional and that it did not break.</p>



<h3><span>What’s in it for the government?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Frankly, to answer this question is difficult. Sometimes, governments ask these companies to share the data to track their citizens for various reasons. Other times, the governments ask companies like Google to help identify the protestors by disclosing their mobile phone’s GPS location at the time of protests and as a <em>quid pro quo </em>they kill their competition by passing Laws to ban sites like DuckDuckGo. We can never know these answers for sure as these deals are made behind closed doors.</p>



<h3><span>So, what do I do about DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Well, fortunately the solution to this problem is extremely simple. You can go to the Menu section of Firefox, select Options, go to the “General” settings tab, scroll all the way to the bottom and click the “Settings” button under “Network Settings”.</p>

<p>Besides the two options provided by Firefox, you can also find a list of other HTTPS-enabled privacy-oriented DNS services on <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/">PrivacyTools.io – DNS</a> page.</p>



<h3><span>How Does This Solution Work?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>To understand how this solution work, we first need to understand how does the DNS work and <a href="https://crackerscreed.org/understanding-ssl-certificates/">how does SSL certificate work</a>. Once you understand that, you’d notice the if your DNS queries are sent over HTTPS, they can only be read by the DNS server and not by your ISP’s firewall. Without reading the your DNS query, they cannot tamper or block its intended response and hence cannot block you from getting its IP address.</p>



<h3><span>Is It A Fool-Proof Solution?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The unfortunate answer is No! There are other ways that a government can block a website like IP address based filtering, content based filtering, etc. And even if you bypass these filters and access DuckDuckGo, by no mean you become anonymous over the internet but, switching to an actively-maintained open-sourced browser such as Firefox, installing malware/tracking blocker plugin like uBlock Origin and switching to a privacy-oriented search engine can dramatically reduce your digital footprint. It could be your first step towards a long journey of internet anonymity and digital privacy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>apple doesn’t succeed at making their platforms accessible because they care more, they don’t succeed because they are somehow better at programming</h3>

<p>a capable, thoughtful manager, who is correctly assessing risk vs reward, both qualitatively and quantitatively, who is doing their job well, using all of the experience and skill that brought them to where they are, can, and likely will, decide to ship an app that could be accessible, but is not.</p>

<p>this is not a function of callousness (although they may also be quite callous).</p>

<p>this is not a function of engineering aptitude (plenty of our leading lights have let access fall to the wayside<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by making solid engineering choices that are completely defensible).</p>

<p>the apple accessibility teams are made up of disciplined, brilliant engineers. they all work incredibly hard on a problem with unimaginable scale. but their brilliance and discipline and hard work, while necessary, are not sufficient.</p>

<p>what matters here, what sets apple apart, is that they figured out how to go last and contain the risk enough to avoid a revolt from other teams or executive leadership. it costs them a lot to do so, has significant, measurable downsides, and requires a significant rethink of what it means to build good software.</p>

<h3>bundles</h3>

<p>some of the code that powers accessibility on apple platforms is just disgusting to look at and to work on.</p>

<p>most of the code that makes apple software accessible lives in what’s called an accessibility bundle. without diving into the minutia of the thing, bundles are a way to load something akin to a plugin into a cocoa app at runtime if an assistive technology is activated. it involves manipulating the app or framework class hierarchy and using objective-c dynamism to read app state and build up a usable accessibility hierarchy. insert a super class here, read an instance variable there, swizzle in a method and store the state for it in associated objects.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>bundles are not a good way to build software by any common measure. they don’t make you efficient, or your code correct. the performance can get bad. they’re hard to maintain and involve constant patching to keep them alive. huge chunks of bundle code are thrown away and rewritten multiple times during every major os release.</p>

<p>i found the initial adjustment to working on this code sometimes viscerally upsetting. “i can’t do that!!”, “clearly i should be protecting against…”, “if i do it that way it’ll break when they…”, etc.</p>

<p>the thing is, critically, if a user never activates an assistive technology like voiceover they wouldn’t know bundles even exist. many of the managers at apple don’t know much or care much about accessibility. some of them are borderline hostile to it. the bundles make it possible for the accessibility team to allocate their own resources and set their own priorities with only very limited coordination and fallout contained to people who would benefit most from the upside. they allow the accessibility team to fix the bugs they find, when they find them, with pretty limited opportunities for a manager who’s next promotion is on the line to get cold feet and pull resources or block fixes.</p>

<p>in the model of low end disruption, we can see bundles as a low end entrant, with a product that seems worse, but that solves an important problem in a way that the mature products, by their nature, can’t realistically address.</p>

<p>if the job to be done is “produce easy to understand, correct, maintainable code that engineers who care about those things will enjoy working on” then bundles aren’t even in the competition.</p>

<p>if the job is “manage your team resources responsibly, keep your bug count low, ship your features on time” then bundles aren’t the tool you reach for. why would you load a squirrelly plugin into your own app on purpose?</p>

<p>the chaotic morass of runtime hacks and macros for everything and nearly exclusive dependence on runtime validation<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> make them not just not good, but almost aggressively bad. but if the job they are hired to do is make apps that aren’t accessible, they’re incredible. unparalleled. entirely without peer.</p>

<p>almost all the things a good engineer would do to make bundles less gross would make them worse in unacceptable ways. almost anything a high end product might do to accommodate the kind of autonomy bundles demand would make them unacceptable to their current clients.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>apple has a team whose only job is to make things accessible and they have infrastructure that lets that team mostly avoid people who have a different job saying no to them. put those together and you have the most successful accessibility software team (imho) on planet earth.</p>

<h3>the gross stuff isn’t desirable, but is maybe necessary</h3>

<p>anyone who is steeped in universal design that has made it this far has maybe broken out in hives? please just stick with me, it’ll all come out in the wash.</p>

<ul>
<li>well designed apps that take accessibility into consideration from the beginning are better for everyone.</li>
<li>accessible ramps for getting into buildings are better than those terrible lifts they bolt into the sides of stairs in public buildings.</li>
<li>we all benefit from features in society that originate as accessibility affordances, like curb cuts for wheelchairs, that everyone with a stroller can now take for granted.</li>
</ul>


<p>without question these statements are true.</p>

<p>i don’t worry too much about saying things that might make people think i’m a bad engineer or have bad ideas about building software. i do care a lot about not giving people the idea that we should all knock out our accessibility code real quick and sloppy at the end as an afterthought.</p>

<p>my thesis here is that where the effect of failing is very much acute, most of us do not adjust our approach accordingly. likely because we regard assistive technology users as one of many available audiences we may or may not wish to court.</p>

<p>if we ship an app that’s inaccessible, hey we’ll get around to it, we’ve got a roadmap, hasn’t bubbled up yet, software takes time. there are so many bugs in our support tracker and “doesn’t work for blind people” is just a tiny blip.</p>

<p>of course we should be methodical and plan ahead and build our software in a way that is both accessible and maintainable. we should seek to avoid compromising, but should the need to compromise emerge, the balance should unquestionably be tilted towards gross and unmaintainable code where that is the cost of accessibility. if you could fix that missing label but eww i’d have to wire up a very clumsy chain of delegates or fire a notification that clearly violates layering, without question, you should do it.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>we should be willing to find a blend of cultural and political and technical workarounds in our organizations that acknowledge that code can’t be allowed to go out the door that isn’t accessible and that a lot of our ideas about technical excellence and what a good engineering manager does wildly miscalculate the cost of our decisions to “do it right”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>Most of the time, I want to do some throw away networking temporally to play
with something or to try something out. I really don't like changing all the
config on a machine just to try something. The FreeBSD documentation leans the
other way first showing you what to edit in rc.conf before maybe mentioning
that actual commands to run. </p>
<p>The ipfw documentation has a different problem. The example in the handbook and
online are both very verbose and very complicated. Because ipfw is normally
configured with a shell script the authors go absolutely wild with all the
features they can.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out ipfw in-kernel NAT from these guides. Instead
here I present the simplest set of commands I could find to set up a NAT and a
little explanation to help you debug when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is based on a great email from <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html">Allan Jude</a> on the
freebsd-virtualization list from 2014 that laid out the basics of this setup. </p>
<h2 id="set-up-overview">Set up Overview</h2>
<p>For testing I want to run virtual machines and vnet jails on my laptop and give
them have access to the internet. I want a throw away NAT setup that is ready
to go quickly.</p>
<p>My laptop connects to my home network (and eventually the internet) over wifi.
The wifi network offers me an address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. On my
laptop I want to have multiple guests. To do this we are going to use ipfw NAT
and a bridge interface. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>         TO INTERNET
          ^
          |
          |
          v
          +-------+  192.168.1.x
+-------------| wlan0 |---------------+
|             +-------+               |
|                 ^                   |
|                 |                   |
|              ipfw nat               |
|                 |                   |
|                 V                   |
|            +---------+              |
| 10.0.4.1   | bridge0 |              |
|            +----+----+              |
|                 ^                   |
|                 | 10.0.4.0/24       |
|      ___________+_______________    |
|      |       |        |        |    |
|      v       v        v        v    |
|  +---+--+ +--+---+ +--+---+ +--+---+|
|  | jail | |  vm  | | jail | | ...  ||
|  +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+|
+-------------- laptop ---------------+
</code></pre><p>The interfaces in the jails (the b half of the epair) and the virtual machines
(the vtnet in the V) won't be visible to ipfw, but will exist in their own
world. To work around this we will use a bridge with the epairs and tap
interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ipfw-nat">Setting up ipfw NAT</h2>
<p>We need to load the kernel modules for ipfw and the ipfw in kernel NAT. ipfw
has the frustrating default (and annoyingly different to ipf and pf) of to
dening all traffic. This default has the great property of locking you out of a
machine you are setting up remotely.</p>
<p>This is control by a sysctl that cannot be changed at run time, but we can
change the default behaviour with kenv before we load the module:</p>
<pre><code># kenv net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
</code></pre><p>Now we can safely load ipfw and the in-kernel NAT. </p>
<pre><code># kldload ipfw ipfw_nat
</code></pre><p>ipfw should load enabled, if you are having trouble later on double check that
the firewall is actually enabled.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.fw.enable
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
</code></pre><p>When we do NAT we are acting as a gateway between the traffic on the NATd
interface and the real interface. For any packets to be passed we need to
enable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
</code></pre><h2 id="ipfw-rule-set">ipfw rule set</h2>
<p>We need to create an IPFW NAT instance configured with the interface we want to
NAT (wlan0 in this case) and configure rules to pass all traffic from the
bridge through the NAT.</p>
<pre><code># ipfw nat 1 config if wlan0
# ipfw add 101 nat 1 ip from 10.0.4.0/24 to any out via wlan0
# ipfw add 103 nat 1 ip from any to any in via wlan0
</code></pre><p>I like to leave a gap between rules like this so I can insert an ipfw log
command for the eventual case that nothing makes sense and everything is
broken.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-interfaces">set up interfaces</h2>
<p>A bridge is the center of our guest network, we will give it the default root
address that all of our guests will speak to.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge create
bridge0
# ifconfig bridge0 inet 10.0.4.1/24 up
</code></pre><p>Our jail will use an epair interface to speak to the outside world. They come
as an a and a b part, ifconfig only tells us about the a part when it clones
the interface. When we give a vnet jail an interface it is no longer visible to
the host system. An epair gives us two interfaces that act like a virtual
ethernet cable, we stick one end into the jail and the other is connected to
the bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig epair create
epair0a
</code></pre><p>Our virtual machine will use a tap interface to access the world. The tap
interface needs to be brought up. There is a helpful sysctl that is off by
default which will trigger the interface to be brought up when it is first
opened. I like to set this to one, otherwise I find myself debugging networking
inside the VM alot with little success.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig tap create
tap0
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
</code></pre><p>With all the interfaces set up we need to add them to our bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge0 addm epair0a addm tap0
</code></pre><h2 id="create-jail">Create jail</h2>
<p>Never spoken about is the bsdinstall jail command. It takes a directory and
installs a jail into it. This command will ask you some questions, it would be
cool if it didn't, that would make automating jail creation in scripts much
easier for me.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir testjail
# bsdinstall jail testjail
</code></pre><p>We make our jail persist so it will stick around as we experiment. The
following command creates the jail on the host:</p>
<pre><code># jail -c name=testjail persist vnet path=testjail vnet.interface=epair0b 
</code></pre><p>Now we can jexec into the jail and configure the epair. When you bring one end
of an epair up, the other end comes up, when it goes down the other end goes
down. We just need to configure an address and a default route in our jail.</p>
<pre><code># jexec testjail sh
[testjail] # ifconfig epair0b inet 10.0.4.4/24 up
[testjail] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 192.168.1.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>With this setup the jail can speak to our bridge, the local network and the
wider Internet.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-config-a-vm">Create and config a VM</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD offers prebuilt virtual machine images, The latest current one is
available from a url like this:</p>
<pre><code># fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/VM-IMAGES/13.0-CURRENT/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
</code></pre><p>It would be cool if there was a latest symlink that gave you a new head VM from
one static place. The image comes xz compressed, we need to unpack it and I
like to move it to a consistent place:</p>
<pre><code># xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
# mv FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw /vms/freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>bhyve requires we load the vmm kernel module, with that we can use the
excellent vmrun.sh script to launch our vm.</p>
<pre><code># kldload vmm
# sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 4 -m 1024 -t tap0 -d /vms/freebsd-current freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>Once that comes up you can log in and do some manual config.</p>
<pre><code>[vm] # ifconfig vtnet0 inet 10.0.4.5/24 up
[vm] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[vm] # ping 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>For DNS in both the jail and the virtual machines I have to manually set up the
name server local from my network.</p>
<p>/etc/resolv.conf</p>
<pre><code>search lan
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre><p>This won't be valid as I move to other networks, but I am sure I will remember
after only a little confusion and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That is all it takes. The NAT configuration is 3 firewall rules and enabling
forwarding. None of this is persistent and that isn't great practice for a
production environment, but it you just want to experiment with ipfw and NAT,
or spin up a VM for today knowing how to do this in a non-persistent way is
really helpful.</p>

<p>Human beings are not very good at seeing into the future. Unless you have a crystal ball or know how to read tea leaves, trying to predict when an event will happen with any degree of accuracy is very difficult. Unfortunately, as software developers, we are regularly asked to do this. Stakeholders usually want to know when they can expect the completion of features. It can make them nervous if we tell them that we don’t know for sure, or give a timeframe that sounds worryingly large to them to account for our uncertainty.</p>

<p>Story points attempt to solve this by sidestepping time-based estimates, and focusing instead upon estimating complexity - on the basis that we are better at judging how complicated a piece of work is than how long it will take to complete.  Estimating complexity allows us to abstract away things that we can’t reasonably predict (and often throw off our predictions) such as illness and distractions, and focus on the things that we can - like whether one task is going to be bigger than another.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to quantify complexity, it is possible to begin to measure how much of it can be tackled over time - this is known as velocity. Measuring a team’s velocity allows us to build forecasts of how much work they are likely to be able to complete in the future. Note the word <em>likely</em> in that last sentence. Story points are not a silver bullet that will let you make perfect predictions about when a task will be finished - but in my experience, they are a significant step up from trying to estimate time directly.</p>

<p>They help you shift from hand-waving and guessing, to evidence-based reasoning about a teams capacity. Over time I’ve found that the accuracy of story point-based predictions tend to improve as teams gain practice and experience, and as the error in velocity averages away as more data gets added to the calculation.</p>

<p>Story points can be a contentious topic amongst software professionals; a lot have had bad experiences with them, and don’t see how they can ever help on a project. While I don’t think story points will be a good fit for <em>all</em> projects, I do believe that they can be useful on <em>a lot</em> of projects - especially when teams are inexperienced and haven’t had a chance to build up some discipline.</p>

<p>I regularly hear two objections to story points that, in my opinion, betray underlying flaws in peoples thinking rather than a problem with the technique itself:</p>

<p>Firstly: that the complexity of a task is different depending on whether you have more or less experience, often stated as ‘my points are different from your points’. Secondly: that there is ultimately no real difference between complexity and time - ‘five points is about a day, this task will take about a day, so I vote five points’.</p>

<p>The first objection is problematic because you should be estimating for the team, not individuals. If a task is going to be harder for a particular person to complete, then the team should be working with them to help. If you expect someone to struggle to complete work by themselves with no assistance when it would benefit them, then you have more significant problems on your team than estimation. It would be best if you focused on fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing before worrying about anything else.</p>

<p>The second objection is harder to help people move past.  The cognitive leap from time-based estimation, to complexity-based estimation, is quite a large one. The easiest way that I have found to help people get into the right frame of mind is by agreeing on a story to use as a reference at the beginning of estimation sessions. The question then becomes ‘how much larger is the story we are currently estimating than our reference story?’ When they don’t have a lot of experience with relative complexity, people often find ranking stories, and then fitting points to them later much more straightforward than coming up with points on the spot (as you would with planning poker).</p>

<p>With a bit of time and practice, most teams can build up an implicit understanding of how story points relate to the complexity of individual pieces of work in their backlog.  As a team becomes more practised, a satisfying moment eventually occurs: everyone’s estimates begin to converge. You know that your team is getting the hang of things when everyone is consistently voting for the same number of story points on each piece of work that comes up; and when any significant variation that occurs is the result of someone knowing something that the others haven’t considered.</p>

<p>Whether or not you use story points on your project, I think there are some ideas we can learn from them that are universally applicable. Almost all projects benefit when we can quantify changes to them over time. Reflecting upon, and learning from our experiences is a crucial part of agile development, and doing this with data can give us confidence in our conclusions, and justification for our predictions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="794f">As software developers, we are a fairly unique group. For many of us, our profession is also our hobby. On the surface this is great:</p><blockquote><p id="4d9e">“Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”</p><p id="8b67">― Mark Twain</p></blockquote><p id="e093">However, in reality, the inspiration for new ideas usually comes up as a side-effect of the things you do in your spare time. Needless to say, that when you program in your spare time as well as your day job, most of your ideas are about “products” aimed at other software developers.</p><p id="1a04">This gave birth to many amazing open-source projects, commercial products, as well as small and large companies built around those products.</p><p id="ff7f">Over my own career I’ve made quite a few products like that: in 2002-2003 I’ve created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070430180014/http://www.spaweditor.com/en/disp.php/en_products/en_spaw/en_spaw_intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPAW Editor</a> so developers can add a WYSIWYG editor to their web apps, in 2011 I started <a href="https://adduplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdDuplex</a> so developers can cross-promote their Windows apps, and in 2018 I made <a href="https://markerjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marker.js</a> so developers can implement image annotation. And there were a lot of similar products and projects in-between.</p><p id="cd00">As time passed, though, from-developers-for-developers space got very well saturated. For every noun you can think of there’s a JavasScript library with that name. For every task you want to automate in your development process someone already made a tool. You are often lead (by your own [lack of] imagination) to creating an alternative for something that already exists with only marginal improvement in performance or a slightly nicer API.</p><p id="c2e9">This may be fine for those 10x-alpha-developers, as by iterating on those marginal improvements they move our industry forward. But for us mere mortal developers with impostor syndromes based in reality, the hobbyist part of our dev life got much harder. At least for me personally, coming up with useful ideas for the for-developers projects got infinitely more difficult.</p><h2 id="dceb">Enter out-of-left-field hobby</h2><p id="2b39">Earlier this year I took on an old-new hobby —learning and making music. (Check out my <a href="https://medium.com/renoob" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music-making blog here</a>).

July 1, 2020 | http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>

<p>I’m trying to read all the good writing about software design. This is very easy because not very much has been written: it turns out that it’s much easier to write an article about how to write a Tetris AI as a containerized Kotlin microservice than it is to shed insight on how to write good code. And so, when I heard about John Ousterhout’s new book “A Philosophy of Software Design,” I ordered my copy immediately.</p>

<center><img height="200" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iOSX4WNiL._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="161"></center>

<p>I remember John Ousterhout from Stanford’s grad student visit day as the tall guy who introduced himself with a self-deprecating joke and invited all the Ph. D. admits over to dinner at his house. I know him also as the father of <a href="http://kayousterhout.org/">Kay Ousterhout</a>, whom I recently met as a fellow speaker at Strange Loop, and Amy Ousterhout, whom together are the first pair of sisters to both win the prestigious Hertz Fellowship.</p>

<p>At 170 pages, “A Philosophy of Software Design” (henceforth: PoSD) is a humble book. John’s background is in systems rather than in software engineering or programming languages, and he never claims special expertise. But his practitioner cred is immense. I enjoy tearing apart open-source projects and turning them into case studies of what not to do, so much that my students have requested I write a case study about good code for once. RAMCloud, Ousterhout’s distributed in-memory storage system, is now on my shortlist: from a 5-minute glance, it’s among the cleanest and best-documented code I’ve seen. And, given that he’s a busy professor managing a large lab, he’s written a surprising amount of it himself. He’s had plenty of impact too: he’s the creator of the Tcl language and its Tk framework, which I learned in 2005 as The Way to Write GUIs(™).</p>

<p>PoSD is best read as a tactical guide of how-to’s. About a quarter of it is spent on naming and comments, and much of the rest is about specific patterns. His few attempts to jump from tactical advice to principles are either done by trying to blur together similar-sounding tips, or are hamstrung by his inability to see the meaning of a program beyond the code (more on that later). He demonstrates the lack of principles comically in Chapter 19, where he promises to apply the books’ “principles” to several software trends, and then fills the rest of the chapter with standard (but solid) advice on unit-testing and OOP, with nary a reference to the rest of the book. On the whole, the book’s advice is higher-level than beginner books like Clean Code, but most of its contents will be familiar to a senior software engineer, and the novel parts are hit-and-miss.</p>

<p>Following other books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do"><i>Code Simplicity</i></a>, PoSD starts with a high-minded explanation of the benefits of good code and the dangers of complexity. Its early chapters are a grand tour of the basic concepts of software organization: separating levels of abstraction, isolating complexity, and when to break up functions. Chapter 5 is one of the most approachable introductions I’ve seen to Parnas’s ideas about information hiding. But it’s Chapter 4 where he introduces the book’s central idea: deep modules. An interface, explains Ousterhout, is not just the function signatures written in the code. It also includes informal elements: high-level behavior, constraints on ordering; anything a developer needs to know to use it. Many modules are shallow: they take a lot to explain, but don’t actually do that much. A good module is deep: the interface should be much simpler than the implementation.</p>

<p>Beautiful, obvious, and impossible to disagree with. Unfortunately, it’s also objectively wrong.</p>

<h2>
When specifications are longer than the code</h2>

<p>It sounds pretty nice to say “interfaces should be shorter than the implementation?” How do you test it?</p>

<p>To Ousterhout, where the interface is just a comment and some discussion about whether it’s simple to use and think about. Intuition and experience are the sole arbiters here. And this reveals his major blind spot.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html">explained</a> <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html">before</a>&nbsp;that the important information of software design is not in the code (Level 2), but in the logic: the specifications and reasoning that are rarely written down concretely, but shape the code nonetheless. I group these artifacts into the aggregate “Level 3 constructs.” The “informal interface” Ousterhout describes is such a Level 3 construct, but they’re just as real as the code, and, contrary to Ousterhout, there are plenty of programming languages that do let you write them down and check them.</p>

<p>Experience doing this gives us concrete grounding when we talk software design. It’s how we move into <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/">post-rigorous</a> stage of software engineering, and know what we mean when we use terms like “interface” and “complexity.” It defends us against making confused and contradictory statements. Ousterhout lacks this insight, and that’s how he gets burned.</p>

<p>I’m going to pause for a moment and tell you: I like this book overall. It's well-written, and there’s a lot of advice in the book that I consider useful even though it’s on shaky ground, and more that doesn’t depend on this at all. Still, Ousterhout makes a big deal out of it, and so I’ll be taking a couple pages to explain why it’s wrong. These ideas are important, because they’re part of what leads to the higher levels of mastery.</p>

<p>My view is that Ousterhout’s “informal interface” is just the translation into English of a formal specification. Any question we have about interfaces can be answered by asking the question “what would a specification look like?” While I can’t prove the correspondence without peaking into Ousterhout’s head more than I’ve gotten to in our back-and-forth, I’ve found this lens unreasonably effective in helping to explain software design. And so, for the remainder of this post, I’ll be using the words “spec” and “interface” interchangeably.</p>

<p>I agree that the spec should usually be much simpler than the code. But anyone with experience actually formalizing specs can tell you that there are interesting cases where the specification is and should be more complicated than the implementation.</p>

<p>That's right: there are times when it’s actually desirable to have a specification more complicated than the code. Two major reasons are <b>ghost state </b>and <b>imprecision</b>. Ghost state is a concept from verification that describes certain kinds of “subtle” code. It’s an interesting subject that deserves its own blog post; I won’t mention it again. (Short version: it’s when a simple action like flipping a bit actually represents something conceptually complicated.)</p>

<p>Imprecision is a bigger one. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specification: The temperature of the Fudarkameter will be between 60 and 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Implementation: The temperature of the Fudarkameter is 70 degrees.</li>
</ul><p>
The specification is longer precisely because it creates an abstraction barrier. If you design the rest of the system assuming the Fudarkameter is exactly 70 degrees, then the Fudarkameter becomes much harder to change or replace. By weakening the assumptions placed on a module, code becomes more evolvable.</p>

<p>On top of these, there’s another fundamental reason: It is much easier to describe something from the inside than from the outside. It is much easier to show you an apple than to answer every question you may ask of it. (Where are the seeds? How will it roll when I drop it?) And while there is more you can say <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/">about a single apple</a> than all the apples in the world, there are more things that may be true about some apple than about a single apple.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take a stack data structure, something I hope we can all agree is a useful abstraction. A stack is a sequence with push and pop operations, following the last-in-first-out ordering. The linked-list implementation is very short: just adding and removing elements off the front of the list. But if you use a stack, and you don’t want to use internal details of this implementation, then you need a way to think about it that doesn’t reference the underlying sequence. One solution is to use the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/204/ADTs/">stack axioms</a>, which say things like “If you push something onto a stack and then pop from the stack, you get the old value back” and “If you’ve ever pushed something onto a stack, then it’s not empty.” We’ve gone from the internal view of explaining how the stack operations manipulate memory, to the external view of explaining their interactions and observable behaviors.</p>

<p>In my public correspondence with Prof. Ousterhout, I illustrated this by writing down an implementation and interface for a stack data structure, including the stack axioms. My implementation was 30 tokens; the interface was 54.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can find a shorter way to explain stacks, but this is not looking good. It seems that Ousterhout’s advice, held under a microscope, is actually telling us we should not use stacks in our code (or, at least, only use the more complicated implementations, like lock-free concurrent stacks).</p>

<h3>
<b>A “Simple” API</b></h3>

<p>It’s easy for the interface for stacks to be larger than the implementation because they’re so small. Now, let’s look at something larger. I don’t need to look very hard for an example, because Ousterhout gives me one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mechanism for file IO provided by the Unix operating system and its descendants, such as Linux, is a beautiful example of a deep interface. There are only five basic system calls for I/O, with simple signatures: </p>

<pre><span>int</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>path,</span> <span>int</span> <span>flags,</span> <span>mode_t</span> <span>permissions);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>const</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd);</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>The POSIX file API is a great example, but not of a deep interface. Rather, it’s a great example of how code with a very complicated interface may look deceptively simple when reduced to C-style function signatures. It’s a stateful API with interesting orderings and interactions between calls. The flags and permissions parameters of <span>open</span> hide an enormous amount of complexity, with hidden requirements …</p></div></div></div>

        <section>
          <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>In this post, I want to describe the strategy I've used in the last
implementation of one of my side projects. The side project is not important at
all, it's mostly a TODO/GTD task manager, but I use it as a test bed for
anything I'm interested in learning or trying out. The source code is
<a href="https://github.com/msurdi/wipku">here</a> and it is deployed
<a href="https://wipku.herokuapp.com/">here</a> if you want to try this out.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I'm not a security expert, I'm just a web developer and probably not even a good
one, I want to describe this with the intention that somebody that understands more
about this could point out issues and help me make the approach more secure and
more easy to use.</p>
<h2>The problem with passwords</h2>
<p>Personally I don't like passwords, because a) I don't want to use the same
password everywhere, 2) Using different passwords everywhere is impossible
unless you 2a) use a password manager and/or 2b) use a
<a href="http://www.davidgumpper.com/security/developing-a-password-schema/">schema</a>
based on the website or something else that lets you generate the passwords
quickly and consistently for a any given website. And that's just what I don't
like as a user.</p>
<p>As a developer I don't like passwords because its very difficult and risky to
implement all the logic for generating them (salts, algorithms, lengths, etc),
storing them and implementing registration forms, login forms, password reset
forms, etc. So unless you use an existing solution from a CMS or big framework
(<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>,
<a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a>, etc.. ) where you have a "Golden Path" for this,
you're in a pretty bad situation.</p>
<h2>Existing solutions research</h2>
<p>I was looking for a passwordless way to authenticate users without depending on
any third party <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oauth</a> provider. While
researching about this, I've found that it seems the most common approach to
this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask the user for email address.</li>
<li>Generate from the server a link with a token and send it by email to the user.</li>
<li>When the user clicks on the link, sign the user in, either in the newly
opened tab/browser or in the original one, or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach is very simple, and I think there are many sites using it. The
first time I came across a login system like this was when I signed up to try
out Zeit's PaaS platform <a href="https://vercel.com/login?with-email=1">here</a>, now
called Vercel, hopefully will still have this name when you read this.</p>
<p>When I was investigating more about this approach, the first question to came to
my mind was wether I should log-in the user in the newly opened tab after the
user has clicked in the email link (thus what do I do in his previous tab?) or
wether again to follow Zeit's approach and in this new tab tell the user
"Awesome, you're now logged in, please close this tab and go back to the other
one". The first approach has an important drawback which is that the link might
have opened on a completely different browser, even on a completely different
device if the user clicked the link on his phone. The second approach I think is
even worse because anyone could go to the website, enter somebody else's email
and if that person happens to accidentally click this email then somebody
somewhere might get logged in as him.</p>
<p>There might be workarounds such as
comparing IP addresses, browser fingerprinting, etc, etc... but it gets risky
and complex in my opinion. Also, the user might not have even clicked in the
link but his antivirus might have made a request to the link, or anything in
between him and his email client. Not great.</p>
<h2>The salted passwordless approach</h2>
<p>So I kept investigating and trying out things and finally came to the following
process I want to describe here with the hope that somebody else will help me
understand more about its drawbacks and why it might not be a good idea, or if
seems to be a good one then help me to improve it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure if this already exists under some well known industry name
and I've just missed that out. Thus I'm basically reinventing the square wheel
here.</p>
<p>So, the process goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application prompts the user for an email address.</li>
<li>The application saves in the browser's localStorage (or just in memory) the
email address, and randomly generated salt.</li>
<li>The application contacts the backend, submitting the email address and the
generated salt.</li>
<li>The application shows the user a dialog of the kind "We've just sent you an
access code to your email, enter it below".</li>
<li>The server generates an access code and then saves in the database the tuple
consistig of (time, email, salt, code), this is the "authentication request".</li>
<li>The server sends an email to the user, containing just the code, which would
be something like "09124".</li>
<li>The user enters this code in the screen resulting from step 4.</li>
<li>The application submits to the server the tuple (code, email, salt).</li>
<li>If the code, the salt, the email and the expiration (time since request was
created) are valid, then create a session, otherwise fail the login.</li>
</ol>
<p>What problems does this process solve?</p>
<ol>
<li>No need for a password, which was the first requirement.</li>
<li>No need to implement password recovery processes, registration processes, etc.</li>
<li>No need to permanently store any sensitive information about the user. You
might not even need to store the email address (you could use a hash of it as
the user ID).</li>
<li>If the email with the access code is intercepted, there is no risk for the
user: whoever intercepted the email would also need access to the user's
browser localStorage (or memory) to get the salt, otherwise the server won't
validate that access code and thus wont create a session.</li>
<li>We don't have the problem of the user opening the "magic link" in a different
browser, given there is no magic link at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>What drawbacks does this process have?</p>
<ol>
<li>The user will not be able to log in if he is having any kind of problem with
his email, or his email provider is slow to delivery new messages, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>So far I'm pretty excited about this solution and that's probably bad for me,
because I might be missing something out, and that's the main motivation of
writing this down here. Unless there is some big security issue I'm not aware
of, I think the trade-off/drawbacks of the approach are quite acceptable for the
usability and implementation benefits.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>I’ve spent the last few months preparing for and applying for data science jobs. It’s possible the data science world may reject me and my lack of both experience and a credential above a bachelors degree, in which case I’ll do something else. Regardless of what lies in store for my future, I think I’ve gotten a good grasp of the mindset underlying machine learning and how it differs from traditional statistics, so I thought I’d write about it for those who have a similar background to me considering a similar move.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>This post is geared toward people who are excellent at statistics but don’t really “get” machine learning and want to understand the gist of it in about 15 minutes of reading. If you have a traditional academic stats backgrounds (be it econometrics, biostatistics, psychometrics, etc.), there are two good reasons to learn more about data science:</p>



<ul><li>First, data science jobs tend to pay more than other quantitative jobs. It’s a bit taboo to bring this up– after all, aren’t we all supposed to be doing this out of passion and love? I’m not going to pretend that making more money is a bad reason to pursue something, and I reserve no judgment for those whose primary motivation is to earn more.</li><li>Second, data scientists genuinely do some pretty interesting things and have a very interesting approach to working with data, even if my gut reaction is to barf when someone says “teaching the model” instead of “estimating the parameters.”</li></ul>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Q: What's the difference between statistics and machine learning?</p><p>A: About $50,000/year</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1131244580115046405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The world of data science is, in many ways, hiding in plain sight from the more academically-minded quantitative disciplines. I’m not going to spend much time covering the different algorithms that data scientists use: partly because a lot of the algorithms they use are the same as what statisticians use, but also because the algorithms aren’t the point of this post. In this post I’ll be writing a short guide on how to translate your statistics skills into data science very quickly.</p>



<p>After finishing this post, I recommend downloading (for free) and reading through <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> (herein TESL). It is an excellent and comprehensive textbook that covers all the major machine learning topics, and is geared toward people with a strong math background, especially linear algebra.</p>



<h2>Philosophical Differences Between Statistics and Machine Learning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The main difference between machine learning and statistics is what I’d call “β-hat versus y-hat.” (I’ve also heard it described as inference versus prediction.) Basically, academia cares a lot about what the estimated parameters look like (β-hat), and machine learning cares more about being able to estimate a dependent variable given some inputs (y-hat). There are handful of other differences, but they are rooted in this. Once you understand this, combined with your background in stats, you will basically understand machine learning.</p>



<h4> β-Hat Versus Y-Hat</h4>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My date: I am studying machine learning</p><p>Me [trying to impress her]: I too am studying how to do regressions in California</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1145076273410129921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Once you stop caring about your parameters, you can start making them look like nonsense, i.e. by adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">bias</a> (the parameter is wrong) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator">inconsistency</a> (the parameter doesn’t converge over infinite observations). In some cases, you can even turn the model into more or less a complete black box that just spits out a y-hat; this is what neural networks are, basically. Traditionally, it’s a cardinal sin in academia to use parameters like these because you can’t say anything interesting about the parameters, but the trick in machine learning is that you don’t need to say anything about the parameters. In machine learning, your focus is on describing y-hat, not β-hat.</p>



<p>Why so much love for y-hat? The friendly, less cynical answer is that within the last decade, everyone got their hands on a crap-ton of data and computational power, and they want to do cool and useful things with it. Machine learning is a pretty natural way to leverage all this data and power because machine learning has tools to deal with multicollinearity and to find really deep, hidden correlations and patterns in data. As you can imagine, machine learning doesn’t let you side-step the dirty work of specifying your data and models (a.k.a. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a>,” according to data scientists), but it makes it a lot easier to just run things without thinking too hard about how to set it up. In statistics, bad results can be wrong, and being right for bad reasons isn’t acceptable. In machine learning, bad results are wrong if they catastrophically fail to predict the future, and nobody cares much how your crystal ball works, they only care that it works.</p>



<figure><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fgilpress%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F03%2FTime-1200x511.jpg" alt="Time"><figcaption>For those of you who have never done anything outside a classroom setting, this is literally every data related task, whether you’re an accountant working in Excel or a PhD data scientist working for 6-figures.<br><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#9b3182c6f637">(Source: Forbes.)</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This newfound love for y-hat is a bit opportunistic, but in fairness, y-hat tends to be more important than β-hat for a wide array of business use cases. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Recommender systems (such as Youtube showing you more videos you might like, or showing  a customer items they might want to buy next).</li><li>Computer vision (such as optical character recognition or facial recognition).</li><li>Forecasting (such as estimating how much a customer will buy at a store, or how likely someone is to default on a loan).</li></ul>



<p>None of these tasks require having a human interpret the parameters and figure out what’s driving what to get a sufficiently acceptable answer; it’s all predictive.</p>



<h4>Letting Go of  β-Hat</h4>



<p>There are a lot of things that data scientists do that made literally zero sense to me before I grasped how to think in terms of y-hat.</p>



<p>The big one that made no sense to me the first time I encountered it back in 2017 is that data scientists split their data into <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/data-science-essentials-why-train-validation-test-data-b7f7d472dc1f">“training data,” “validation data,” and “testing data.”</a> The reason this does not make sense to β-hat-brained people is because adding more observations should get you closer to the true parameter because, you know, the law of large numbers. There are two issues with the old school thought process. The first is that there is no “true” parameter if your parameters are intentionally allowed to be a little biased. The second is that there is no guarantee of convergence to anything if your parameters are allowed to be asymptotically inconsistent.</p>



<p>I’m sure you’re asking: “why allow your parameters to be biased?” Good question. The most straightforward answer is that there is a bias-variance trade-off. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff">The Wikipedia article </a>does a good job both illustrating and explaining it. For β-hat purposes, the notion of allowing any bias is crazy. For y-hat purposes, adding a little bias in exchange for a huge reduction in variance can improve the predictive power of your model.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<h4>Adding Bias to OLS with Ridge Regression</h4>



<p>Ridge regression is the most straightforward example of adding bias. If you understand OLS, you’re like two paragraphs of reading away from understanding ridge regression.</p>



<p>Basically, instead of just solving for the β vector that minimizes the sum of squared residuals as one does with OLS, i.e. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ols%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+x_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2">, you can also add a “penalty” to large squared β’s while trying to find the β-hat that minimizes the objective function. So you add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"> to the objective function, where λ is some constant. Then, last but not least, you “standardize” each column <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="X_j" title="X_j">, which means transforming it to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_j+%5Csim+N%280%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="Z_j \sim N(0,1)" title="Z_j \sim N(0,1)"> by subtracting each column by the column’s mean and dividing by the column’s standard deviation: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%3D+%28x_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+-+%5Cmu_j%29+%2F+%5Csigma_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j" title="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j"> (the purpose of this is to make it so the parameters measure the <em>relative</em> impacts to the overall result, as opposed to the nominal impacts, otherwise the penalty wouldn’t work the way you’d probably want it to). This gives you the ridge regression estimator:</p>



<p> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%5Cbeta+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+z_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"></p>



<p>At λ=0, the summation of squared β’s you just tacked onto the objective function equals zero regardless of what the β-hat vector is, so you just have OLS again. As λ→∞, the penalties for all nonzero β’s become so huge that the only way for the penalties to not overwhelm the objective function is to have all the parameters β-hat = 0. And the closed-form solution to the objective function, it turns out, is pretty similar to OLS’s closed-form solution:   <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%28%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z-%5Clambda+%5Cmathbf+I%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y">.</p>



<p>All pretty straightforward, but the real question is why would you do this? Well, if you don’t care about the interpretability/bias of the parameters but you want the model to predict out-of-sample better than regular OLS, you can find some value of  λ through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)">cross-validation</a> that gives you a better fit than  λ=0, i.e. minimizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_prediction_error">prediction errors</a>. But in order to cross-validate the data, you need to split your data into data you use to estimate the parameters (training data) and data to perform the cross-validation on (validation data). This process is what sets your λ.</p>



<p>Ridge regression is OLS with L2 regularization, which is penalization by the square of the parameter. L1 regularization takes the absolute value of the parameters as the penalty instead of the square (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">lasso</a>). And of course, L1 and L2 regularization can be used in contexts other than linear regression, such as logistic regression. These regularization methods are especially good at dealing with multicollinearity, which is definitely something you’d come across with thousands of columns of corporate data and no compelling way to decide which are the best columns to use.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>I could go on, but regurgitating all of TESL isn’t why I wrote this blog. I like showing ridge regression as an example of machine learning because it’s very similar to OLS, but is totally and unabashedly modified for predictive purposes, instead of inferential purposes. β-hat is never the …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p><em>Note: this essay tries to answer the question “What is the essence of System Design, and how do you do it?”. It covers broad strokes. At some point I hope to go much deeper. Meanwhile, I hope you find this enjoyable :)</em>  </p><hr><p>What is a hacker’s paradise?</p><p>My vote would be the beginning years of a startup. </p><p>The whole system fits in your head. All your problems are important, and you can solve them any way you like. You’re spinning clay while the world is pouring concrete. If you love to create it’s easy to see: despite all the schleps of a startup, an environment with speed, independence, and changeability is paradise.</p><h2>Elephant</h2><p>But we know this doesn’t last long. When those same startups become big, most of them slow down to a crawl. Why is that?</p><p>In one of Rich Hickey’s talks, he made a metaphor that could explain it. Paraphrased, he said “Your system grows into an elephant. Every new feature is you teaching it new tricks”. </p><p>The larger and hairier the elephant, the harder it is to teach it tricks. And, of course some tricks become off-limits: you can’t teach an elephant to do backflips.</p><p>So companies slow down because their systems get large and hairy. Is that the only reason? I don’t think so, but it is certainly one of the biggest. An argument could be made for organizational issues: there’s a cost to lots of people working together. But systems grow exponentially in size, so even if everyone agreed and they worked together perfectly, I’d bet that system complexity would take a fair amount of the blame.</p><h2>System Design</h2><p>Taming that elephant, I think, is the essence of system design. So how do we <em>do s</em>ystem design?</p><p>A lot of complex ideas come to mind when we think about what’s involved: Robustness, performance, stability, safety, scale. These are all important concepts, but I think they are not the central goal. </p><p>The central goal is much simpler. It’s singular and defensive. Remember that when we started, we already <em>had</em> a hacker’s paradise, Our goal is to hold the fort. To do this, just one idea encapsulates it all: changeability. Changeability maximizes the impact an engineer can have on your system, and at the end of the day it’s those engineers who can affect <em>any</em> improvement to your system. This means that robustness, performance, stability, safety, scale, and all else are dependent on changeability. </p><p>System design is then the constant answer to the question: “How can I make my system as changeable as possible?”. That’s a simpler question, but the answer is no less difficult. Note one more surprising bit about it: we must answer this question differently over time. This means that design is dependent on time and context. Your answer can be right if applied at T0, but wrong if applied at T200. </p><h2>Guide</h2><p>Now, if making our system as changeable as possible is our primary act, how do we do it? </p><p>First, we’ll need to start off with the <em>maximum level of changeability.</em> Systems that are maximally changeable are as simple as possible. A simple system is the system that solves a problem with the minimum amount of specific concepts, in a way that keeps all these concepts as decoupled as possible.</p><p>That implies a few things: we would want to choose the most powerful language we can to solve our problem. This lets us use the most powerful abstractions, which will allow us to keep the number of specific concepts that define our program at a minimum. We would want to use powerful, immutable data structures, which will help us keep our abstractions concise and decoupled. It also means that we would want to use the simplest infrastructure we need to solve our problem. Simpler infrastructure allows us to avoid introducing concepts that aren’t needed to solve our problems. The same applies for the abstractions we choose: we’d want to use the abstractions that best solve for our specific use cases, rather than solve generally for potential future usecases we don’t have.</p><p>Note that if you follow these ideas, your initial system may look like a toy. It certainly won’t use kubernetes. Remember that system design is context-dependent, and at this point in time this <em>is</em> the best solution.</p><p>Now, we must iterate. At every step of the way, ask: what’s slowing down our productivity? Pick the highest impact issues and start to address them. Privacy getting too hairy? Introduce an abstraction that centralizes the complexity of privacy, and removes it from the realm of product engineering. Site going down too much? Introduce infrastructure for detection and debugging. Once that’s not enough, consider incident management systems.</p><p>The common theme here: centralize and push complexity down. You take pieces of complexity that <em>every</em> engineer needs to deal with, and create an interface they can use which abstracts the complexity away. As you do that, you try to make that infrastructure accessible: this means it’s written in a place where every engineer can access, in a language that every engineer can change. That will enable all engineers to use your abstraction, while having the option to dive deeper.</p><p>The fact that system design is iterative has two importance consequences. </p><p>The first is that you cannot escape technical debt. Because a solution at T0 becomes more and more incorrect as context changes, you are constantly accruing technical debt. Because of this, <em>there can be no perfect system.</em> It’s your job to constantly manage the tradeoff between quality and debt, and this iterative cycle is your sword.</p><p>The second is that applying blanket solutions will lead to failure. As you get more technical debt, you will invariably end up with a desire to enforce a new paradigm on the system: microservices being the common one today. Because a paradigm solves <em>multiple</em> general *<em>issues, you invariably introduce some concepts that don’t </em>specifically<em> solve your issues, and have their own tradeoffs. The solution is again to lean in to the iterative model: apply </em>specific<em> solutions to </em>specific<em> problems</em>.*</p><h2>Debt</h2><p>As you iterate, you’ll constantly run into the struggle between accruing and paying down debt: do you slow down your velocity <em>now</em> to improve future changeability <em>later</em>? The context we work in is so complicated that there can’t be a simple formula here. But, like in most craft, we can lean in rules of thumb.</p><p>The first problem comes when you are considering <em>introducing</em> new debt. The key rule to consider here is the nature of the debt. Not all debt are created equal — some have higher interest. Let’s compare two examples to illustrate. The first involves introducing a staging environment, or improving performance. This does not get appreciably harder <em>later.</em> Compare that to knowingly introducing a data model change, that you <em>know</em> you’ll need to migrate later. This involves significantly more incidental work: dual writes, backfills, shadow testing, the whole schebang. Based on the nature of the debt and the importance of your current commitments, you need to balance and make a choice.</p><p>The second problem comes when you are considering <em>paying down</em> debt. The key rule to consider here is pain. You already have a sense of the debt that is either causing the biggest slow down, or is about too. It’s difficult to measure your success here, as if you do your job well, no one will even feel the pain. Nevertheless this skill can be learned from your mistakes. First fix what causes the most pain immediately. Then, get better and better at pre-empting the largest amount of pain earlier. That, granted is a lofty goal — I have never worked at a company where there wasn’t at least one glaring way to make things a magnitude better.</p><h2>Fin</h2><p>So we come down to the central idea. To keep your hacker’s paradise you need to tame your system complexity elephant. To do that, you need to keep your system as changeable as possible. To do that, you need to start out with a simple system, and evolve it iteratively as you grow. There’s so much more I want to go deeper into, but that will have to wait for another. I hope this gives you a good model to think with.</p><p><em>Thanks to Mark Shlick, Jacky Wang, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Popkhadze, David Magaltadze, Irakli Safareli, for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><span>T</span>his spring, a group of schoolboys in Delhi played an obscene guessing game. In a group chat on Instagram, one boy shared a photo of<strong> </strong>a girl with the group, challenging the others to guess her age. The prize for a correct guess: her social media handle. “Bad dressing sense,” one boy <a href="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1588744369584-bois-locker-room.jpeg?resize=1575:*">commented</a>. “ikr [I know right],” replied the original poster, “But good tits.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the alleged victims of the group, which became known as the Bois Locker Room chat, was Madhuri, a 17-year-old girl in Bangalore who asked to be identified by a pseudonym. She told <em>Rest of World</em> that, in April, she received an unsolicited message from one of the boys requesting nude photographs. “I refused, but he kept on insisting,” she said. She showed <em>Rest of World</em> a screenshot of his response: “You motherfucker. Send me pictures of your breasts. How dare you say no to me?” The boy then superimposed Madhuri’s face onto a pornographic picture and sent it to her. She blocked him. But a month later, she realized he also shared the picture on the Bois Locker Room chat. She soon learned she<strong> </strong>was not the only one. The group had targeted multiple underage girls with photo manipulation. “It was disgusting,” she said. “One boy replied that he preferred bigger breasts. Another said he’d like to rape me.” What Madhuri didn’t do is go to the police. “They don’t take [sexual-harassment cases] very seriously,” Madhuri told me. “Besides, my parents would have felt bad about me going public. You know what it’s like for girls. We’d be blamed first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet Madhuri and the other victims would soon attain some measure of justice via unconventional means. She sent the screenshots to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shubhamcybercop/">@shubhamsinghcybercop</a>, an Instagram user who had quietly begun investigating the case.<strong> </strong>After recording her statement, he asked if she wished to submit a legal complaint; she declined. </p>



<p>The operator of the account is Shubham Singh, a 25-year-old wunderkind digital detective of sorts in Mumbai, some 1,400 kilometers away. He regards himself as a private investigator, gathering information to verify claims of online harassment and encouraging victims to pursue legal action. His vigilantism — what he calls “ethical hacking” — resides somewhere on the spectrum between the formal justice of the courts and the informal justice of the social-media tribunal. Despite his unorthodox methods, he has quickly become one of India’s most popular cybercrime&nbsp;experts, assisting Mumbai’s police in cases ranging from petty fraud to kidnapping, and even occasionally lending a hand to anti-terrorism efforts.</p>



<p>Several weeks after Madhuri’s exchange with the boy, screenshots from the Bois Locker Room were leaked onto <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bois-locker-room-delhi-schoolboys-create-group-to-share-lewd-photos-chats-on-classmates-1674303-2020-05-04">social media</a> after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashnaaasharmaa/">@ashnaaasharmaa</a>, an Instagram influencer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17890085584516759/">shared</a> a list of the boys’ handles and requested that her followers expose “[t]hese cunts.” The story revealed that most of the boys attended several prominent private schools in Saket, an affluent South Delhi suburb. The details were shocking: In the chat — which included roughly 30 boys, some as young as 15 — the boys rated the attractiveness of underage girls’ bodies and exchanged their personal information. Some even shared lewd tales of alleged<strong> </strong>sexual encounters with the girls. National media outlets <a href="https://qz.com/india/1850737/delhi-boyslockerroom-chat-puts-spotlight-on-india-rape-culture/">swarmed</a> over the story, as Indian social media erupted in outrage. As <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXKrLUnUEAE3SAs.jpg">more screenshots</a> from the chat emerged, the group members threatened to rape or leak nude photographs of the whistleblowers. One said: “I am going to Fuck every single [girl] who posted on their story” — a threat newspapers interpreted as rape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the Bois’ plans for revenge would be foiled, thanks in part to Singh. Over a Skype <em>chai</em> in late May,<strong> </strong>he told <em>Rest of World</em> that an influencer had tipped him off about the case by tagging him in an Instagram story and asking for his assistance in finding the boys. He said that soon after the story appeared, his inbox was flooded with screenshots from alleged victims. “On an average day, I get 10 to 20 messages,” he said, “but this time, I must have gotten over 200.” He had only a few blurred screenshots from the Bois’ chat that had gone viral — fearing public retaliation, members had deleted their Instagram accounts, seemingly eliminating any evidence. How, then, did he track them down? “Us ethical hackers, we have our techniques,” he grinned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh explained that he first asked the girls who had approached him to send him screen recordings to confirm their stories. Next, he used a special tracking software to find their email addresses via their Instagram handles. After confirming those addresses, he searched Facebook for accounts registered under those emails and compared their Instagram pictures to those<strong> </strong>posted to<strong> </strong>their Facebook accounts.<strong> </strong>Once he confirmed the identities of the nine boys who were active participants in the leaked chats, Singh forwarded a WhatsApp message containing his findings<strong> </strong>to a police officer in New Delhi. He received no response. So he tracked down the boys’ parents and called them. “Since they were minors,” he said, “I wouldn’t speak to them directly. But their parents needed to know what their children were up to. I recommended that the boys seek counseling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh then shared the names of the nine boys on his own Instagram account. Their handles were also posted publicly by “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallofshamereal/?hl=en">Wall of Shame Real</a>,” an anonymous Instagram page that names and shames alleged sexual offenders. Its administrator invited the page’s 35,000-plus followers to bring forward more screenshots and stories of harassment that could be used as evidence against the boys. “Their parents have been informed. Now, for the real action, you need to step up and help sir [Singh] in the case,” the post read. (The administrator of the Wall of Shame Real page did not return<em> Rest of World</em>’s request for comment.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>On May 6, the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admin-of-instagram-group-bois-locker-room-arrested-devices-seized/story-9tQDaF32QglX2tnyGPP6wI.html"><em>Hindustan Times</em> reported</a> that the Delhi police had apprehended an administrator of the group chat — the result of a social media furor fomented, in large part, by Singh. With their elite private-school pedigrees and social-media savvy, these boys seemed to alert India to a generation of young people doing whatever they wanted to whomever they chose to — as much online as elsewhere in the world. It is still unclear what the consequences will be for the boys of Bois Locker Room, though many have been questioned by the police in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Singh’s decision to share the boys’ Instagram handles, some of which revealed their full names, seemed to skirt an ethical line. But he insisted that their handles had already been shared publicly before his involvement in the matter. “I don’t believe in trial by social media. Instagram is not a courtroom. I always verify my claims before I post them,” he said. At the same time, he acknowledged: “Sometimes, to get justice, you need to do unethical things.”</p>



<p>The Bois Locker Room<strong> </strong>case struck a chord with Indians still convulsed with anger over the treatment of women in their country. In 2012, a fatal gang rape on a bus in Delhi enraged the country and spurred legal and judicial reforms. Yet the horror remains. According to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rape-factbox/statistics-on-rape-in-india-and-some-well-known-cases-idUSKBN1YA0UV">latest statistics</a>, every day, 90 rapes are reported in India, but many more go unreported, due to fears and stigma.&nbsp;In the first three and a half months of 2018, more than five women were raped every day in the capital city. In February, a man <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51398295">allegedly raped a 5-year-old girl</a> within the grounds of the U.S. Embassy in Delhi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critics argue that the government has failed to address the heart of the problem: cultural notions of purity that lead third parties, particularly law enforcement, to blame the victim. A longtime police inspector with the<strong> </strong>Mumbai Crime Branch, who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> on condition of anonymity, said that victims of sex crimes directly approach private investigators such as Singh out of convenience, not frustration. “If you lodge a claim, you will have to be questioned, have a character certificate taken … these things take a few days. People think going to the police is a waste of time — if I advertised free private help on Facebook, why wouldn’t people come to me? It’s just easier.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inspector disagreed that police fail to adequately protect sexual-harassment victims. “There may have been cases where officers behaved badly, but the government has now made lots of changes to help girls feel more comfortable approaching the police,” he said. “There are dedicated lady officers and help lines for sexual-harassment cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The numbers would appear to back him up: Between 2012 and 2015, cases of rape reported to the police increased by 39%, perhaps suggesting victims have become more willing to come forward. But victims still claim law enforcement dissuades them from pressing charges. They often suffer humiliation at police stations and hospitals, according to a 2017 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/11/08/everyone-blames-me/barriers-justice-and-support-services-sexual-assault-survivors">paper</a> by Human Rights Watch. Even when police do cooperate with victims, the legal system often fails them. According to 2018 data from India’s National Crime Records Bureau, only <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/conviction-in-crimes-against-dalits-is-abysmally-low-mha-report/articleshow/63833473.cms">27.2%</a>&nbsp;of state prosecutions for rape in India led to a conviction. By contrast, the <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/annual-violence-against-women-and-girls-report-published-0">corresponding figure</a> for 2017 to 2018 in the United Kingdom stood at 58%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rukmini Sen, a sociologist with the Ambedkar University Delhi, said India’s male-dominated police force still stigmatizes victims of sexual violence. “Time and again, various initiatives are announced … and clearly all of these attempts have either not been properly carried forward or have not created enough confidence in women,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">previous blog post</a>, we learned how to start to create charts in <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/">Superset</a> and specifically <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">how to create a composition charts</a> to understand understand how data is formed. This, in turn, can be used to determine which chart type is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>In this blog article we will explore the topic of time series data, visualization options, and how to best represent time series data in order to facilitate trend analysis. Data used in the examples below is available in a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eugeniamz/ce_test_db/master/Covid19_CasesTS_data.csv">GitHub repository</a> — you can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4sjmAKaJ6M&amp;t=3s">view instructions</a> on how to import the file into your own database.</p>
<h2 id="why-time-series-charts"><a href="#why-time-series-charts" aria-label="why time series charts permalink"></a>Why Time Series Charts</h2>
<p>Time series data is important because it is used to understand and analyze data behavior over time. Using historical data, time series charts enable companies to spot trends, changes in behavior, and compare different metrics to visualize correlations. Examples of time series analysis includes website visits, sales trends, and IoT (Internet of Things) data.</p>
<p>In a time series chart, you represent a independent variable (time) vs. dependent variables (metrics) to analyze behavior over time.</p>
<p>In the example of Covid-19 data, a time series chart will enable you to answer critical questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the number of Confirmed Cases decreasing? (trend)</li>
<li>Did we flatten the curve? (trends)</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between confirmed cases and deaths?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="times-series-analysis-with-superset"><a href="#times-series-analysis-with-superset" aria-label="times series analysis with superset permalink"></a>Times Series Analysis with Superset</h2>
<p>Superset has a rich library of time series graphs for different use cases, such as: Line Charts, Area Charts, Time Series Bar Charts, Dual Line Charts, Calendar Heat Maps, Horizon Charts, and more. In this article, we will show examples of some of these charts and how changing a visualization type can dramatically change how data is displayed for trend analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Time Field:</strong> This is a independent variable and is represented on the X-axis. Options in the Time Column drop-down are fields that have the option temporal in the Columns field within the data source. The Time Grain drop-down indicates the data aggregated label used when displaying the metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics:</strong> This is a required field and represents the dependent variables that will be displayed on the Y-axis.</p>
<p>All the other fields are optional, but it is important to keep in mind that an efficient chart is a simple chart — therefore, be sure to reduce the use of filters, granularity, and limit the series represented in the Group By and Series limit fields. By default, the Series limit field uses the first metric value to cut off values but, alternatively, the Sort By field allows you to filter data with an additional data point.</p>
<h2 id="time-series-bar-chart"><a href="#time-series-bar-chart" aria-label="time series bar chart permalink"></a>Time Series Bar Chart</h2>
<p>Time series bar charts represent categories by vertical charts.</p>

<p>In this example, you can see that the numbers of dates (last 3 months ~90 bars) are too wide to be represented on the screen — this is a good opportunity to reduce the date granularity in order to reduce the data points on the X-axis.</p>

<p>However, adding too many series (e.g., many distinct values in the Group By field) could make it difficult to understand and conceptualize the series. In this case, it is useful to use Series Limit to reduce the number of series.</p>

<h2 id="area-chart"><a href="#area-chart" aria-label="area chart permalink"></a>Area Chart</h2>
<p>Area chart are similar to line chart in that they represent variables with the same scale, but area charts stack the metrics on top of each other. An area chart in Superset can be stream, stack, or expand.</p>
<p>By simply changing the Visualization Type, we can display the line chart above as an area chart</p>

<p>Sometimes when looking at data points on a per day basis, it is difficult to determine trends and data variance. For example, the chart below shows the top American states with new Covid-19 cases on a per day basis (taken over the last month). This view makes it difficult to discern a clear trend.</p>

<p>In order to gain a greater insight into this data, we recommend smoothing out the short-term fluctuations between data points by applying a moving average. The moving average—available in the <em>Advance Analytics function</em>—applies the average between defined X periods instead of marking actual data points by date.</p>
<p>If we apply this technique to the previous chart by using the moving average over the last 7 days, the lines in the chart will be smoothed out and facilitate the recognition of trends.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
			<p>In this post we are going to see how to build a basic decision tree classifier using scikit-learn package and how to use it for doing multi-class classification on a dataset.</p>

<p>Decision trees is an efficient and non-parametric method that can be applied either to classification or to regression tasks.</p>

<p>To predict the dependent variable the input space is split into local regions because they are hierarchical data structures for supervised learning</p>

<p>Decision tree is a simple to learn and easy to interpret and Visualize the decisions in a tree format. It has the advantage of producing comprehensible classification/regression model with satisfactory accuracy level.</p>

<p>We will be exploring the DecisionTreeClassifier function of sklearn and all the parameters of it. You will also see how to Visualize the decision tree Rules and the Boundaries that model is creating to classify the different Classes(targets)</p>

<h2 id="decision-tree-classifier-in-sklearn"><strong>Decision Tree Classifier in Sklearn</strong></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(_criterion='gini'_,&nbsp;_splitter='best'_,&nbsp;_max_depth=None_,
&nbsp;
_min_samples_split=2_,&nbsp;_min_samples_leaf=1_,&nbsp;_min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0_,&nbsp;_max_features=None_,&nbsp;

_random_state=None_,&nbsp;_max_leaf_nodes=None_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_decrease=0.0_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_split=None_,&nbsp;

_class_weight=None_,&nbsp;&nbsp;_ccp_alpha=0.0_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="parameters"><strong>Parameters</strong></h2>

<h3 id="criterion"><strong>criterion</strong></h3>

<p>Gini or entropy and default is Gini.</p>

<p>One of the Critical factor is to choose which feature for splitting the nodes in subsets and for making that decision we choose out of these two criteria</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information Theory (Entropy)</li>
  <li>Distance Based (Gini)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both are impurity measures and it looks like the selection of impurity measure has little effect on the performance of single decision tree algorithms</p>

<p>The impurity is measured before and after splitting a node according to each possible attribute.</p>

<p>The attribute which presents the greater gain in purity, i.e., that maximizes the difference of impurity taken before and after splitting the node, is chosen</p>

<p>Entropy might be a little slower to compute because it makes use of the logarithm</p>

<h3 id="splitter"><strong>Splitter</strong></h3>

<p>Strategy to choose out of best or random. Default is best</p>

<p>If the best strategy is chosen then it will split on the most important feature first</p>

<p>it will choose a feature on random for splitting the node if splitter set to random which could lead to accuracy and more depth in the decision tree</p>

<h3 id="max_depth"><strong>max_depth</strong></h3>

<p>The maximum depth of the tree.</p>

<p>One of the stopping criteria that let you decide when to terminate the tree building process. A tree can be grown until a maximum depth is reached.</p>

<p>A tree can be grown to a maximum depth of N-1 where N is the number of samples</p>

<p>Beside max_depth there are other stopping criteria as well so in reality a tree will never go a maximum depth of N-1</p>

<p>Mostly we try to pick the optimal depth based on cross-validation and decides the reasonable max_depth value</p>

<h3 id="min_samples_split"><strong>min_samples_split</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at an Internal node for splitting. Say for example min_samples_split = 5 and there are 8 samples at a decision node then the split is allowed otherwise if &lt;5 then not allowed.</p>

<p>if <strong>min_sample_leaf</strong> = 2 and one leaf has 1 sample and other has 6 samples then the split is not allowed</p>

<p>so min_samples_split depends on the min-sample_leaf defined as well</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-6.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="min_samples_leaf"><strong>min_samples_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at a leaf node</p>

<h3 id="min_weight_fraction_leaf"><strong>min_weight_fraction_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum weighted fraction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>`fit`(_self_,&nbsp;_X_,&nbsp;_y_,&nbsp;_sample_weight=None_,&nbsp;_check_input=True_,&nbsp;_X_idx_sorted=None_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>this parameter decides the required fraction of samples (or weights) in each leaf node</p>

<p>It uses the weight defined for each sample thru the fit method that has a <strong>sample_weight</strong> which lets you specify the weight of each of the samples and accepts values in an array like format for n_samples</p>

<p>if a minimum weight fraction is set and the sample weight is None then it will assume a uniform weight for all the samples</p>

<h3 id="max_features"><strong>max_features</strong></h3>

<p>It defines the number of features to be used for best split.</p>

<p>It is used to control the over-fitting. For example if the shape of your data is 30 and max_feature is set to 5.</p>

<p>So Every time at a decision node you will choose maximum of 5 features that are selected randomly for splitting</p>

<h3 id="random_state"><strong>random_state</strong></h3>

<p>It is the seed used by the random number generator. it is basically used to make the result or outcome of the classifier consistent.</p>

<p>It hardly matters what number you select but if you select the same number each time then the output remains deterministic</p>

<h3 id="max_leaf_node"><strong>max_leaf_node</strong></h3>

<p>maximum leaf node. It is one of the stopping criteria to grow a tree wih max_leaf_node.</p>

<p>By default it is set to None which means it will grow to unlimited leaf nodes and other stopping criteria will be considered</p>

<p>from the official <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html">documentation</a> the formula for weighted impurity decrease is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This formula takes into account how much the parent node makes up of the total tree (N_t / N) and the weighted impurity decrease from the child nodes.</p>

<p>If the final impurity decrease is less than the minimum impurity decrease parameter, then the split will not be performed</p>

<h3 id="class_weight"><strong>class_weight</strong></h3>

<p>By default all the classes have same weight i.e. 1</p>

<p>The class_weight parameter deals well with unbalanced classes by giving
more weight to the under represented classes.</p>

<p>It is used for re-weighting the splitting criterion</p>

<p>Higher the class_weight more you want to put emphasis on that class.</p>

<p>For multi-output, class_weights will be multiplied with <strong>sample_weight</strong> (passed through the fit method) if <strong>sample_weight</strong> is specified</p>

<h2 id="get-started"><strong>Get Started</strong></h2>

<p>We will use the wine dataset from sklearn.</p>

<p>Let’s load the data and then will split into train and test sets</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
wine_data = datasets.load_wine()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s check out the important keys in this dataset</p>



<div><div><pre><code>dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names'])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we have data, target variables with their names stored in target_names and feature names</p>

<p>Let’s find out the features in the data that we will use to train the decision tree classifier</p>



<div><div><pre><code>['alcohol',
 'malic_acid',
 'ash',
 'alcalinity_of_ash',
 'magnesium',
 'total_phenols',
 'flavanoids',
 'nonflavanoid_phenols',
 'proanthocyanins',
 'color_intensity',
 'hue',
 'od280/od315_of_diluted_wines',
 'proline']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are the different classes or targets in which each of these data is classified to i.e. class_0, class_1 and class_2</p>



<div><div><pre><code>**array(['class_0', 'class_1', 'class_2'], dtype='&lt;U7')**
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally lets check the data by importing it into a Dataframe object. So you can visualize how the data looks like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(wine_data.data,columns=wine_data.feature_names)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see there are 178 rows and 13 features in this dataset.</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-7.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="train-test-split"><strong>Train Test Split</strong></h2>

<p>We have split the data into training and test set using sklearn train_test_split</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
stratify=y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="accuracy-score-and-cross-validation"><strong>Accuracy Score and Cross Validation</strong></h2>

<p>Lets measure the testing accuracy using sklearn accuracy_score.</p>

<p>For that we are going to instantiate the Decision tree classifier and then use the fit method on Train data.</p>

<p>Predict method of decision tree classifier will find the target class for the test data</p>

<p>Finally we will calculate the accuracy on our test data prediction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier() #Instantiate Decision tree classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)      # Use fit method on the train data

y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)   # Predict the target class of test data
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # Measure Accuracy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s evaluate the cross validation score as well</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(clf, X_test, y_test, cv=5)
print("Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (scores.mean(), scores.std() * 2))
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="visualize-decision-tree-using-plot_tree"><strong>Visualize Decision Tree using plot_tree</strong></h2>

<p>You can also Visualize the final decision tree by using the plot_tree function of the sklearn.</p>

<p>There are other ways to visualize using pydot and graphviz but I’m not going to discuss those methods in this post</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
figure(num=None, figsize=(20, 6), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
plot_tree(clf.fit(wine_data.data, wine_data.target))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="gridsearchcv"><strong>GridSearchCV</strong></h2>

<p>Hyper parameters selection is an important part for model selection. how would you know what combinations of these parameters will give you the best outcome?</p>

<p>One way is randomly selecting these values and see which combinations of parameters will give best result.</p>

<p>Isn’t that tedious to do? So Grid Search in Scikit-learn exactly does the same thing and helps to find the best estimator</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
param_grid = {'criterion':['gini','entropy'], 'max_depth' :
[3,5,7,20]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf,param_grid=param_grid,cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see all the criteria and their respective score that gridsearch used to evaluate the best estimate by accessing the params and mean_test_score of grid search object</p>

<p>The params and the mean_test_score keys will give you the parameters and their corresponding results</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grid_search.cv_results_['params']
grid_search.cv_results_['mean_test_score']
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>([{'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 3},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 5},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 7},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 20},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 3},

			<p><a href="#"><img alt="Of WWDC, Intel, and some ramblings about what this might mean" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IntelApple.jpeg"></a></p><!-- .entry-header --><p>So <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">WWDC 2020</a> – Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference happened last week, between the 22nd and 26th of June. Despite being the first-ever virtual-only WWDC due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a lot happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 is now available in beta for developers,</li>
<li>we now have Scribble to help us to literally ‘scribble’ on our iOS devices,</li>
<li>we can arrange our widgets on the home screen,</li>
<li>get cycling directions (EV Routing),</li>
<li>and have Digital Car Keys.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_3970"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3970" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14.jpeg" alt="WWDC2020, iOS14" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14.jpeg 680w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14-600x338.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3970">WWDC2020, iOS14</p></div>
<p>All these announcements and more were by all means exciting, including the all amazing Big Sur to customize our Memoji on our Macs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4An0ndagZsQ">Watch here</a> in case you missed #WWDC2020 and want to catch a glimpse.</p>
<p>However, the most shocking announcement, which we really are all talking about is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/technology/apple-macs-intel-chips.html">Big Break up between Apple and Intel</a>. Well, it doesn’t entirely come as a shocker, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/apple-reportedly-to-switch-from-intel-processors-in-macs.html">Steve Jobs had implied it. But that was 15 years ago.</a></p>
<p>So, today, we take you with us down this rabbit hole, with a little snooping around, since after all, Apple’s and Intel’s is our business too, so it’s kind of okay if we put our nose in it.</p>
<h2>The reception of the news</h2>
<p>We did a little snooping as we went down this rabbit hole just to get ‘the sentiments’. There were people who as usual turned to our de facto way of communicating these days: memes.</p>
<div id="attachment_3972"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3972" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon.png" alt="Apple Ditches Intel" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon.png 1366w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-300x169.png 300w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-600x337.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3972">Apple Ditches Intel</p></div>
<p>And like many of us, we began to wonder why. Could it be that Apple wants to ‘pack some more power’ into their batteries?</p>

<div id="attachment_3975"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3975" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Plat40m-1.png" alt="Intel Battery Power" width="559" height="681" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Plat40m-1.png 559w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Plat40m-1-246x300.png 246w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3975">Intel Battery Power</p></div>
<h2>What caused the breakup?</h2>
<p>Since we are curious human beings with a little detective muscle in us that we like to exercise a bit (we don’t want to suffer from atrophy), we sought to get to the bottom of this turn of events.</p>
<p>Better still, on a more serious note, because we are techies, we need to understand what implications this has in the industry as a whole. We code in Swift, by the way.</p>
<p>And thirdly, even more seriously, we are a business and no one just leaves their 15-year long partnership without a good reason.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy theories</h3>
<p>There are a lot of conspiracy theories going around since Apple did not officially state the reason for the breakup.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy theory #1</h3>
<p>Like we have mentioned, Steve Jobs had implied that the break up would be inevitable. He said that Intel would be pivotal in helping Apple build powerful computers for the ‘next decade’. He did not say whether the processors would still be relevant after that, which implied that there was a likely breakup.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy theory #2</h3>
<div id="attachment_3976"><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Skylake-CPU-and-Arria-10-FPGA-from-Intel-Intel-Hybrid-chips-that-combine-FPGAs-with_fig1_329894874"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3976" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skylake.jpg" alt="Intel-Apple Skylake" width="283" height="286" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skylake.jpg 283w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skylake-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3976">Intel-Apple Skylake</p></div>
<p>According to <a href="https://youtu.be/JImi0Vnjvfw">François Piednoël, Former Intel Corp Performance Guru</a> Skylack’s line of processors’ Quality Assurance was ‘bad’. In his words, “Our buddies at Apple became the number one filers of problems in the Architecture”.</p>
<p>The numerous bugs on Skylack were the straw stroke that broke the camel’s back, for an Apple that was already contemplating on moving on from their processor partner, Intel. François also cited internal wrangles within Intel.</p>
<h2>What does this all mean?</h2>
<p>So as we try to process this new shocker, this news means several things. Let’s explore them below:</p>
<h3>#1 Apple definitely has more control</h3>
<p>Apple will be able to consolidate its devices and software to run seamlessly and cross-platform. iOS and iPadOS apps will be able to run on Mac, for example. The company will also be able to make higher quality products with higher processing speeds and that can do the ‘heavy lifting’, for example, gaming.</p>
<h3>#2 Apple users might want to wait for the new ARM/silicon-based Macs</h3>
<p>A survey by @tiborbodecs on Twitter showed that users might want to take this route:</p>
<div id="attachment_3977"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3977" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503.jpeg" alt="Apple ARM-based Macs" width="947" height="1950" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503.jpeg 947w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-146x300.jpeg 146w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-497x1024.jpeg 497w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-768x1581.jpeg 768w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-746x1536.jpeg 746w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-600x1235.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3977">Apple ARM-based Macs</p></div>
<p>Since the transition will take two years, Intel-based products still in the pipeline will still be released. The only problem could be that users may not want to buy them.</p>
<h3>#3 Old Intel-based apps will continue to work on the new ARM-based Macs</h3>
<p>Apple had already laid the groundwork with <a href="https://www.apple.com/rosetta/index.html">Rossetta 2</a>, an emulator that is able to compile code written to run on Intel architecture to run on ARM. The company will also continue to support Intel-based Macs. So, don’t ditch your Mac yet.</p>
<p>Intel-based apps will run slower on the new Macs, though, as Rossetta will need time to translate the code.</p>
<h3>#4 Developers need to upskill to build apps that can run on the new ARM-based Macs</h3>
<p>Rossetta is only a temporary solution. For developers, you are better off getting the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/universal/">Developer Transition Kit </a>to prepare yourself to start building native apps to run on the new ARM-based Macs, come 2021.</p>
<div id="attachment_3978"><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/universal/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3978" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09.png" alt="Apple Developer Transition Kit" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09.png 1366w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-300x169.png 300w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-600x337.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3978">Apple Developer Transition Kit</p></div>
<h3>#5 Big Tech Companies might follow suit</h3>
<p>To an extent, Apple’s move from Intel’s x86’s processors is a benchmark. If the transition is successful, then other companies are likely to follow suit. In an interview with <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/06/09/apple-intel-arm-chip-shift-mac/">Fortune Magazine</a>, HP and Acer said they had laptop models powered by ARM-based chips. Samsung and Lenovo do have ARM-based laptops too.</p>
<h2>When should we expect new Macs?</h2>
<p>The<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/21/kuo-13-3-inch-macbook-pro-and-imac-will-be-the-first-arm-macs-to-be-released-as-soon-as-q4-after-redesigned-intel-imac-launch/"> first ARM-based Mac</a> is set to be released in Q4, 2020, or in Q1, 2021, and they are highly likely to result in a 50 to 100% increase in performance when compared to their older Intel-based counterparts. We should have an ARM-based Macbook by mid-2021.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Apple might have brought back the good ol’ days where processor speed was a thing:</p>

<p>All the same, we are all waiting to see how things will unfold.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We're now 4 months into building <a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, which means another major update. Here's a few things we think you'll love in this release.</p><h3>4 minute demo</h3><p>Watch a full demo:</p><h3>View relational data</h3><p>We're sometimes asked how we will make Postgres as simple as Firebase, since Postgres is a relational database. This month we're making our first steps to prove that relational databases can be even easier to use than document stores. We're releasing an excel-like editing interface which can drill down into your relational data.</p><h3>Manage JSON data</h3><p>Postgres is an amazing database, giving the flexibility of a document store with the power of a RDBMS. If you use <code>JSON</code> data in Postgres, then we want to make that easy too. Supabase detects when your column is <code>JSON</code> or <code>JSONB</code>, and provides an easy way to edit and view your data. More improvements coming soon for this feature!</p><h3>Choose your region</h3><p>If you noticed a bit of latency on Supabase, it's because your projects were previously set up in Singapore. It was always our intention that you'd be able to choose your database region, and this month we've delivered it. In the next releases we'll even allow you to go multi-region, instantly replicating your database close to your customers.</p><h3>Backups</h3><p>A guiding principle at Supabase is zero lock-in. So this month we are exposing your daily database backups on the dashboard, giving you a simple way to migrate off Supabase. We have a lot more to build in this space (<code>WAL-G!</code>), so watch this space.</p><h3>Kaizen</h3><p>We have a number of small improvements:</p><ul><li>Improved SQL editor - with better syntax highlighting</li><li>Improved API docs - with more code snippets</li><li>UX improvements - with a simplified and consistent UX</li></ul><h3>Hiring</h3><ul><li>This month we <a href="https://supabase.io/blog/2020/06/15/supabase-steve-chavez">welcome Steve Chavez to the team</a>. Steve is a maintainer of PostgREST, one of the core tools which makes Supabase possible. </li><li>We're hiring a part-time designer or UX expert. See more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23708351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><h3>Get started</h3><ul><li>Start using Supabase today: <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">app.supabase.io</a></li><li>Make sure to <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star us on GitHub</a></li><li>Follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/supabase_io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a></li><li>Become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor</a></li></ul></section></div>]]>

<p>We are holding a competition on sample-efficient reinforcement learning using human priors. Standard methods require 
months to years of game time to attain human performance in complex games such as Go and StarCraft. In our competition,
 participants develop a system to obtain a diamond in Minecraft using only four days of training time.

<p>The MineRL competition offeres a set of Gym environments paired with human demonstrations to provide participants with
the ability to tackle the difficult Minecraft sample efficiently. This year we are introducing a new 
vectorized action and observation space that obscures the agent’s actions to prevent participants from using domain
knowlege to solve the ObtainDiamond task!</p>

<h3> The Task: Obtain Diamond in Minecraft </h3>

<p>Minecraft is a 3D, first-person, open-world game centered around the gathering of resources and creation of structures and items. These structures and items have prerequisite tools and materials required for their creation. As a result, many items require the completion of a series of natural subtasks.</p>

<p>The procedurally generated world is composed of discrete blocks that allow modification. Over the course of gameplay, players change their surroundings by gathering resources and constructing structures.</p>

<p>In this competition, the goal is to obtain a diamond. The agent begins in a random starting location without any items, and receives rewards for obtaining items which are prerequisites for diamond.</p>

<p>Most people have more to do than time to do it.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">Eisenhower Prioritization Matrix</a> is a conceptual tool for time management that can help people decide what to work on. It’s a 2x2 matrix with urgency on one axis and importance on the other.</p><figure><img src="https://bbirnbaum.com/content/images/2020/06/eisenhower_matrix-2.png"></figure><p>Urgent and important tasks, the thinking goes, should be done right away. Non-urgent but important tasks should be scheduled. Urgent and unimportant tasks should be delegated. And non-urgent, unimportant tasks shouldn’t be done at all.</p><p>The insight behind this matrix is that people often spend too much time on urgent tasks and not enough time on important tasks. So by delegating urgent but unimportant tasks, you can free up time for important things you might not get to otherwise.</p><p>I’ve found this tool to be helpful in reminding me to focus on what’s important. But it doesn’t address another problem I have: even if I’m only working on what’s important, always starting with what’s most urgent can mean that I don’t have enough time for less urgent tasks. I’m too much of a perfectionist.</p><p>For example, when I start work in the morning, I almost always need to spend some time preparing for my meetings that day. This work is both urgent (they are happening today) and important (no one else can do it). So by the logic of the Eisenhower matrix, preparing for these meetings should be the first thing that I do.</p><p>But when I follow this reasoning, I often find myself putting too much time into the meeting prep. I might second-guess what I’m doing, spend too much time researching something tangential, or get distracted by a topic unlikely to come up in the meeting. So instead of always prioritizing what's most urgent first, I've learned to practice "strategic procrastination": purposely delaying urgent tasks to constrain the amount of time that I can spend on them.</p><p>For example, at the beginning of my morning at work, I might estimate how much time I’ll need to prepare for my meetings and then delay starting that work until I have exactly that amount of time left. Before then I’ll work on one of my other, less urgent tasks. In this way, I’m leveraging the urgency of a task to limit how much time I spend on it.</p><p>Strategic procrastination is also useful on longer time scales. When I have to prepare a presentation, for example, I often find myself wasting time on minor things, like tweaking formatting, instead of developing the core content. To avoid this I employ strategic procrastination. I delay starting work on the presentation until I have just enough time to complete it.</p><p>I sometimes adjust this method when the task requires creativity. Instead of completely delaying when I begin a task, I get started right away, but I do just enough to begin thinking about it. For a presentation, I might first spend 30 minutes writing a rough outline and then put the task aside for a few weeks. This gives me a chance to ruminate on it during downtime, and I often get ideas that I wouldn’t have gotten otherwise.</p><p>There is actually some experimental evidence behind my intuition that this approach can improve creativity. As described in <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.1471">this paper</a> and in the book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3dvwnjH">Originals</a></em> (which also uses the term “strategic procrastination”), students who played video games for a moderate amount of time while working on business problems came up with more creative solutions.</p><p>Strategic procrastination comes with a major risk, of course. There’s a reason that it’s usually considered good advice to not wait until the last minute to do things. If I misestimate how much time I need to perform a task, then I either need to scramble to complete it or the quality will suffer. So strategic procrastination is only a good idea when I’m confident about long it will take or if it’s not a big deal to underperform.</p><p>As long as I consider this risk, strategic procrastination has been a helpful tool to make sure I have enough time for important but non-urgent tasks. Sometimes waiting until the last minute is exactly what makes me the most productive.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most frustrating and common experiences in the workplace is getting work blocked near the finish line. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feature is developed over the course of 3 months. In the launch meeting a manager swoops in and declares it can’t be released for security reasons.</li>
  <li>You ask your manager for feedback on a proposal. They don’t respond. You ask again. They give a cursory glance and say “looks good”. A week later you say you’re ready to send it out. Suddenly they flood the document with feedback which ruins your timeline.</li>
  <li>An entire division works on a project for weeks. The minute they make it live the VP of the division storms in and yells “revert!”. The VP is displeased with the styling and insists it can’t be shipped that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s usually one of 3 main causes for this anti-pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Laziness/mis-calculation/ego. The stakeholder thinks it’s more efficient for them to engage with something closer to the finish line than early stage. This is often a gross mis-calculation. Projects are like cruise ships - you want to get to your destination with a lot of little steering along the way, not heroics after things have veered off course.</li>
  <li>Problem 2: Bad process. A critical stakeholder isn’t procedurally involved at the right time. If you find yourself blocking projects regularly, it’s your responsibility to fix this. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Create good process</a>.</li>
  <li>Problem 3: Micromanagement. The project/proposal didn’t actually need the manager’s feedback, they just can’t help having to put their stamp on everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are simple but hard to master:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 1: If you don’t think you need to be involved early, imagine the project goes live without your feedback at all. If you’re comfortable with that, you probably don’t need to be involved early (or at all). If you do need to give feedback, do it early and along the way.</li>
  <li>Answer 2: Make sure you have a process that involves necessary stakeholders at the right time.</li>
  <li>Answer 3: Don’t micromanage.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mess up and find yourself giving major feedback near the finish line of a project, find ways to say yes and make sure you’re empathizing with the frustration that’s resulting from the late stage changes.</p>



<p>Some people actually take pride in blocking projects. Stakeholders who repeatedly view themselves as “saving the day” when it comes to tanking momentum and releases. They see themselves as a fountain of unique knowledge that prevent disasters.</p>

<p>This is almost always a result of incentives that are grossly mis-aligned. Some organizations have stakeholders who show up late in the game, who are not responsible for other teams being productive, who have 0 incentive to facilitate work and all the incentive to block things.</p>

<p>Companies should incentivize these stakeholders not only for preventing problematic releases, but also for the amount of things teams can get done to their requirements.  This ties their success to both risk management and enablement.</p>

<p>When it comes to the most popular platforms in the world, the motives behind certain feature roll-outs or a lack of early monetisation often seems to elude logic. Why hasn’t Whatsapp enabled payments sooner and Twitter moved toward monetisation more aggressively? Why did Facebook quietly roll back its influencer platform a few years ago? More recently, I find myself questioning why Instagram waited years to introduce the Checkout function that would have made it an intimidating e-commerce competitor much earlier in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these seemingly spotlight decisions fall into a deliberate strategy tied to the lifeblood of these platforms, social capital. The long game is to cultivate social capital, gamify its distribution and eventually convert it into economic capital. Although social capital, in essence, is ephemeral and intangible, society’s collective agreement that it holds value makes it so – much like money. In that sense, Social Media did for social capital what fiat did for economic capital. No longer as difficult to quantify, it has become the world’s mirror economy with value as tangible to an individual as monetary worth. The most explicit manifestation of this has been the rise of the influencer economy, the traditionally unspoken dynamics of social hierarchies and celebrity culture on steroids and now accessible to the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For social media platforms, social capital is the fuel in their engine. Their business is the pursuit of the perpetual growth of collective social capital on their platform. As the platforms reach stages of greater maturity, the conversion funnel reaches its final stages as well – the very stage Instagram is at the beginning of right now as it attempts to complete the loop of social to economic value creation. In essence, this is the fluid direction of influencer recommendations into convertible commercial transactions within the app. But the question remains – could Instagram have implemented this feature successfully years before this point? The science behind this kind of decision is delicate, social capital must be cultivated and morphed in a way that value is not depleted from or ported away from the platform. Flow theory, a psychological concept of the mind’s ideal state of engagement provides a contextual model for how social media platforms like Instagram have achieved this balance.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Gamifying social capital: creating a state of flow&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Flow theory, a broader psychological theory on how the optimal balance of skill and challenge creates a state of complete immersion is a core focus of gamification as it is applied in gaming itself, but also across various industries. When it comes to social media, platforms have built their networks through the gamification of social capital, building an immersive and engaging game-like experience around the act of accruing social capital – “how many likes did it get?” now a popular criteria for validity. Both gaming and social media tactically withhold and subsequently trigger endorphins to create products that are addictive by nature.&nbsp; A comparison of how flow is cultivated across gaming and social media reveals a lot about the very habits many of us participate in, on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Skill &amp; Challenge</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the game must produce a task challenging enough for the player but not so challenging that the player’s skill level is incapable of completing the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> building social capital (offline or online) inherently carries a degree of challenge that requires great effort to meet. The challenge is derived from your context (i.e. your friends or others on the platform) who may have larger followings or more liked photos. As a user’s ‘success’ scales, their field of comparison grows with them, and thereby the challenge increases. This is the mechanism by which individuals are incentivised to perpetually grow their own social capital and therefore the platform’s collective capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Engagement</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming:</strong> the task has to be active and engaging</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> A challenge in itself is not rewarding enough to prompt or incentivise users to continue their accrual of social capital. The natural feedback loop of validation through followers, likes and other features create psychological self-fulfilment. Sometimes there is economic utility to be derived by those who seek to leverage their social capital beyond just validation. Pursuit of this feedback loop keeps the users active and engaged in the activities of the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Reward</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the task has to have clear parameters for success. These clear parameters help to enter and maintain a ‘flow state’ as they indicate progress and quality.</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> Success on social media platforms is measured by metrics like number of followers, likes and views. For users reaping economic rewards as well, the utility of their social capital can also be measured in sponsorships, ads and other forms of social media-driven income. While the latter is not as publicly available information, both types can lead to strong signalling of one’s success on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong>&nbsp; the player must be intrinsically motivated to complete the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media: </strong>Where flow theory in gaming requires a complete blueprint of gamification to tap into the intrinsic motivation of players, socialising is a natural state of flow humans have always engaged in. The activity of building social capital is, for the most part, natural and instinctive especially when paired with the platform’s circular feedback loop for validation and reward.</p>



<h3>Making decisions and maintaining flow: the final stages</h3>



<p>Given that social media by its very nature can keep participants engaged without too much intervention, the most important element of gamification becomes the conversion of social capital into economic value. This has to be achieved without drowning the platform in mechanisms which disturb the state of flow already established.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original set of features introduced by the platform for the accumulation of social capital has a shelf life, after which users will tire of it or reach a point of saturation that skews the effort to return balance necessary for flow. At this point platforms need to extend the avenues of creation, either by innovating existing features or introducing new features. This is the kind of thinking that drives Instagram to introduce ‘stories’ as opposed to just static posts for the feed.</p>



<p>However as the features start compounding, there is an inevitable layering of game theory mechanics which could heavily influence the state of flow. For this reason, the introduction of new features has to avoid detracting from the existing balance of social capital accumulation. If a feature presented a challenge greater than the effort or skill the user was willing to part with – participation and therefore total social capital on the platform would take a hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar sense, the introduction of the Instagram Checkout was a thoughtful and timely implementation over many years of incremental introductions that maintained the state of flow for users. Instagram prioritised the maintenance of social capital within its ecosystem, choosing not to risk the pre-emptive roll out of a feature that would deplete social capital or endanger the state of flow it was cultivating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When users began tapping into off-platform mechanisms to convert their social capital into economic capital as a result of this, Instagram didn’t put up any barriers. Instagram would have seen this as priming its users for a later stage of its own conversion funnel without taking on any of the risk of disturbing its own state of flow. In 2016, when Instagram introduced Shopping tags for feed posts and later the Shopping tab in 2018, features that led to external stores for point of purchase, it was encouraging this behaviour – all the while knowing it would eventually incorporate these tested habits back into its own environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Social to economic capital: a delicate conversion</h3>



<p>Given that maintaining a state of flow is a key decision metric behind the strategies of killer platforms, a nuanced understanding of it better places us to predict how other platforms like Whatsapp and Twitter may navigate this delicate balance moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With 89% of influencers using Instagram, it ranks as the number one platform for influencer marketing – no better testament to the economic rewards Instagram will reap as it begins cashing in its unparalleled social capital. Whilst we do not have many points of comparison for social media platforms at the scale of Instagram, the social capital it has been able to accrue is an undeniably powerful metric. Instagram in 2019 brought in 20 billion USD in revenue which accounts for more than a quarter of Facebook’s revenue in that year, only projected to grow further from there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The careful transition of Instagram towards the full conversion funnel ensures its now end to end e-commerce experience is revered as a perfectly convenient segway for users as opposed to an uncomfortable push for higher revenues.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Reverse network effects and the conundrum of maintaining palatable signal to noise ratios</h3>



<p>Network effects have seen social networks grow to valuations of billions and connect millions of users. It is tempting to believe that these platforms will remain fail-proof in perpetuity. The value created in a network relies on ‘connection, content and clout’.</p>



<p>“Across these three drivers, a network with greater scale provides greater value in the form of:</p>
